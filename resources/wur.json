                "text": "This lecture is about growth kinetics and factors influencing growth.\nFood products can spoil due to microbial growth. Organisms need to be there, but they also need to grow to reach a spoilage level. This lecture will be about factors influencing this growth. [CLICK] \nIf we investigate microbial growth, we often make a growth curve where we plot the logarithm of the number of microorganisms against time. First the microorganisms need to adapt to the food product and they are in a lag phase. Then they will start to grow exponentially. Then at a certain moment they deteriorate their environment and they will reach a stationary phase, after which they even might decrease in a death phase. However, for microbial spoilage of food, the spoilage level is generally much below the place where the stationary phase is reached. Therefore, the maximum shelf life is largely before the stationary phase. This is a microbial growth curve describing the development of the number of organisms as function of time. [CLICK]\nFor spoilage, the lag phase and the exponential phase are the most important. And we are now going to investigate this exponential phase of microbial growth. [CLICK]\nFor that we are going to look more in detail how microorganisms do grow. If a microorganism is well adapted to its environment, it has its nutrients and the environment is such that it can grow, the temperature, pH and so on, it will start to multiply. And it generally divides at approximately constant time intervals, which is called the generation time. It is comparable to human beings. In principle we could multiple ourselves after about fifteen years. So, we have a generation time of about fifteen years. However, microorganisms grow much faster. They have a generation time more in the neighborhood of fifteen minutes. After one generation time, or doubling time, we get to a next generation. At time zero [CLICK] we have generation zero, we have one cell. The number of cells is then 2 to the power of 0, which is one. If the generation time is twenty minutes, after twenty minutes, [CLICK] we have our first generation. The cells have divided and we now have 2 cells. You have one generation, 2 to the power 1 is equal to 2 cells. Again, after twenty minutes, [CLICK] we are now at forty minutes and have generation two. Again, the number of cells divide, the 2 cells now become 4 cells. It is 2 to the power 2, which is 4 cells. After one hour we enter the third generation. [CLICK] Again, we had 4 cells, they divide and we get 8 cells, so we are at generation three, and 2 to the power 3 is 8 cells. This continues. Then, if we would have one whole working day, [CLICK]after 8 hours, if the generation time is twenty minutes, we have twenty-four generations. That means that we have 2 to the power 24 cells, which is 1.7 times 10 to the power 7 cells. You can see that if the conditions are suitable and we start at one cell, after one working day we can get to 1.7 times 10 to the power 7 cells. That is more than ten million cells that can be created. That was about the spoilage level of a food product. If the conditions are appropriate, within one day we can get from one cell to the spoilage level of a food product. That shows that exponential growth of microorganisms will occur. [CLICK]\nIf we plot this in a graph, and we do that on a linear scale, it seems that in the beginning there is no growth. If we have 1 cell, then 2, then 4 and then 8 and so on, until we get to those 10 million. If we plot that, it seems that there is no increase in the first hours. That is why microbiologists often use a logarithmic scale. If you plot the same results on a logarithmic scale, you will see that we start at a certain level and it increases linearly. We see here also the equations. N, at a certain time, equals our initial level multiplied by 2 to the power n, where n is the number of generations. The number of generations is the time divided by the generation time. This curve increases exponentially. Therefore, we plot this logarithmically. And if we plot it logarithmically, we get as equation the logarithm of the number of cells equals, the logarithm of the number of cells at time zero, plus the logarithm of 2 divided by the generation time, multiplied by the time. This is a straight line describing the microbial growth. These graphs are made with an initial level of 5 CFU and a generation time of twenty minutes. This is good to try yourself in Excel, to see if you can reproduce this type of curves. {PAUSE} [CLICK]\nMicrobiologists have two ways of presenting these growth curves and you could compare that a little bit with religions. Some of the people will work always with a logarithm of ten scale. And other people will work with the natural logarithm scale. We can describe microorganism growth by the 10-logarithm. In that case we see that we go from 10 to the zeroth, for instance, to 10 to the 7th. And the growth rate, k in this case, is the logarithm of 2 divided by the generation time. You can see here the equation describing this in green. This is, you could say, one religion. The other religion is people that say, we have to make use of the natural logarithm. The natural logarithm has a little bit of a different scale, in the case we plot the same data. The slope of this line is now the specific growth rate mu. And that is the natural logarithm of 2 divided by the generation time, the blue equation. On the left it?s the 10-logarithm and on the right it?s the natural logarithm. The equation is exactly the same as for the 10-logarithm. However, the scale is different. Therefore, the slope, which is on the left k, and the slope on the right which is mu, are different. They differ by a factor 2.3. This is relevant, because there is a difference between the two. I do not specifically have a preference for one of these two religions. You have to know that they both exist. And you have to carefully look when you read scientific articles, or when you see experimental results, which of the two has been used. [CLICK]\nTherefore, pay attention to the units and the formulas. Here we see the graph of the logarithm of N as function of time, that we have seen before in this lecture. You can look back and see that I put there the exponential phase and I did write k as the slope. The 10-logarithme is used, this is not the specific growth rate, but it is the growth rate in log per hour, and not in natural logarithm per hour. [CLICK]\nGrowth kinetics is the study of the increase of the cell number as function of time. We want to know all kind of factors that influence this growth rate. We want to investigate the kinetics. In this case we assume that a microorganism is already well adapted to a food product and that the lag time is zero. And then we have as equation for our growth, the logarithm of the number of organisms is the initial level, plus the specific growth rate multiplied by the time. This equation can help us to describe the shelf life of a food product, because if we know the level where the microorganism will spoil the food product, if we know the initial contaminants, we can calculate the time that the product will have as shelf life, if we know our specific growth rate. And that we can determine by rearranging this equation. The shelf life equals the logarithm of N(t) minus the logarithm of N(0), divided by the specific growth rate. Such an equation can help us to determine the shelf life, but it gives us also tools to think about how can we improve the shelf life. An equation is not something magic, but it can really help us to do something. That is now my question; \"\"How can we make the shelf life longer?\"\" {PAUSE}\nThat we can do by either increase what is above the line or we can decrease what is below the line. So, we can either increase the numerator or decrease the denominator. We can increase the numerator by, for instance, decreasing the initial level. In that way we can make the numerator number bigger, and then we can get a longer shelf life. By better hygiene, we can decrease the initial contamination and we can have, of course, a longer shelf life. Another way is to decrease the denominator. By doing that, it means that we decrease the growth rate. If we get slower growth, also we can increase the shelf life. [CLICK]\nWe can determine different growth scenarios. For this we are going to look at an example, where we have an initial level of 1000 cells per milliliter, we have no lag phase, a generation time of 18 minutes, and we assume that the food product is spoiled at 10 to the 7th cells per milliliter. Then my second question is: \"\"What has now more effect on the maximum storage time?\"\" We can either work on the initial level, assuming that we reduce the level from 1000 cells, with 99%, so we have largely improved our hygiene, to 10 cells per milliliter. Or would the shelf life be longer if we have a doubled generation time? So not 18 minutes, but 36 minutes. Which of the two will have the biggest effect on the shelf life? Of course it is difficult, by only getting this information, to determine what the response to this question is. You will really have to calculate that before we look at response on the next slide. {PAUSE} \n[CLICK]\nWe have here in black our limit, 10 to the 7th cells, then the food product is spoiled. We have our baseline condition, where we start at 10 to the 3rd bacteria per milliliter. On a log scale that is then 3. And we have a generation time of 18 minutes. Then we can calculate that we reach the spoilage level after 4 hours, the blue line. If we have our first scenario, where we diminish the initial number by 99% to 10, we go down 2 log. We have, of course, the same generation time, so the slope is the same. And then we will reach our spoilage level after 6 hours, the orange line. That is scenario 1. The second scenario, we have the same initial level, but we have a specific growth rate which is lower or a generation time which is longer. The slope of the line is halved and we have a generation time, not of 18 minutes, but of 36 minutes. Then we get the green dashed line and we get a shelf life of 8 hours. The response to the question is, that by decreasing the growth rate, or increasing the generation time, in this case, we get a longer shelf life. [CLICK] Now you can also see the equations to calculate the shelf lives. Many possibilities exist with log or ln, but you have to be consistent, and also pay very good attention to the units. The outcome needs to be an interpretable number and 8 days is 1000 times better interpretable than 478.3576 minutes.[CLICK]\nThis growth rate is an important factor to determine the shelf life. Fortunately, there are many ways to reduce that growth rate. And that are all tools that as food technologists we do have, to improve the shelf life. The factors that we can investigate have different sources. There are intrinsic factors that influence the specific growth rate. Those intrinsic factors are the physico-chemical properties of the food. That are, for instance, the presence of nutrients, the pH, the water activity and the preservatives that are present. That are all characteristics of the food product. But, not only the food product characteristics itself do influence the specific growth rate, [CLICK] also the environment of the food product, the extrinsic factors, do have an influence on the growth of the microorganisms. That are, for instance, the temperature, the relative humidity and the gas composition around the food product. Those are not the characteristics of the food product itself, but that is how we store our food product. That is the second group of factors that influence the growth rate. The third group [CLICK] are the implicit factors. That are the properties specifically of the microorganism. For instance, its maximum specific growth rate, interactions between microorganisms, or succession in time of different groups of microorganisms. So, we have the characteristics of the food product, the characteristics of the environment and the characteristics of the microorganisms. The fourth one is ourselves, the humans that are processing the food or ourselves as consumer in our kitchen. [CLICK] We are processing, and by doing that we change the food, the environment and the microorganism. We do processing, for instance, to preserve the food we pasteurize the food, we irradiate the food, or we add salt to the food. And we do all kinds of other processing to get our desired products. For instance, we slice or pack the food product. This is the human actions that we do either in the food industry or as consumer at home. [CLICK]\nTo summarize\nThe shelf life of a food product is important to optimize. This shelf life is determined by the initial contamination, but even more largely by the growth rate of the microorganism. And the growth rate of the microorganism, we can influence with a huge number of factors. That gives us all kind of tools to work on the shelf life of a food.\n\n\"\t\n",

                "text": "This lecture will be about sources of contamination and describes different types of microorganisms and their contamination routes. [click]\nMicroorganisms are organisms on the micrometer scale. And a micrometer is one thousandth of a millimeter, so that's very small. Therefore, we also need a microscope to make microorganisms visible. We will discuss bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites. [click]\nBacteria have the size of about one micrometer and they are sometimes in a round shape, which is called a coc or in plural cocci. Sometimes they do live in groups of two and then they are called a duplo coc. Some types of microorganisms do live in strains of these different cocci and they are called streptococci. In certain cases, they live in grapelike structures. Then they are called a staphylococ. Not all microorganisms are round, some of them have a rod shape. Then they are longer than they are wide. These rods sometimes also have flagella that are some sort of tails. Microorganisms use these sometimes to move, and, in certain cases, to attach to a surface. Some of these rods also have an endospore in them and then they can turn into spores. Spores are survival capsules that can survive severe conditions. Apart from these cocci and rods, there are also other shapes of microorganisms, like vibrios and spirilli. Certain microorganisms are of bigger size and that are, for instance, yeasts. [click]\nYeasts are about ten times bigger than bacteria and they have a size of ten micrometers. Yeasts do often grow by budding. They get a daughter cell, which is at the beginning smaller and then in time is growing. At a certain moment it gets the same size and then the two cells do separate, and the organisms remain as unicellular microorganisms. [click]\nMolds, on the other hand, do grow as multicellular organisms. They have the same cell size of about ten micrometers. But with a lot of cells together, they grow in big structures. These structures can then even become visible. On bread you can really see the filamentous molds being present. [click]\nViruses, on the other hand are much smaller than bacteria. They are about forty times smaller than cocci, and they have a size of about twenty-five nanometers. So, they are even too small to be seen with a light microscope. You will need an electron microscope to make them visible. Strictly speaking, viruses are no microorganisms, because they are no live. They need a host to multiple and they don't have their own metabolism. They make use of the metabolism of their host cell. They therefore cannot multiply in food products. They need a host cell, for instance, a plant, a human or an animal to multiply. However, they are a very major cause of foodborne disease. So, although maybe they are not defined as life, they are very relevant, because they can make us ill. [click]\nThe next group are the parasites. These are often larger organisms and even sometimes are not ?micro?-organisms anymore. Parasites are also organisms that can make us ill and are in certain cases transferred by foods. A large parasite that is not transferred by food is the ?tick? which has a size of about a millimeter. But much smaller parasites exist like toxoplasma which can also be transferred by food. [click]\nHere you see the approximate sizes of the various microorganisms and to give you an idea a hair would be about 100 micrometer, so ten times the size of a yeast cell or mould hyphae. [click]\nMicroorganisms are everywhere. In this picture you can see animals, fish, humans, and birds. So, living subjects that contain microorganisms in their intestines and on their skin. These organisms also eat. Animals eat animal feed. We, as human beings, eat products of animal origin and of plant origin. By that we or animals can get contaminated. Then after eating, we humans or animals produce faeces. Our faeces can go to the water, or the faeces of farm animals can go to the soil and in that manner to plants. Therefore, all these organisms can contaminate each other and we get complex contamination pathways. Apart from having already this difficult structure, you have also vermin and air that are important additional contamination routes of all these different places. Our environment is far from sterile and many exchanges exist. The contamination pathways are rather complex. That is relevant to realize, because that means that by doing simply one thing, generally, you cannot solve the contamination of food products. We have to look at it from different angles and look at all these contamination routes, to investigate and control all microbial contamination. [click]\nMicroorganisms are everywhere, but the hypothesis of Baas Becking says; \"\"Microorganisms are everywhere, but the environment selects\"\". That is the next step. Microorganisms are there, but they need a suitable environment to live in so to have an ecological niche. They need resources and nutrients to grow and the conditions around them need to be supporting their growth. For instance, the pH or the temperature needs to be such that the microorganism can grow. They need something to eat and their environment needs to be good for them to be able to grow. The typical flora of a certain environment, which can be a food product, the skin of an animal or the intestines, or water, the typical flora in such places, will often consist of the same type of microorganisms. Certain organisms will mainly be found, because these organisms have a competitive advantage in that niche. It finds suitable nutrients and the environment is such that it can very well grow. [click]\nTo summarize. Microorganisms can be everywhere and they will be everywhere, so there will be many different organisms that can possibly contaminate our foods. That is one angle. They can be there. A lot of them can be there, but it is the environment that selects. That will select which of the microorganisms will grow fastest, because it is the most suited to this specific environment that multiplies best. \n\"\t\n",

                "text": "This lecture will introduce spoilage, shelf life, the causes of spoilage and introduces sources of contamination. [click]\nSpoilage is a decrease of quality. A spoiled product is a product of which the perceived quality is not any more acceptable. [click]\nThe shelf life of a product is the time that that food remains of an acceptable quality, often presented as the best before date. This guarantees the quality attributes of the food product. [click]\nSpoilage of a food product can be the result of microbial spoilage. For instance, acidification of a food product or bad odor formation by microorganisms. But, there are also many other quality reactions, like mechanical spoilage of a food product: a product can be bruised or broken. If a food product is dropped, then there can be a bad quality due to the bruises that are produced. That is one example of a food spoilage process, but there can also be insects damage. When insects are within a fruit, the product does not look good anymore. There can also be chemical or enzymatic reactions. As an example, fat oxidation gives a rancid odor or browning can make a food product not looking good anymore. There can also be physical processes. For instance, fat segregation or drying of a food product. This orange is too much dried out, and therefore not looking good and not of a good taste anymore. Also, in certain cases, especially with fruits and vegetables, the physiology of the product can continue and the products can get over-ripe. So, all these different processes can spoil a food product, but an important one is microbial spoilage. [click]\nMicrobial spoilage mostly will be the result of the metabolic reactions that do occur due to microbial growth. They can produce off-odors, acids and in certain cases can produce slime in a food product. Sometimes it are even the microbes themselves that give visible deterioration of a food product, that is generally the result of growth of molds. [click]\nAs a rule of thumb: Microbial spoilage becomes noticeable at 10 to the 7th cells per gram of food or 10 to the 7th cells per milliliter of food. 10 to the 7th is ten million cells per gram of food product. So, huge amounts of microorganisms are needed to really notice these quality deterioration processes. And since those levels are so high, the shelf life of a product depends both on the initial contamination, how many microorganisms are present initially, but also the growth of the microorganism. Because, in order to reach those high levels of ten million cells per gram, definitely the microorganisms need to grow. [click]\nWhere are these microorganisms coming from? The initial contamination is coming from all kinds of sources. And food products are generally coming from animal or from plant sources. These animals have a skin and intestines, just like human beings. And on the skin and in the intestines, there are huge amounts of microorganisms. [click]\nSo, the animal sources of a food product are not sterile. Also plants are not sterile, and therefore neither our vegetables and fruits. These contaminants come from soil, [click] often manure is used in the production [click] and the products are irrigated with water, [click] which is also not a sterile source. Animals and plants already contain microorganisms and are therefore not sterile. [click] \nThen we are going to process these foods and we can have a secondary contamination. Again, in the food production we make use of water, [click] equipment, we have our slaughter processes, and we make use of knives [click] that can again contaminate our food products. There is also air around us with aerosols, which are very small water droplets, and there is dust. And microorganisms are attached to this dust and are present in these aerosols. In food production we also have people walking around, and touching and handling the food products. [click] With their hands, they can cause contamination. Also, by their hair, they can contaminate the food products, because also our hair is of course not sterile. Those people can cough, producing aerosols again. In certain cases, they can sneeze and with that they contaminate the environment or directly contaminate the food products. Apart from these people, there are also other creatures around like vermin, like mice and rats, [click] birds and insects. Of course we try to prevent these animals from being present in our food production environments or in our kitchen. But, just like in your kitchen, it can in certain cases happen that there are insects present. And even sometimes mice and rats. All these primary and secondary contaminations can result in an initial level of microorganisms being present. [click]\nIf they are present, they can grow and then reach the spoilage level. Microbial growth is often presented in a graph where we plot the logarithm of the number of organisms against time. If the microorganisms are contaminating the food products, they often have to adapt to that new environment and often start with a lag phase. [click] \nThey do not, yet, start to growth very quickly because they have to adapt to their environment. But then, if they are adapted, they can start to grow exponentially. [click] \nSo, on a log scale they increase linearly. And in that, they produce all kinds of metabolic products. At a certain moment they change their environment such that they themselves cannot grow very well anymore and they reach their stationary phase. [click]\nSometimes this deteriorates the food product so much that they even start to die off and reach their death phase. [click]\nHowever, the spoilage level of 10 to the 7th [click]\nis already largely before the stationary phase is reached. [click]\nTherefore, the maximum shelf life of a product is mainly determined by the lag phase of the organism, and by the exponential growth phase. If the organisms are already in the stationary phase and they don't like the food product anymore, humans definitely don't like the food product anymore. [click]\n\nTo summarize, food spoilage is the reaching of an unacceptable quality of our food products. There are many causes for this food spoilage. An important cause of food spoilage is microbial spoilage.\nFor microbial spoilage, we need high levels of organisms, so we need to have first an initial contamination, and secondly, the organisms need to be able to grow. So to prevent microbial spoilage we can prevent contamination, or we can prevent the growth. \n\"\t\n",

                "text": "My name is Marcel Zwietering and I am the chair holder of the laboratory of Food Microbiology at Wageningen University. Within the laboratory of Food Microbiology, we do investigate the behaviour of microorganisms in food. The behaviour of microorganisms in food, you could say has three dimensions. [CLICK] We have the good, the bad and the ugly. The good ones are microorganisms that are used for the fermentation of foods. And by fermentation we can increase the taste of food products, we can make them better digestible or sometimes improve their health aspects. But, on the other side we also have the bad microorganisms, organisms that can result in intoxications or in food infections. And that, of course, we want to prevent. The third type are the ugly microorganisms, the ones that do spoil our foods. They don't directly have a public health impact. However, they are important for economy, they are important for sustainability, and especially in regions where food security is also important, they are really important for life. So, we do investigate the behaviour of these microorganisms in all kind of different aspects. We look at them from, you could say, genotype to control. [CLICK] We do investigate these microorganisms in all kind of different aspects. We look at their growth behaviour, we look under the microscope, we look if they can grow on several substrates, we look at how they are inactivated with certain stresses, for instance, after cleaning or after heating. And if we see their characteristics, we try to relate that to their genomes, to the specific genes that they have. And if we are able to do so, we can also, based on the genome, try to predict what the phenotypic characteristics, what the behaviour of the bacteria will be. So, that is one side, to relate the genome to the characteristics of the organisms. [CLICK] But, then with the final ultimate goal to go to really control of food safety and quality. So, for instance, the control of a pathogenic microorganism like Listeria monocytogenes in the food product, or to the control of the optimal quality of a specific food product, like a cheese. So, in both cases, to make use of our knowledge in order to get to optimal safety or optimal quality. [CLICK] That brings me to the mission of our laboratory. Our mission is to generate and disseminate knowledge of food associated microbes to assure the quality and the safety of our food.",

Evaluation of public health interventions need specific attention and I will explain you why\n\n research in an academic setting is totally different from research in practice these pictures will illustrate the differences.\n\n Cultivating of a plant in a tissue up is not the same skill to fading a plant in open ground\n\n it is the same with research within and outside the academic setting conducting research outside the academic setting in practice implies two main differences\n\n there is a difference in content of the intervention a clinical trial is not the same as a public health intervention and there is a difference in context of the intervention act an experimental setting is not the real life sitting\n\n in a clinical trial you can study the effect of a directory meant and it's relatively easy to register read Adric is taken are not. An example of a public health intervention it's a sports program and there is much more variation in the performance of the sports program degeneration and intensity of the program can differ with also the guidance offered by the codes can differ and even when you try to standardize a public health intervention there are still some variation because it's a real life situation and you cannot control everything\n\n the other difference is the setting or context. And experimental set think Emmy compared with this close box all design elements like randomization pretest and protests can be included there is no room for biases like selection or his three\n\n real life said think Emmy compared with this open box not all design elements can be included and this leaves room for bias.\n\n Because of these differences evil or a sion in practice is complicated. As indicated in the paper of Greg. And therefore specific evaluation methods are needed reefer to turn the thieves to our city the randomised control trial\n\n these designs these alternative designs can be categorized in three groups the first group is even raising the zines with control group and randomization.\n\n The second group is evaluating the science with control group and the randomization. And the last group evaluation designs without control group and there are three different examples of that.\n\n You will learn more about these designs in this course\n\n in this clip I have explained to you about effect evaluation in academic setting compared to a real life setting and you have learned about three groups of evaluation the science to do this.",

                "text": "Different techniques to determine the number of microorganisms in a sample.  And it explains how to calculate and express the counts.  The easiest way to determine the number of microorganisms in food.  Is to place a sample directly under the microscope.  To stick me is a very useful.  With bacteria however.  The disadvantage is that you need to have at least one million bacteria or gram in your sample.  To see anything.  And it's not always easy to recognize the bacteria in between the elements of the foods such as fatty droplets and cell structures.  And you can see where a bacterium.  Is a life or not.  Let's ration of the tumble and the application of fluorescent Propes.  Improved to detection.  For example what are samples.  But in most cases bacteria.  Are examined by plate counting on a suitable plate.  This technique.  Starts by taking a sample.  And by mixing it orally.  We're still humans.  And then bring it on to and our plate.  Like this is a copy to thank you baited at a suitable temperature.  Of bacteria to grow.  And after a day or couple of days.  One can count the number of organisms that were in the original sample.  The problem however.  Might be that are far too many organisms in your sample.  Sample and milk you to be able to count them all on one plate.  Therefore we will make.  Dilutions decimal.  The notion so to say.  By mixing one volume.  After sample.  With nine time.  This volume of Bill you and then he went it off and P.P.S. peptone to your logical solution.  The primary dilution.  Is often made in a back.  And from this primary.  Dilution.  For the decimal.  Dilutions are made in chips to obtain a minus two.  Minus three minus who are up to sometimes.  Minus seven.  These doesn't all delusions are than chance.  Two and I got to grow the organisms on.  Basically dark two ways to do so.  The first way is poor plaiting first one mil of.  It's brought into an empty.  Sterile petri dish.  And then liquids are at a temperature of.  Approximately forty five degrees.  Is pork.  Until the sample and mix.  Gently solidifies.  And the organisms can start to grow any other arcana to flee.  One can use our plates that have already been prepared.  The sample is than brought on to the top of the other.  This is called.  Surface plating.  And again there are two ways to do so.  You may bring hundred Michaeli just on top of the other manually.  And then spread it around with a device nicknamed.  Hockey Stick.  Alternatively you may use a spiral.  Plating machine.  To automatically upright fifty my creators onto the other.  In those far Anstey organisms.  Grow on the stuff as this is in contrast to the previous slides where the organisms in the colonies developed.  India.  In all cases the plates have to be incubated at a temperature.  Suitable for the organism that you're after.  And after a certain amount of time to colonies need to be counted.  In order to establish the concentrations of cells in the original sample.  The concentration.  Depends on the number of colonies.  On the plate.  This number is abbreviated as and.  But it also depends on which dilution has been used.  The original The example.  What a minus two and minus seven are.  Even minus.  Ever.  And last but not least.  You need to take into account.  The volume of liquid that was brought onto the plate.  This can be one mil.  Fifty my critters are one hundred Michael eaters and the final result should be expressed as the logarithm of the number of Connie forming units per meal.  Let's look at an example.  We have made our mind is to the notion of the original my milk sample.  And we've played it.  A hundred my creator of this delusion.  On the surface.  Of an arc or plate.  And after two days of incubation.  There are two hundred colonies on his plate.  What was now the concentration in the original sample the milk.  We take a question from a bath and fill in an is two hundred companies paid.  The dilution.  Was that second.  Decimal that ocean.  Minus two.  So we fill in ten to the power.  Minus two.  In the formula in orange.  And the volume.  Brought on to the agora.  Was one hundred my creators.  As it is a surface plate.  Is now two hundred times.  One hundred times.  Ten.  It's two hundred thousand See if you program.  Original product.  But we do not write it down that way.  A common way.  Is to express it as like ten tell you which.  In this case.  Is five point two three blocks if you program.  And please note that a concentration is always expressed in two digits.  No more.  The type of our plates.  Will determine which organisms can grow.  That are nonselective media which basically.  Are a soup that allows a wide range of organisms to grow in.  And examples of nonselective media are paid got our brain heart infusion are high on the types are selected.  And grow.  Allow only one group of organisms to grow under plate.  Suppressed under non-target organisms.  Common examples of selective plates are French and are is a hard act to get at bacteria and.  Alloa.  For hysteria.  On top of being selective.  And medium can also be.  That means that we talk at organism.  Will.  For example.  Appear bright green or very dark.  While the other Flora.  Will Remain colonist color less.  This greatly helps in recognizing the correct group of bacteria.  All the microbiological media need to be carefully designed and should meet.  A number of Christiania.  In the first place.  They should be selective.  If that's their target.  Allowing to talk at organization while.  Inhibiting the competing competitive Flora.  Besides that.  It should be specific.  So you can see which is the target organism and which is not.  And in the circle.  It should be elective.  So that the charred organism can be seen.  Even in the presence of many.  Non-target often isn't.  And I said sample of such a place is a selective plate where hysteria is selective.  So very few bacteria.  Will grow on it.  Oldest area will be blue green.  And a pathogen list area monist a touch in US can be discriminated from our list areas basis.  By a higher level or rounding.  Surrounding the colony.  This plate is a very nice example of a selective.  Our appetite with this knowledge gap.  I hope to.  Hope to have shown you that food market requires a wide range of selective.  Non-selective.  And elective.  Culturing Lidia.  When applying these media.  A choice needs to be made between poor pledging and service plating the latter.  Can be done manually or.  With aspiring writer. ",

We do investigate the behavior of microorganisms in food. And the behavior of microorganisms in food. You could say. Has three dimensions. We have to good the bad. And the ugly. The good ones. Are microorganisms that are used for the fermentation of foods and. By fermentation we can increase the taste of food products. We can make them better digestible Or sometimes. Improve their health aspects. But on the other side you also have to bad. Microorganisms organisms that can result in intoxications or in food infections. And that of course. We want to prevent. And the third thing. The third type. Are the only microorganisms the ones that do spoil of foods that don't directly have a public health impact. However they are important for economy. They are important for sustainability and especially in regions for food security is also important they are really important for life. So we do investigate. The behavior of these microorganisms in all kinds of different aspects. We look at them from. You could say genotype to control. We do investigate these microorganisms in oakland of different aspects. We look at their growth behavior we look on the microscope. We look at. If they can grow on several substrate. We look how they are in active feted with certain stresses for us. For instance after cleaning or after heating and. If we see their characteristics. We try to relate that to their genomes to the specific genes that I do have. And if we are able to do so we can also based on the genome. Tried to predict what the. Phenotypic. Characteristics what the behavior of the bacteria will be. So that's one side to relate a genome to the. Characteristic of the organisms. But then with the final ultimate goal.

Which is genetically engineered to be enhanced in. Nutrients that are important for human beings. The main purpose is to provide. Pro victim in a corrupt annoyed that we've talked about earlier. And that is. Deficiency. Which is present in. Wide areas. In the world. Now right. Is a monochord. It belongs to the family of the poet CA and. As I said. The Latin name is a rice a T.V.. It produces a grain. Many other. Mana courts. Which is composed of a storage tissue. The End of. Which is surrounded by this low run. They are and they are to see killed and. This. In normal circumstances. Is relatively poor in. Victim in every pro they can and. Now the prevalence of problem in a deficiency. Over to man a deficiency. That we find across the world is in these regions. Throughout Asia Africa and South America. And that actually also links up grey well. With the major white production areas. So producing rife which is why are fortified. For. If a man I would be very good luck to use so that. Rice is grown. In the areas where provision in any way. Efficiency because. Now of course there are lots of other crops. Which produce a significant amount of. A victim and I. And more may argue well just carrots Well that is of course a possibility but. To persuade. Farmers across the world to eat lots of carrots. Is probably less of a good argument than to buy or afford to fly. And of course. Which they are traditionally used to. But it is interesting to see that leafy vegetables and carrots and potatoes produce a higher amount of carrots. Now. So why. RICE Well why since it's been cultivated for many tens hundreds. Tens of thousands of years. It is a.\n\nOne of three major food crops. Throughout the world and. Other plants. Are not really suitable for growing. In the regions where. Rice is grown.\n\nNow the production of. Probably command is quite a complex metabolic pathway. With lots of bands around. But there are a couple of a few enzymes. So right now there's not enough. And then zones. Which have to be engineered into the right. You know what or to make it. Produce. Per victim and I. Now the whole. Golden Rice. Story began actually many years ago. I was initiated by NGO partly because a now a retired scientist from Switzerland together with a buyer in Germany and. Their work. Was largely found. Funded by no.\n\nSuch a thing.\n\nTechnology is a company that. Provided money.\n\nOver time and I want. Now.\n\nI mean things like. I don't know. If you know how many MANY buy it eventually. So the goal of the project.\n\nI need is a clear and I think that's right.\n\nThank you very much.\"\n",

And we'll discuss whether this is a success story or one great big disaster. Now. Plants are grown in agriculture. On their own without any competition from other plants. And to eliminate these other plants that we call we. We can hold the field and. Eliminate the plants mechanically. All the more modern times. We have ply chemicals. To eliminate the weeds and these are called herbicides and there are two types of herbicide. Selective herbicides. Total herbicides the total herbicide will eliminate all plants. While they're at the non selective herbicides where they only eliminate the weeds. However developing. Selective herbicides. Is actually quite difficult. Just imagine. With the weed wild oats. These are two. So related plants. That it's really difficult. To eliminate the weed. Without affecting the crop plant. And indeed. In any case. Always a selective herbicide will damage your crop. So that can't be avoided. It's a breeding for. Herbicide resistance. Is of course. Also very difficult. Because these are not natural. Traits that are found in nature. So what's the solution. Well let's just think about the action of nonselective herbicides for a moment. Herbicides in general have to impact on a plant specific metabolic route. So for example they could target. Chloroplast metabolism. Chloroplast being a. Elusively. Present in plants. All they can target things like hormone pathways again. Many of these hormones are X.. Who saved. France think of oaks and. And your brother Cassidy. So nonselective herbicides. Should of course be safe. That means that they should be highly specific in the plants and nontoxic for other organisms and. They should have a rapid turnover in the soil and not stick around in the environment and. Not be washed out into the ground water. So. How can we make a plant. Resistant to harvest science. Well if they have decide. Targets. A vital plant function. How can we develop a resistance. Well we could ask them we said. Try to breed for them. But this is really really difficult. But possible.",

                "text": " Hello In this clip I'm going to explain you about the projects that you're going to do in this course. If you do your logy and. Public health policies and. You're going to work in a group. On your projects that you have already selected and the topic that you have already selected. And you're going to do actually two things One is you're going to do an analysis of the problem. In your projects. For example of the city. In adolescence. And secondly you're going to make a plan to address this problem. And in. Course one two three. You have already learned a lot about measures and study designs in descriptive in analytical epidemiology. And you're also learns about how to integrate all the evidence that you have selected. And in this group projects in their group assignments you're going to apply all these measures. And these ions. In on your own projects in practice. We have not repeated all this information again. In this course so if you want to know more about what is an R C T and. How am I going to apply that in my projects. Please take a look again at the information. In the previous courses. The group work. Is divided. In a number of tasks. So these are divided. Especially in week one two three. In week four and five. You don't have to do any new tasks. But you will have time to integrate feedback that you were received from me. As a moderator. I will explain later how that works in practice. So for example in week one. You're going to work on the. Needs Assessment step one. You're going to do. For example task one point one. Analyze rules. Of policy. Practice. And research. And in the last column you will see the chapters in the book that are relevant to be able to complete all the different. Asks. So if you take a look at the first US. There are different questions here. That you need to answer. And I advise you to take a look. Together as a group. At the different tasks and other different questions and see how you can divide. The tasks. Within your group. So for example. PERSON one is going to work on this part. And then another part. Person in a group. Is going to work on. What is the problem. Then you can get feedback on each other's work. And then finally come up with a final document. This is an example of how a group. Has put together all the information in a report. This is just a background. Piece. Just to give an analysis of the context. In a particular country. With information that is relevant to the project. And this is another example of projects where the determinants and Allison is the scribes. And as you see here. You are free to. Just describe the information in you or your reports you don't have to follow. A very strict outline. But make sure it has all the information that is ass. From you in the instructions. That you included in your report in a logic way and it is easy to read. This is also important to take into account. When you are going to start with writing a report. Because these are all the elements that have to be part of a report. And also how they will be assessed. So for example. Task one point two. Is about twenty five percent of the hallmarks of your report. Where is this part it's only five percent. So it's outlined there. What are the topics that we will look at when we are going to assess your reports and take a look at that before you start. Then how to work as a group. First of saying all the information that is more to the readings the clips. The self test. So that you know exactly what the consensus about. And then you're going to apply that. In your own projects. Here in the fight. Tasks. To feed back to each other and you can decide for yourself. How you're going to do it as how you're going to share documents. Of course I think that fruits you can use for the she's here to share your information and give feedback. To each other's work. But to me it's also fine if you use email or Dropbox or any other way that this. Yet. The best for you the best option for you. Then finally discuss with me. When you want to hand in your reports. And also when you would like to get. Get feedback from me. The initiative. Is with you as you have for you as a group. And these are some options which there are what you can do. You can submit. Concepts versions at the end of each week. Or use it made everything. At the end of week. Three. And then you will receive feedback in. Week or so discuss that also as a group and. Discuss with me. How you would like to do that. Then I will give feedback and you can finalize the report. Then why are you working in groups. In this course. Well of course. This course is about. If you give me your logy in public health practice. And in public of practice. You very often have to work in groups. So part of what you learn is how to discuss with each other and come to an agreement as a group. Of course. Group work can be very nice and. If the group composition is nice then. One plus one can be three. It's going to really have big benefits. But sometimes we I think we. Well know it. That's working in groups can also be challenging. For example. Someone has the feeling that he or she is doing all the work. And others have the feeling that they don't have anything to contribute to the group or. Because others are already doing everything. So what we're going to do. In this group work. Is that you're going to evaluate each other on the group process. So to what extent do you think yourself. And the other group members. Have contributed to the group work and. Your judgments and the judgments of your fellow group membership. Is giving you ten percent of the final mark. For this report. And I've made a form that you can complete. And you can complete that in week two. And in week five. And in. After Week two there of course you still have time to improve. And in week five you will get some kind of final assessment. Of yourself and also the other group members. For example you will give an evil ration of the its you and also my group members completes the work. In time. And you can assess that. By giving a one. Which is never to a four. Which is always. And uses rubric also to. Gifty if you are Asian. And these forms are available. On the export. So in this clip. I think explained to you about two group or if you're going to do. In this course. And you can read more about this settlement form but also the instructions. The outline for the report. It's all available. On blackboard. Well good luck and enjoy working in your groups. Thank you.

                "text": "Hello. Welcome sort of course. It immunology and. A public health policies I'm going to give you an introduction. But the course. Looks like an a little bit about the contents of the squash. It's like you see here. Public health it's about. A lot of different topics for example this boy asks himself. And I had risk of age if he ate. There's another lady she says How can I have a healthy pregnancy. And those are the questions that a part of public health practice. And in this course. We are going to look at what could be your role as an epidemiologist. To answer questions like these. In the previous two courses the three courses you have learned a lot of. Measures How to describe health. You have also learned quite a number of. Study designs. How to measure educations. Between health and. Risk factors. And in the third course. You have learned how to integrate all the different kinds of evidence. To come up with. Conclusions about relations between risk factors. And health. And to say something about health in general. In this course of course for. You're going to integrate some of this information. By applying that to your projects. You have already been put together in groups. And you have decided. About a topic for your project. And you're going to apply. These measures and study designs to this project. And it is clear. I will explain you further what are the learning outcomes. What I don't do any activities and also how will this course. Be assessed. And you can read more about this. In the study. Course guide. Which is available on blackboard. Well the learning outcomes. First is to understand. The working processes. In the public health. Star. Secondly how to conduct a needs assessment. You will learn how to support priority setting. How to provide information so that decisions can be made in public help. You will learn how to formulate aims and objectives and. You will learn how to construct a logic model. Then the learning activities. As I said before a group project is actually quite a big part of this course you're going to work. In your groups. On your own selected. Projects. And to be able to do that. Yet there are a lot of learning activities that you have to do before. You can do it so there's a lot of reading. There are clips. There are modules. To group discussions and. Self tests can help you to see whether you have understood. Information well. About the reading. There is a lot of reading. But I think it's quite easy to read the chapters. And what I've also done is to approach learning objectives very specific learning objectives for each chapter. So that you know exactly what you need to know from the chapter. So you don't need to know everything. Then the topics per week. If you can see in the first three weeks. All the different topics are addressed there's a lot of. The reading and the clips. But also the group work. And then in week four and five. You have time to work on your report. Because you have that in have to hand it in. At the end of week five. This is the book. All the chips are made available in the forest and in their feedback fruits. So you can read it there. And finally about the assessment for this course. There are two ways. To assess first is the. Report about your group projects. There's forty percent of the. Mark. And the other sixty percent is a multiple choice. Exam. And the exam is on twenty fifth of February and. In the self this. I've included quite a number of. Example questions that you can make and. Similar questions are also part of the multiple choice. Exam. And like every course so far. You need to have at least a five point five for each part. To pass the exam. So in this clip I've explained to you about the backgrounds of the course the outcomes. The activities and how the course will be assessed.",

                "text": "Welcome. In previous clips. We have learned the basics. Of the think any mechanisms of macromolecules. For the more. We have learned to sniff occurrence. Of interface phenomena. For the macro structure instability. Of dispersed food systems like emotions. In this clip. We are going to apply the knowledge acquired on these topics to better understand sources. We merely analyze two types of sources. Flower based and emotion based sources. We will see that the thinking the mechanism behind. Flower based souces. Response to decree theory and we describe for think any mechanisms. Of macromolecules in general. But also that the thinking. By starch. Can be different from that. Of other thinking us. If we use the French cuisine as a reference. We recognize. Sources. Think and buy flowers and others. Which I actually think emotions. Perhaps the names of these sources are not familiar to all of you. But you can find the preparation in common books on French cuisine. Or on the Internet. The source is. Spend your whole village there ambition Mel. I made by adding flour. To a liquid. In the milk or stock. The liquid. Becomes. Thicker. Because of the thickening functionality of the starch present in the flour. The source is all on there as they are now as and my units are just more of either melted butter or vegetable oil. In a liquid containing are met in compounds that in part of the taste of the source the first five sources of the slides. Are used who are and are consumed with meat or vegetables. You know as is probably known to all of you. It's a source used gold. When the source is made with flour. The thinking is that comes from starch. Starch is a poly produced by. Several plans to store energy. In the form of a glucose polymer implants. Starch stored in a form of granules. Containing bone the polymer. I mean lows and I mean affecting a meal or packed in forms in the granules where all the structures. Called Crystal lights. They have an almost. Crystalline structure. The ratio between the two polymers. Varies with the type of plant. Like Also the size of the starch granules. Native granules are not able to increase the disguised overflew it. To do this. They need to generate denies the phenomenon of gelatin ization. Requires the presence of water and heat. At temperatures below the melting point of the granule. Which is that about sixty seventy degrees in prison of water the starch rain will start as well. To absorb water. During this absorption. The I mean the pectin in the Crystal Light you. Loses its order structure. And the crystallise are broken. He did temperature is increased. The granules swell. Even more and at a certain point they fall apart. They disrupt this way. The molecules of emulous. And eventually also I mean look back to come into solution. And behave. As we described in general for macromolecules. When they are in a sufficient concentration. To interact with each other the skull city of the solution. Will Increase in this picture. You see the native starch runs of potato. This granules. Are quite large compared to those of other plants. And are quite oblong. In this picture. You also see a cross in the granules. This grass is called multis grass and is close by the by refrigerants of the granules. When observed on the polarized light. The light is didn't. Upon it by refrigerant material is split into two rays which take slightly different parts. The buy refrigerants can be observed. Even better in this color picture. This property. The rye from the semi crystalline structure of the granules. Related to the presence of the I mean are packed in Crystal lights. When the granules. Gelatin knife. These properties. Is lost because the crystallise are also disrupted and other picture. You can see the microstructure of a partly gelatin I start granule. The strings. On the surface of the grain you will consist of several molecules of any laws. Let you know out of the ground itself. The Gillette musician conditions vary with the type of starch. Things start your brain will from different plants have different ratios between acting and I mean those. In Also different sizes. Furthermore cross-link starch. Also called chemically modify starch. Also gelatin nice in a different way as compared to known cross. Link starch. Gosling starch granules. Have less that then this is to disrupt completely when heated. In this type of starch also less any lows. Litters out of the granule. Therefore the think new functionality of cross-link starch is more related to this wall and starch granules. Which can touch each other can interact with each other then to the individual polymer. Molecules which gumming solution of the gelatin ization. For flower based or starch based sources or the relation between. Molecules properties and thickening functionality we learned in previous clips. Also hold. Furthermore in this source's flour and starch. Can be substituted by other mom molecules. This can result in surprising. Changes of the tax. Serve the end product by using polymers. Different from starch. Also the sensitivity of the sauce to the activity of. Any lays. Presently saliva will change. Sources think and. We start becoming less and less think in the mouth. Since starch. Is idolized by lace in Sosa's. Think and. With other polymers. This does not happen. And the sows remains. Longer thick. As we learned in the clips on macromolecules thinking S. to do with the. Effectively filling. Of space. For example of the liquid in which a specific structure is the salt of dispersed. We have learnt that macromolecules are very good at this. Also motion droplets. Can think and liquid. In which they are dispersed. If they can get in touch with it to do with each other if again. Getting condom each other when making the emotion flow. The more emotion particles. Would be present in the available volume. The more in difference. The floor to floor would be observed. We need several parameters to correct arising emotion first of all. We need to know all of which material. The continuous phase consist in of which material the dispersed phase consists. Furthermore we need to know the value fraction of the dispersed face. Taken as an example an oily water emotion like millionaires. The more oil. Will be dispersed in the water face. The Think of the motion. It is also important to note the size of the most droplets at cost and value fraction. The smaller the particles. The higher the number of particles. And the total surface of the particles. As we know it from the law plus equation. The smaller annoy droplet. The stiffer it will be stiffer oil droplets. Will affect the. Dexter of the Molson in a different way as compared to less the problem. It is also important to know the properties of the missile fires. On the surface of the motion droplets like the structure and charge. To immersion droplets. With the same charge will repel each other with positive effects on stability. To emotion droplets. With different charges. We don't attract each other and. Aggregates will be formed. When mixing two emotions we study Lysis with different charges. The composition of the facts. Is important both for oil in water morsels and for watering or the motions. For example. When effects. Solid the room temperature. Is used to make an oily water I'm also. Crystals will protrude from the motion particles. And this will increase the possibility of. Aggregation between particles. Finally. Also the composition of the container phase is important. We know for example that the higher the risk goes into the continuous face. The lower. The creamy velocity of an emotional droplets. So the presence of polymers in the container face of an emulsion. Can be used to decrease creaming. But also to avoid contact between. Emotion droplets. Prevent in this way also coalescence. To make a Molson's different techniques and devices can be used when preparing the mulcher we basically need to put the sheer in a system. Containing the two phases to be a muscle fight this way the particles of the dispersed face will become smaller and smaller can be applied to the ingredients of an emotion different ways. Let's not imagining. To make a millionaires now kitchen. To do this. We start by mixing then greed and so we continue to face. Egg yolk. The Negara and ingredients needed to modify the taste like salt sugar and must. Then we had the oil Little by little. Steering or whisking. We can also do this with an electric meter by whistling a steering. The oil added to the container phase is split down in small droplets. The longer you waste. The smaller the droplets the droplets will become. If you continue to add or oil. You will see that a certain point. The viscosity of your emotions start to increase. This will typically occur. When you have added. Thirty five forty percent oil calculated on the volume fraction of the containers face. At this value fraction. There are so many particles in a continuous face that they can start to feel each other to touch each other and this interactions between emotion droplets are seen as an increase of discord to do of the system. If you exceed a certain value fraction of the dispersed face. The container face. Will not be sufficient anymore. To offer space. To the newly formed motion droplets. At this point. Facing version of the motion we look for for a million as. This happens. I will devalue a fraction off. Seventy five to eighty percent oil. Above this limit you would go from an oily water Molson. To a watery noisy motion. You will observe this phase inversion as a decrease of the viscosity of the motion. At the moment of phase inversion. You will not have enough water droplets in the oil. To thicken or to recover efface inversed my Inez you can add some water do system. And continue whisking. This way. You will induce a new phase inversion. And he will go back. You will go back to the source you wanted to prepare.\n",

                "text": "Well you have looking in the area of Epidemiology. You have people talking a lot about the relative risk of certain exposure. However the topic of this clip. Is to think about. When I heard the relative risk. Really exists whether it is a sort of constant or nature or not and the answer will be that it's not and. For that it's very important to understand what we mean that with the concept of background risk. So what is because risk. If you will to the population. The total mortality of all causes in the population you could distinguish in such a population. Those who are smokers. And those who are smokers. And fact you are looking at the effect the difference then between the risk. In the smokers and nonsmokers. That's the part of mortality. That is caused by smoking and. In the Rotman model of the. Sufficient courses. You could say OK we have. Effect or. A number of factors that cause. The risk. In nonsmokers. Are you one and you have a set of factors that. Together with smoking cause the risk. In the smokers. So. And the difference is the effect of to smoking. So we have a background risk with in fact. Is. In an epidemiological sense. The risk that you have in the population. That is an ex post. Non-smoking. In this case. And we expect that. What's happening in that population. Affects to all members of the population. And there is a. On top of that an extra risk. Due to the smoking. Well. If you would like to know how much of the cases of the disease is caused by smoking. Just look at the difference in the rates. Or a difference. Is this rate in small course first is the rate in nonsmokers. So you see here the numbers. And that's it. A certain result. It's a difference. But as you say in numbers. You could express that in a relative. Way. As a relative risk. And then you divide these two numbers on its order. And you get a different number of course. Where one is. Absence of association. So the rate. In the smokers in the nonsmokers. That is what we call the reference rate the rate in the. Reference category. So it's fairly crucial that we have the right. Reference category. Let's now look at the same population but now we look not at all cost much ality. But the law will look at the core. The mortality. Due to everything that has to do with smoking. Smoking related diseases. Well that means in fact that. In all causes. You exclude the causes that has to do with smoking. So that have much to do with smoking so you exclude those ones maybe it's a small part. Maybe it's a bigger part but here apparently it's a small part because it goes down a little bit. So again. That means now defeat have a different background risk. If you look at smoking the rate. Related Diseases only. However at the same time. The difference between smokers and nonsmokers in terms of risk. Is the same because we have only removed. Those cases that have nothing to do with smoking or the difference will be the same. There are extra risk due to smoking. Will be the same. So if we now translate. Of a look at the risk difference. We see there is difference. It's going to be the same. But a relative risk. Is a little bit increased in this case. Because these same difference. As we have here is now expressed relative to a lower back around risk. The relative risk increases. So what does it mean that if you have a lower background risk. You have a stronger. Relative risk even though your a difference in the is constant. So let's now. Make a step further. We all know lung cancer is a very strong. Risk factor. Effect of. Smoking cigarettes. But however if you look at the lung cancer. As an endpoint. Contribution of lung cancer. The total mortality is relatively. Very small the risk of lung cancer. In nonsmokers. Is present but very very low. In smokers. Is a higher risk of lung cancer. The difference is not that MC It's only certain to in this example. But. Because the background risk. In is very low in this population. You have in the reference category. Their relative risk. Will be very very much. So here you'll see a small difference in their risk their friends. But a very strong. Relative risk in this population some. So here you see this conclusion. In words. If you would have an other population. And you look at lung cancer in that population but this. Other population would have had a high background risk. May be due to ready ation that a number of lung cancer has caused. Because of radiation. Then there would be at lot of risk. And that to this population. Both. In those who are smoking. And in those who are most smoking. And that means that this small difference is still the same. But now relative to the background risk. Is only going to be fairly small the risk difference they would stay the same. But because of the higher break and risk. The relative risk becomes much lower. So our conclusion from these examples. Is clearly that relative risk is not a fact of nature. But. Depends on the background. Risk. In the population. So the background risk. That's what you really need to think. To consider is the risk. In those who are not exposed. You. Comparing the risk in the X. post. To the risk enormous power of your background. If the second disk is a real it is very low then you are more likely to pick up a relative risk because then they tend to be larger. And if the relative risk. And the relative risk. Therefore depends on the background risk. In the population.",

                "text": "Welcome in this clip we're going to compare the sensitivity. To instability phenomena of two appreciated. They were a food. They can be seen as complex. Food. Dispersed systems. With cream and milk foams used in several types of coffee beverages like approaching a. Two starts. We can recall the many stability phenomenon of dispersed food systems like emotions and forms these kinds of systems are never completely stable. Eventually they will be affected by stability phenomena if a separation. And destruction of the systems. Would occur. The phone can be considered to be stable. When the size of the air bubbles present in it does not change the function cream. When the air bubbles. Float to the upper part of developer volume the commute velocity. Can be calculated according to the stock's know. The velocity increases with Decides of the bubbles. The difference between. The density of the dispersed face and that of the continues face. And the creamy velocity decreases with increasing viscosity of the continuous face. For phones. The difference in their city between. Dispersed face and a continuous face cannot be controlled. So increasing the risk of the of the continuous face. Is a way of preventing creaming phones. A phone. Disproportionate. When the larger bubbles become larger at the expense of the smaller bubbles. Which at the end will disappear. Is a curse. Because of a difference in internal pressure between the two types of. Bubbles in this more bubbles. The internal pressure is higher. And as a consequence of the air in the continuous face it will also be higher. The air. In the small bubbles. Will tend to do so in this or other liquid. And will be taken up by the larger bubbles. With. Of coalescence. Went to bubbles. Merged to form a larger one. For this to occur. Contact between the bubbles is required. The communication of creaming disproportion ation and coalescence can lead to a complete disruption of a phone. Another is the ability phenomenon to which forms are sensitive. Drainage. This is the progressive decrease of the liquids. Between there are bubbles. In a cream form because of two phenomena. The first one is gravity. Since the fluid between the bubbles is heavier than air. It will tend to move through the bubbles. To the bottom of the phone. The other one is could be the resection. Within the M L of the phones. Because of the difference in pressure. Between the inside and the outside of the bubbles. Imagine a cream foam in which the bubbles are deformed to a political structure. Because of the vicinity of other bubbles. Consider now. The point at which the three bubbles starch other. Which is gold the node of the plateau border of the phone. The pressure at the point. Q. will be equal to the pressure inside the bubbles. Because at this point. The bubbles are not curved. Nevertheless. At point B. The pressure is lower than inside the bubbles. This is this point. A curvature difference is present. This means that the pressure at Q. is either then it be. The fluid. Between the Lamell of the foam. Would be sucked. From Q two P.. When I arrived at P.. This fluid will drain. Because of gravity. In the direction perpendicular to the section of the drawing. Let's now introduce some basic a lot of the structures present the milk mill can be defined as a dispersion. Or an emulsion. Depending on temperature of particles. In a coal oil dispersion of protein. Aggregates decays in my cells in a solution of Solt sugars and. Smaller global approach things the way proteins. The Fed particles. Consist mainly of. Triglycerides. And the colloidal structures. With the largest size. Enormous United's milk and their size can go from one micro meter. To five or even more my commuter's the Ghezzi myself are egret gates of individual proteins called Case infractions infractions are proteins without a well defined secondary structure. And aggregates with each other because of other phobic interactions and calcium bridges between first with groups. Present on them you know acid Serin. They have as modest size compared to Fed globules. Around one hundred two hundred nanometer. The global approach things present a solution in a way called Way proteins are one. Tend not to be the large part of them of the right directly from the filtration of the blood of the cow in the cells of the other because the structure of milk as a large impact on the stability of dispersed foods. Prepare with it. To make. Whipped cream. The fetid milk is concentrated to. The first obtain a cream. Full milk as if it going to vary between three or four percent. Cream for whipping. As at least a thirty five percent fat. And this going to need is very important to update a stable. With cream. To make an optimal whipped cream. Cream should be cold and should not be organized. A margin ization is applied to reduce the size of the federal appeals to prevent creaming. As a result of omission ization. The feds globules. Are also coated with a thick layer of protein mainly case in my thoughts. Fed globules. And Casey muscles are produced in the cells. Present at the interior of a complicated system of vessels in the other of the car. When the Fed Global's leave the cell in which they are produced. They are coated with a membrane similar to the members of the cell itself. Or region is ation this is up to this membrane. That is substituted by layer of protein. The Milford globule membrane consists mainly of a double layer of. Forcefully pits. And which enzymes. Improve things so different natures are also present. So a milk fets globule can be seen as a sphere. Of triglycerides. Coated with a forcefully but the membrane. This main body is very thin. It measures. Eight to ten one a metre in thickness. The triglycerides can position. Of the Fed globules. Is such that when the milk is secreted by the Cow The fact is liquid. When the milk is cool down to let's say four degrees centigrade. The triglycerides crystallise and the milk fed to become solid the crystals formed this way can prove through to through the forceful it's membrane. To prepare forms like a whipped cream and mere forms different techniques can be used. They can be made by mechanical education. With a beater. Or a milk frother. But they can also be made by. Rating the liquid with a guess. For example nitrous oxide. At relatively high pressure. This is done. When the siphon is used to make a phone. At high pressure the solidity of the guests increases and more gas gets solved in the liquid than at most that atmospheric pressure. By opening the nozzle of the siphon. The liquid is pushed out of it and goes from a high pressure to atmospheric pressure. As a consequence the suitability of the guess. Suddenly decreases. And a large part of the guess is released in the form of tiny bubbles. Super separation is used to ready to use whipped cream in a can for example. Let's now imagine. To make whipped cream and milk forms. Just by whipping. As we have already said. To prepare whipped cream. And non-image an iced cold cream should be used as you start whipping or bubbles are incorporated in the liquid by mechanical force by whipping. The bubbles are also made smaller and smaller. The Incorporated. Air. The corporate air bubbles are the begin to stabilize by surface at the components present the milk. Above all products. If you continue whipping more and more air is incorporated and more and more liquid is employed to coat the form bubbles. For Cream about thirty percent of the volume of the product is occupied by. Fed globules these globules. Because of their relatively hydrophilic. Surface properties. Due to the presence of forcefully piss on the membrane. Are sort of the air water in the face of the air bubbles. At the certain volume fraction of the air. The Globe bills are entrapped between the air bubbles. And form a kind of network. A kind of skeleton supporting the air bubbles in this network. The Fed globules are part of the coalition because of the merging between. Crystals for three from the facility to membrane. If the cream. Would not be cold. No crystals. Would prefer to from the surface of the felt globules. And no partial coalescence among globs would occur. Also mention ization. Would impair coalescence. As said would you nice Fettes. When I said globules are covered by thick layer proteins. Medication misers. And there's a consequence. When using. Cream to prepare whipped cream. Triglycerides Crystal. Cannot Mirch. Cannot go less with each other because they cannot get encounter with each other different nation. The formation of a network of Fed globules described just now is not present in many forms. In these pictures. You can see just sort of the emotion droplets of the model cream. On the surface. Of air bubbles incorporated into the liquid. In the picture the top left most and droplets are visible in the subsequent pictures you can see the gradual. Coating of air bubbles by the most and droplets. In these other pictures. You can see the microscopic structure of the Fed globules network in a whipped cream. Prepare from creams treated under different conditions. And a different moments of the whipping. The large circle structure of the air bubbles. And the material around them. Are the federal lobbyist partly coalesced. In this lie that the higher magnification. The individual Fed globules in the Fed globalist network can also be recognized in this drawing. You can see a simplified scheme of a network of particle lest Fed globules. Surrounding air bubbles in whipped cream. The consequence of the difference in microstructure between whipped cream. And milk foam. Is a completely different. Resistance against its ability to phenomena. The presence of a federal lobbyist network. Protects whipped cream. Against this proportion ation and coalescence. More overt the presence of a global scene cream. Protect against coalesces. Also during whipping. As a consequence for cream it is easier to feel. Developable liquid volume. With air bubbles. And whipped cream. The volume. Available for the operation of air is completely filled. As a consequence no creaming. And drainage would be observed in whipped cream in milk at this much more difficult to feel. Old available volume. Therefore drainage and creamy will be more likely to occur. In addition. The absence of a network effect will obviously mean forms. Will result in a higher sensitivity against a disproportionate call essence.\n",

                "text": "I am so beat us to damn a move to an Al talk today about for liberty issues in covert studies. There are three major threats to Philip ity which I'll explain in the next light. But there are two types of alluded to this internal facility. And there's. External for the ditty. Internal fellated T. is that you are measuring in your core study what you intend to measure. And that this is free of bias and confounding. External facility is how representative fish your sample can you extrapolate your results. To a broader population. So that's also called generalized ability. The three major threats to Philippa T. internal for liberty are selection bias information bias and confounding. Selection bias is. Error due to systematic differences in correctness ticks between those who are selected or maintained in the study. And those who are not. And you could basically also do. In a core study make a baseline table. Of characteristics of those who are falling out of the study and those are included to see if there are differences in dose correct or mystics. To Judge Dredd and that would affect your exposure outcome or nation ship. And during the follow up if there's a long follow up there's also a chance of loss to follow a bias. And that can occur. If there's differences in a complete mess of fall of between those who were exposed. And those are not exposed. This figure nicely illustrates a core study from the beginning. To it's the end. And let's say we have a thousand people initially. And we lose a couple of people and also some people get the disease outcome. We have nine eight nine people at the end of the period. Then if you look in the. Expos and. Unexposed group. There are more. Our losses. In the Expos group. Than in the. Unexposed group and. If that's the case it could affect your exposure outcome relationship and you get lost the follow up bias. And example also to illustrate the last to fall of a bias. Is this example of oral contraceptive use and Trumbo ambled is a disease. And you can see that. The relative risk is estimated on the basis of of these two by two table that's two. And if you look at the bottom. Two by two table you see that there are four thousand people in each group last a full of it. But the cases are differentially last to follow up there are more cases lost in pill user group. Than in the known pill user group. And now the relative risk. Is one. So basically this story it's the real or true Association of two because you have selective losses the follow ups and then you will not. You will. Underestimate the association between people use and from what I am of this information bias or recall bias. Is when the data collection. On the outcome is not the same for expos and unexposed. For example fetter and. Who served in Vietnam which is good. Which is the exposure in this study. If they self reported more medical conditions than those who did not serve in Vietnam. Your relative risk would be different. And if you do more detailed measurements and find out actually. The differences are not that big then. Actually there is this information bias. Because those people who served in Vietnam might remember more medical conditions. Observer bias. Is also a type of information by a. Where the observer or investigator. Can actually. Actually knows the status of the Expos and or the unexposed. For example the yellow fingers they can see these people are at high risk of cancer. And that can then influence the way they diagnosed study outcome if. If that's cancer or something related to the exposure. Confounding is nicely illustrated by the triangle. There should be a relationship between the exposure and a co-founder and a co-founder and the outcome. And it distorts the relationship between the exposure and outcome. So how can you you may come founding. Visible. It's by doing. Stratified analysis and pull these stratified Stratham specific estimates. And you always compared to pooled Stretton specific estimate. To the cruet effect estimate and see if there are large differences in those relative risks. Then you would have to present the. Adjusted or the pool stratum specific estimates. Because there is confounding. So in this example also alcohol and lung cancer. The group can be stratified in a smoker screw very you look at alcohol lung cancer in a smokers group. And a non smoking group. And if those full. Stratum specific. As the Mets between alcohol and on cancer. Are very different from alcohol lung cancer by itself. You would show the food stratum specific estimates. Generalized ability. Is To what extend the study results can be reliably. Apply to a broader population. So you want your studies sample to be a representative so you need to think already of two who are you going to extrapolate your results. And for example does it fit in study is a cohort study which is. Carried out in. Elderly men. You can think of is that really. Would that be generalizable. To younger women for example. Well those are the kind of questions you have to think of when you do. Your exposure outcome relations. And in this clip. We discussed for liberty issues in gold studies. And also talked about. Generalized ability as illustrated by this picture. So think of how representative is your sample. And is your study free of biases.",

Prospect if or historical and. There are different synonyms for these types of course studies prospect of get me follow up study or. Longitudinal study historical. Can we reach respective course study or noncom current government study. And they are designed by the timing of the data collection relative to and investigated starts. This picture shows nicely. If they investigate the starts at the beginning. And you defied. On the base of the exposure people into. Obese group and their lead group. You followed them till they develop the disease let's say. Diabetes. And you count how many people have diabetes in the B.'s group. Compared to delete group. So because the investigators. Is at the beginning. And follows the people in time this is called a prospect if your study there to baseline data is. At the start of the study. The condition is that people don't have diabetes at the beginning. The historical goal or study. Uses records of exposures instead of baseline data. So now you can see the investigator is there. At the end. And looks back. With the arrow. Into. Chemicals for example are people exposed in the past the chemicals or or not but also this is the. Exposure is collected. Before the occurrence of the disease so let's say lung cancer is the disease. Even though they investigated looks back at the exposure in the past. You still follow these people until they. Phelim lung cancer. What is important to remember is that the assessment of the exposure. Precedes the outcome in both study design. So what is the essence of. Goward study. That's the time factor to follow a period. And you can see. Let's say all these circles is your cohort are individual people in their cohorts thirty. And as the time progresses. More M.P. more people become diseased as marked by direct outs. And if you look over the time what will happen. You can see that people who are exposed and unexposed. They or both fell of the disease. But for example if the exposure is smoking more people. The fell of the disease in the exposed group or. If the exposure would be healthy eating then less people. Would develop the disease. And what to do in the end. If you count the number of people with the disease among the expo's group. And you count the number of people who have the disease among the. Unexposed group so nephew Di Meola Jekyl terms this is called the incidence proportion or. Incidence rate among the exposed group. And the incidence proportion or incidence rate among the exposed group. You to fight these two incidents. Proportions or rates. And then you get the relative risk. I'll illustrate this with an Exxon pull. You can see in this example. Alcohol is the exposure. Cardiovascular disease. Is the outcome. And you can see in this classic two by two table how many people develop cardiovascular disease. Yes or no in Elko consumer group. And. How many. Developed cardiovascular disease. In a non alcoholic consumers group. And you can now. Calculate the incidence in both exposed and unexposed group. Which is given here to relative risk scale collated by the incidence in the Elk a whole group. The fied by the incidence in the non alcohol group and then the relative risk. Is point six. So it means. If you drink for example red wine in moderation. You could have a forty percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease than those people who don't drink alcohol. So in this clip. We have discussed. Different Types of the science. Of course studies prospect if and retrospective. And also how to calculate. Effect estimate and go or study the relative risk.",

This is a nice scheme of covert study design. Because it really illustrates the important factor of course study which is time. And you have to start with the population which is free of the disease at the beginning. And you select your study on the basis of exposure. So let's say. Exposed is smoking. And not expose It's not smoking. So that's the essential part of a covert study. And then you start following. The smokers and nonsmokers over time. And you count at the end how many people. Develop lung cancer and how many did not. In both groups. There are many synonyms for Gord's that is given at the bottom. It's also referred to as follow up study. Incidents that he learned to in a study and prospect of covert study. What is a cohort a cohort is a group of people who share a common correct their istic. It could be based on a geography. For example the Framingham Study which is a location in the United States. Or to why till study which is in London. You have to go over to based on occupation like the Nurses Health Study which is a famous one the British doctors study. You have codes the find on the base of birth like than. Nine hundred forty six. M.R.C. birth cohort study or generation. Are. And you have course the find on. Patients like the colon cancer study which is color rectal cancer patients. Already you're a die of Prosper. To study which is based on patients of. Type one diabetes. There are many other ways to say that go warts but these are just a few examples. Why is a covert study important. But it's important to study causes of disease. Etiological factors. But another purpose could be. To study prognostic factus then defy predictors of the disease. If you study causes of the disease so. Onset of new disease. Then the people in your cohorts have to be free of the disease at the beginning of your cohort. If you study. Prognostics. Factors. Then. The people at the beginning of your study. Are not free. Of the disease. And the picture illustrates nicely how tobacco smoking causes many different diseases and that's also found in epidemiology call study so where looking for causes of the disease. You do all sorts of measurements and because you have this fall over a period in a cohort study. You can already. Determine. In a really quality. Very high quality way how you're going to measure your exposure. And your covariance. And exposure could be in this example smoking. You could say OK I want to know who is smoking who's not but you could also say. Who is smoking. Currently. Who was smoking in the past. Who is not smoking. Or how many cigarettes were smoked. In terms of. Back years. You could take to do ration into a crowd of smoking. That are also it's of ways how you could. Operationalize smoking status. Go variants are important. Variables. Possibly related to the exposure and outcome and. In this example could be dietary factors. Physical activity blood pressure weight meshes. And you can think of all sorts of all our. Covariance. But you want to measure in a chord study. During a follow up you also want to measure the outcome the disease outcome. And in this example could be cardiovascular disease you want to have a self report a diagnosis or physicians diagnosis. You want to know the electrocardiogram results easy G. or. Cardio. Biomarkers olds to really define. Cardiovascular disease in an appropriate way. And not only the disease outcome should be measured repeatedly. Update also information on the exposure. And the covariance. In this clip. I explained to you the basic concepts of Goward study. And also why it is important to design a cohort study.",

Two segments on top of each other with rotational angles. We mean the angles. That can be obtained by rotating. A part of the chain. We respect to the previous part. But these two type of angles.

Where we want to stress. The configurations of these changes in solution. According to these model. Two segments of a chain. Can either overlap. For the more. Part of the chain. Can be crossing. Without energy or penalties. As you understand. This mortal describes and. Highly idealized type of polymer chain. In most real polymer. Bone angles. Can be fixed and. Rotation around the X. of the polymer. Can be limited by large sized groups. When the bone angles are fixed. But the segments considered eight freedom around the axis. We talk of a feeler dating chain and over freely rotating model. When there are Taishan. Around the segment axis is in the red by large side groups. We talk of a north pretty little dating chain. And over no freedom of data model is basically identical to the freezer dating tray model but now the rotation around the segment axis is in there by large side groups. To describe the limitation in bone angles. And the rotating angles. We use the permit to beat or. Which is determined by the cosine of the fixed bone angle and fixed rotating angle. To square root of beat that appears in the creation of The Root Mean Square and to end this tense. Beat that. As in general a value between zero and ninety degrees. And therefore the square root of is generally larger than one. And we see that the restrictions on the bonding all tend to increase the end to end. Distance. And of course. The radius of generation. As we have already said in other clips. Stiff polymers. Result in larger chords. By multiplying the length of a polymer segment of a polymer monomer for B. that we obtain the persistence length of. Effective. Segmenting this is the length. For which we can assume the polymer to be ridge it is like we assume the polymer to consist of less segments. As compared to the real number. The segments of which are defective seven lines consist. Can be considered as. One region segment. The persistent length pressed in number of segments within the region segment. Or in length units. For example in nanometers. By dividing the real number of segments of the polymer for bita. You obtain the number of affected segments. The number of segments of which the chain consist. When we assume a certain number of segments to be. Richard one. Imagine how to polymers with the same number of monomers but different is. Differing in stiffness. The more flexible polymer. Will have a smaller effect if them in length and persist in length. And the larger number of affected segments. The more rigid the polymer. The higher the persistent length. And the lower defect in number of segments. This is all summarized in the next table. In which polymers. With different degrees of stiffness are compared. You can see for example that any law is presently starch granules is more flexible than sundown. This means that if you make a solution of a nebulous sample an accent than sample with the same molecular weight. They say two hundred thousand dollars on you will need much less strengthened to obtain a certain discarded as compared to any loss. The reason for the flexibility of any loss is the absence of sides groups. In the chain and the absence of charges. The main chain. Look as being gram. Consist of men as monomers. On this chain. Sorry groups of lectors are present. And this groups. Result in imitation. Limitations for both the bone angles and the rotational angles. As a result of this polymer is most if that any loss. In the case of Caprica gene and the limitations of the bone the notational angles. Is given by the charges. Due to the sofa groups present on the chain consisting of ghettos monomers. This polymer is even stiffer the locus being on the side groups. Present of the main chain of content consist of a trice I can write with larger effects on the flexibility of the molecule as compared to get a full sized groups. Of locals being or in the case of broad things. The flexibility of the molecule. Depends on the type of amino acids present in the chain and of course of their charge. Be the casing one of the casing fractions present is in myself. Because of the type of amino acids in the chain. As for example no secondary structure. Bitter to global in. One of the global approach things. Present in way. Contains the contrary to intermolecular defied bonds which make already. The molecule quite reach it without a globally for the more it contains. Nine beater sheets. And one Alpha. Expert molecule. And this contributes even more. To its rigidity. So beat a casing as a flexible chain. And beat it out to global in as a regex chain. Does this mean that. Bit a lot of globally is a better think going to be the case. Actually No As a matter of fact. Global approach is our bet thickeners. If we do their chain is relatively rich it. This is because the molecule is not open. And cannot be seen as the rot. The molecule. Is curled up in a tight spherical structure as a consequence. Is radius of gyration is more. Truly smaller then. For a protein. Without secondary structure like beat or casing. The behavior of a real problem or chain. In solution. Is the result of interaction between chain segments into molecular interactions between different chains. And of course. This can be observed. Only in solutions with a relatively high concentrations. And of interactions between the polymer chain. And the solvent. The effect of salt in chain interactions. On the dimensions of the core the pants. On the affinity of the polymer for the solvent. If the affinity for the subject is higher than that for its own segments. Then the cause then to expand. And the size of the coil will increase. The chain segments. Prefer to be surrounded by the Southern molecules. And there's a result. The cost structure will take up. So the molecules in this case. We call the solvent a good solvents for the polymer. If the affinity of the sort that is lower than the affinity for its own. Chain segments. The coil will shrink. And the size of the coil will decrease in this case. The segments of the polymer. Prefer to be surrounded by other segments. As a result. The color will spell solvent. This type of solvent is called that solvent defect of a chain saw that interactions. On the dimensions of the coil can be incorporated in the calculations. Of the size of a coil. Through a linear Spencer. And suspension factor. Alpha. Which is a function of the number of segments of the polymer Alpha. Appears in the formula to calculate the root mean. Square and to end distance and. Results in an increase of these per meter for a good solvent. And a decrease of these per meter for the betterment. So in a good solvent accord to be larger and the best solvent. A call abysmal or. We call. Marginal solvent a solvent with no effect on the size of court in this case of A is equal to one. To visualize the effect of the solvent quality on the size of the call. We can calculate a divided ations in size. Going first from a margin of solvent to a good solvent. And then from a bad solvent. To a good solvent for appall him or we for example. Thousand seconds. For both the root. Mean Square and to end this tense. And the volume of the coil. The ratios. Of the sizes when changes solvent. Id and. All proportional to the number of segments of the polymer. For the Palmer. With thousand monomers. We find that the end to end this thing's going from a marginal to a good solvent will increase by a factor too. While the volume of the coil will increase by a factor. Eight. The end to end this thing's going from a bed to a good solvent. Will increase by a factor. Six. Why. The volume of the coil will increase by a factor two hundred fifty. So this Francis. Insolvent quality of a huge impact on the size of the call of a polymer. In the real polymer solutions. The polymer chains are also affected by each other so far we have considered diluted solutions or in other words. Solutions in which. One chain. Does not feel another chain in its neighbor it. As mentioned above. However. Chain chain interactions can also affect the core dimensions. When the solution is sufficiently concentrated in general we distinguish. Three concentration regimes in polymer solutions. A dilute regime. When the changed in of each other a semi dilute regime when the chains. Start to feed each other and a concentrated Regina when the chains are strongly affected by each other in closer to the solutions. The chain chain interactions. Use the complexion of the court for macro market macro molecular solutions the transition from dilute to semi dilute. A curse at very low concentrations already. We define. Psystar as a concentration of segments per unit of volume. Where the cores start to overlap. To feel each other this bar meter is used to discriminate. The different concentration regimes. If we assume that the changes. Start to overlap. When the ratio between the two the volume of the course in solution. And the volume of the solution is equal to one. Then we can calculate. Psystar. Based on the number of segments of the polymer and. The length of the segments. For the same polymer. Psystar will be lovin a good solvent. Than in the better old. As a matter of fact in a good solvent. The cold be larger. And the changes will fit each other earlier than in the betterment.\n",

                "text": "In this video clip. I'm going to teach you how to use. Figures and tables. In your scientific writing. Why do we use. Figures in tables. Why not just say everything we want to say with text. Well the primary purpose of a figure earth table is that a large amount of information or data. And condense it into a manageable format for our reader. We also use figures and tables to convince the reader. That our data our findings are valid. And we do this by showing high data quality. We also use figures and tables to draw the reader's attention to a particular finding So for example a relationship between some parameters. And we might also use figures or tables. To simplify. Complex findings. What are some of the types of tables that we might use in our scientific writing. Well here's an example of a table showing table one patient characteristics. And you can tell that it's a table. Because it has a series of rows. And it has columns. And this particular table at the bottom has footnotes. To explain some of the elements in the table. Close cousin of a table. Is something called a list. And here shows the diagnostic criteria for Autistic Spectrum Disorder from the D.S.M. for diagnostic criteria. And it's a list so it has a series of rows of information but it doesn't necessarily have any columns. And even though this is officially a list we call it a table. So what. Title of this is table to diagnostic criteria for autistic spectrum those who are moving away from tables over to graphs. We can have different types of graphs charts and plots Here's an example of a histogram. So this is Figure three. Percentage of high school graduates who earn credit in the selected science course. And they have a broken down by biology chemistry and physics. And they have a further broken down by year. You might also encounter a scatterplot. In scientific writing in a scatterplot is when you take a sample you measure two different things when this case they took muscle samples. And they measured. Like the. Said buffering. And they measured. Muscle carnosine. Then they plot of those two things against each other for each sample so each data point. Is an individual sample. In this case they fit the data to a line to see whether or not they correlate. You might also encounter a box plot. Here's an example of a box bus with somebody did five experiments where they measure the speed of light. And it's important to keep in mind that not all box plots are created equally. So you need to define for the reader what. Each component. In the box plot represents when this case we have a key. That tells us that this horizontal line represents the median of our dataset. We have an upper and lower box that represent the upper and lower court tile of the data set. And then we have whiskers. That Tell us the upper and lower values that were measured. You might also encounter something like a pipe chart so here's an example showing the local abuser's by drug type and it tells us that he Levan percent of people used heroin. Twelve percent used cannabis apparently cocaine is not as popular as it used to be. But thirty two percent are now using ketamine. Can also have something like a diagram and here's a diagram showing a process that you might use in a laboratory called face and that's fluorescence antibody cell extraction. You start out with some cells you fix them you add an antibody a secondary antibody and so forth. Similar to a diagram we've got something like a cartoon or a scheme. And this cartoon shows a pluripotent stem cell. Either going down the lymphoid so many edge where the my late cell lineage. You could have other types of figures so for example something like a map you might use. Or a picture or an image a photograph something like that. Very important once you've collected all your data. That you choose the most effective type of illustration should I use a table. Show use a graph. If a graph should be a bar graph of box five and so forth the nurse from conventions that you can use. When deciding what type of illustration to use. So if you have a series of precise values. Well you have a bunch of raw data. Maybe you conducted a survey or handed out a questionnaire. If you have a bunch of data that don't necessarily follow any particular pattern. You might choose a table or a list. If you show trends or interactions or relationships where you have a much of data that relate to a particular constant. If you want to emphasize an overall pattern or trend that you see emerging. You might choose a lying graph. If you want to emphasize differences between groups where you want to draw comparisons. You might choose a bar graph. Or a box thought. If you have a complex relationship that you want to illustrate. Or you want to show something happening either in space. Or in time. Or you want to maybe illustrate a pathway a process an interaction. You would use something like a diagram. Lastly if you want to compare and contrast. Different conditions. You might use something like a pipe chart. A bar chart. Or a box plot. The caption that goes with the figure. Need to tell the readers certain pieces of information so the things you need to code in your caption are. The dependent variable. So that's what you actually measure during your experiments and you would include units if necessary. For example maybe measured plant growth in millimeters. You also need to tell the reader your. Independent variables these are the things that you would just did. During your experiment. And again you need to include units if necessary. If there's any constant. During your experiment for example temperature. You made all of your measurements at eight o'clock in the morning your experiments will forty eight hours long. You need to tell the reader that. And the abbreviations that you have in your figure or in your table need to be defined in the caption. And then lastly you need to explain any statistical symbol So for example an asterisk. Would indicate P. less than point zero five. Something along those lines. Very very important when you're making your figures and you're making your tables that you let those figures. Do the talking for you. By that I mean. Try and avoid. Overly complicated. Keys symbols. Colors and so forth. Try to label as much as you can within the figure itself. Use relatively simple statistics. Make sure that everything is aligned properly. And finally use a large type font and use symbols that can be easily differentiated by the reader. So can an example so here's an example of an experiment where somebody took rats. And they measured. Paul withdrawal threshold and Paul draw latency. And they plotted it against time after they injected a compound. And you can see that this figure has two panels. Panel and panel B.. But the label for the panels are relatively small and difficult to see. Because they're the same font. As the rest of the figure. You also notice that they use relatively small similar symbols so it's very hard to see that that's a circle. And that's a square. In addition the axis labels are somewhat confusing so they say time course. Days post injection. One day three D. seventy and so forth. And then lastly it's not nicely aligned so it has sort of a sloppy appearance. So I took this figure. And it turned it into this figure. First thing I did was I took the panel labels. To them out of the graph. And the much bigger so it's easier now for the reader to tell that this is a. This is B.. I kept this as a close circle. And I made this one. An open square. Now you can see from the key that I've added. That a circle assailing square ten micrograms per kilogram. Triangle fifty micrograms for kilogram. I also cleaned up. The axis labels so this now says simply. Days post injection. One three seven ten fourteen. And I also align the fowls. Now that you've seen this clip hope you have a better idea of. When to choose a table or a figure what type of figure to use. And how to make it most effective. Thank you.",

                "text": "In the last clip in the scientific writing module. We're going to talk about how you can improve your communication. So that you can better reach your target audience. Sir Francis Darwin the son of famous Charles Darwin said that in science. The credit goes to the man who convinces the world. Not to the man to whom the idea first the cars and I think that this is a very powerful important lesson that we can draw from Darwin because basically what he's saying is. Coming up with an idea. Discovering something inventing something. Is not sufficient. If you can't convince the world. That that it's necessary. How do we approach. Language. Well everything that we write. Needs to be correct from a technical perspective. And here I'm talking about things like mechanics So for example grammar punctuation and spelling need to be spot on accurate. And also the idioms so the phrases that are common to your particular culture or language. And the cabbie that we do use. Need to be technically correct. In terms of writing and reaching our audience we can choose between. Explicit writing or explicit communication or. Implicit communication. An expletive or denotation. Is when you come right out and say something you state a fact. Two plus two is four. Implicit writing. Is when you. Connotes something where you drop hints. But don't come right out and say exactly what you mean for example you might say. Two plus two is. Well it's more than three a little bit less than five something like that and you're hoping that the reader will come up with the answer on their own. And good. Powerful scientific writing has a healthy. Combination of both. Explicit and implicit writing. Lastly everything that we write. Needs to be communicative. And by that I need. It needs to be readable by your reader. You need to be retainable so they need to remember it. And it needs to be credible. They need to believe it. How. We achieve all of this. Well it's very important that you hold your readers hand throughout the entire process. So everything that you write. Need to be read by the readers that they feel that you the writer. Are right there alongside them. Holding their hand and guiding them through the writing process. How do you do this where you make it as easy as possible for your reader to follow your paper. That's worth saying again you make it as easy as possible for the reader to follow your paper. That's because a confused reader. Is a lost reader. And that last reader could be something that you've applied for a job. Maybe you're applying for a Grand Prix of a proposal or your. Submitted a paper that's going to be graded. In terms of scientific writing. Repetition is a good thing we were all told in an early age. Don't repeat yourself. Grab a thesaurus use different words use different phrases mix it up. In scientific writing. That's actually going to count against you it's going to make it more difficult for your reader to follow you. In terms of effective writing parallel sentence structure is a good thing because it's familiar to your reader. And of course repetition is good. So what are some of the common readability problems that we often face. While trying to avoid passive writing you will talk a little bit more about that later. Avoid what we call a nominalization that's a big word which basically means when you take a verb. And turn it into a noun. So for example instead of saying the analysis of the data was performer using. Keep it simple and just say we analyze the data using. Trying avoid. Overly long sentences. Trying to avoid using too much wordiness a good. Effective sentence doesn't need to be longer than say fifteen words maximum. Also trying to avoid complex adjective and or noun constructions we call these clusters. Again they just make it difficult for the reader. To make it through your writing. In terms of effective communication in English. If you don't remember anything from the five. Clips that you've seen. I want you to remember this. The proper order for presenting information. In English is. Subject verb. Object. I mean repeat that subject for object. S. V. O.. Just keep that in mind so let's look at an example. A short presentation. Was made by the director of marketing. In this sentence the author place the object. The short presentation at the beginning of the sentence. Then they tell you the verb. And then they end with the subject. Who actually did. The action. And this is confusing for a lot of readers because we expect to be given information. Subject verb object. So instead let's switch this around and say the director of marketing. Gave a short presentation. Uses fewer words. Is much more direct. It's also important you use active crisp writing throughout your math right you're writing. Trying to avoid vague passive wording this. And let's turn it into more active precise wording. For example. It is recommended by the authors of the present study that. What you really mean. We recommend. The data that were obtained by Johnson were probably indicative of what you really mean. Johnson's data likely indicate that. The following results were obtained. Let's make it more active more crisp. We have tamed. The following results. It's also important that you use proper word choice select the words that you really mean. And that you be explicit. Rather than being vague or implicit So for example somebody might write this compound has been tested in rodents canines in primates. And the problem here is that rodents. Isn't necessarily specific there are lots of different kinds of rodents out there. So for example maybe you did your experiments in mice one kind of rodent. And somebody else wants to repeat your. In Retz. Another kind of rodent. Now mice and rats may seem very similar they look the same. They maybe taste the same. But. Biologically physiologically. They're strikingly different. So something that works in a mouse might not work in Iraq. Same is true for primates are all different kinds of primates other primates could mean. Chimpanzees. Gorillas. Maybe your mother in law. So you have to be very specific. Sentenced instead say. This compound has been tested in rats. Dogs and monkeys. Very important you never leave your reader wondering what you mean. Less than the most important thing that you can use in achieving good. Strong scientific communication. Is to maintain coherence. And for this we use what we call transitions. It's a transition words and they can also be phrases are used to link sentences and ideas. To make the story move along in a more logical fashion. And if you use transitions correctly. Your writing will be easier to understand. And the story itself will flow more smoothly. There are several different categories of transitions. And these can be just broken down into conjunctions. So for example words like and. Moreover. And so forth. We also have contrast. Transitions words like. However. Thought. Whereas and so forth. We also use transitions to indicate chronology so something happening through time than now. And next first. Subsequently. And so forth. We might want to illustrate something using a transition word. For example. E.G. and so forth. And we might want to emphasize something that we've just explained. Indeed. In fact less than we want to have some cause and effect transitions. Therefore. Consequently as a result of. And so forth. So I want to give you a few sentences that are actually a list of facts. And we're going to transform this into a smooth. With coherent story. Using transitions. Are global population has increased by three hundred percent in the past fifty years. Farmable land and resources have not kept up with the growing population. Food sources have become increasingly scarce. Global hunger and malnutrition have reached epidemic levels. New sources of food. Must be developed. Several research hours are investigating methods to grow crops under water. Current methods are not sufficient to meet demand. So this reads. Literally as a bullet list. Of a series of facts that don't necessarily seem connected in any way and we're going to turn this into a smooth. Story using transitions. Our global population has increased by three hundred percent in the past fifty years. However farmable land resources have not kept up with the growing population. As a result. Food sources have become increasingly scarce and global hunger and malnutrition. Have reached epidemic levels. To combat these problems. New sources of food must be developed. For example. So researchers are investigating methods to grow crops underwater. Unfortunately however. Current methods are not sufficient to meet demand so you can see now how we've taken a series of facts. And turn it into a story that's actually interesting to read and leave you with some top tips to keep in mind. Trying to avoid the excessive use of abbreviations. Or field specific jargon in jargon is terms that are five. That are known to you because you're in the field. But other people might not be familiar with it. Make sure you use your terminology consistently. Use the spelling and the grammar checks that are built into programs like Word. But make sure you use them wisely. Use the time in ERA saving features that are available in computers so for example for your references use and note. Good program. Make sure you use the Table of Contents wizard. To make sure that your table of contents in your report is accurate. It's very important you know your audience that's a person who's going to be reading it so you have to keep them in mind. And lastly please try to write about something that you enjoy. If you are passionate about what you're writing. That will come through. To the reader. Thank you very much for watching.",

                "text": "Welcome. In this clip. We're going to introduce some paramita used to describe the size of a palm accord. We will use this power meters to make some considerations on the thickening functionality of polymers. We have seen in the previous clip. That the rain will call is a polymer confirmation in which the monomers abune its are oriented randomly individual space. Even though they are bound to two other units. This way of looking at the Palmer presumes a certain flexibility of the chain. To simplify the configuration of a polymer we can imagine now. To replace the segments of the chain. Which can be seen assistive monomers. Units. By their board vectors. This vectors. Have a length. Equal to the size of the monomer and point. In the direction of the chemical bonds between their ability units in this light with the scheme. Of a flexible chain consisting of an monomers with both segment. Length. Equal to be. As a measure for the size of random coil. We use as a Colt's root means grammar and to end this to us. Which is given by the sum of the vectors. Used to simplify the polymer chain and is equal to the length of a segment be multiplied by the square root of the number of segments. This is equal to the distance between the two and segments of the chain. From this relation. We can derive. That the size of a polymer coil increases. With increasing the number of segments present in it. Another physical parameter used to indicate the size of a polymer is the can do lengths of the chain. Which is defined as the length of the chain. Measured along its backbone and is therefore. Equal to be multiplied by N.. You can immediately see that for a stiff polymer a ball in which the second. No rotate was spec to each other and that can be seen as a road. The Root Mean Square and to end this tense. Is equal to the can to length. This means that the stiff polymer. As a coral which is larger than the call of a flexible polymer. By number of times. Equal to the root Square. And because it is now a polymer consisting of. Ten thousand segments. Ten thousand different monomers. A coil of a stiff version of this polymer. Would be one hundred times larger than the coil of a flexible version of it. Another power meter used to describe the size of a problem of course is this so called The ridges of generation. This is the average distance between the center of mass of the coil and. Each joint. Each segment of the chain. Without demonstration. We stated the duration of generation is equal to the Root Mean Square into in distance divided by the square root of six. In order to visualize the effect of the size of the coil on the thickening functionality of a palm or we can calculate. Two different types of volume of it. And look at the relationship between them. As a measure of a volume of a polar molecule one can take the volume of the sphere that can be drawn around this core. This is easily calculated. With the former to calculate the volume of a sphere. By taking the radius of generation. As radius of the sphere. By inserting the formula to calculate the volume of a sphere. The formula. Of the ridge a soldier ration based on the Root Mean Square and to end this to us. We obtain a new formula that we can use. To calculate the volume of the coil. Starting from the length of a segment. And the number of segments of the polymer. On the other hand a bowler has also another type of volume. The one given by the sum of the volume. Of all individual segments in the molecule. This is the real volume of the polymer chain. Assuming be divided by two. To be the radius of one monomer. We can calculate this second type of. Polymer volume by calculating the volume of one monomer. And multiply and they obtain a value for the number of modernise. The ratio between the two types of volumes of the polymer. As the find here. Is a measure of how dense or another words. How dilutes a Palmach or less. The larger the number of segments in the palm or the less dense. The coral will be. This means that the coil of a longer polymer will fill a certain volume in a more efficient way. To use the significance of this ratio to better understand the thinking a function of a polymer. We can do now the full of in calculation. We can calculate the value fraction. Of course in a solution of polymer containing. Ten thousand monomer monomers. With a concentration of one percent. The value freshen of course. In a certain volume of the fluid is of course given by the number of course multiplied by the volume of one core. And divided by the variable value by elaborating this relation with a few simple mathematical steps. We obtain a formula to calculate the value fraction of the core is present in solution. Based exclusively on the number of moments of the corner. If you applied obtain formula to the case of The One Percent Solution of a problem or with ten thousand mourners. You will update that in this solution. The coils. Feel. Fifty four percent of the available space. If you can see the pole of a really large number of monomers. Let's say one hundred thousand. Then you will see that more than one hundred percent of the available space can be filled. This means that when one percent solution of this polymer is made the course cannot fully expand they are limited in their expansion. Such a system. With such a high value fraction of polymer Corps. Is the system thickened because only the water outside the course can easily flow. The water. Inside the coral. Can be considered as bound hooter. And the call is behave as a relative a list of particles. When the core is bouncing to each other they will change shape. And then humans between the molecules will occur. With an increase of the thickening functionality of the system.\n",

                "text": "Hello In this clip. I'm going to introduce you to an outline for a scientific report. So complete scientific report starts with a cover. So when I pick up your report the first thing that I should see is a cover on the front. And the cover should include the title of your report. And the author's name. And it should include a nice attractive picture. To draw the reader in when I open the cover page the next page I should see if the title page in the title page is kind of like the cover on steroids. So it's going to include. Again the title of the report. And the author's name. And it was include things like your registration number. The Course name course number. Fucking University things like that and the purpose of the title page. Is to give the reader the information that they need to know where this report goes. We need to the title page the next page should be the abstract page. And after that comes the table of contents. And all of this from the cover. To the table of contents is what we call the administrative or front matter. Part of the report. And the put these pages are numbered. With lowercase Roman numeral for example I I.I. I.I.I. and so forth. After the Table of Contents comes your numbered chapters. And most of the time your first chapter is going to be an introduction to chapter one introduction. And this will begin on. Arabic numeral page. One after the introduction comes chapter to chapter three chapter four and so forth. All the way into your final chapter. And most cases your final chapter is a discussion. You might give some conclusions. Recommendations advice. The main purpose of the last chapter is to give context. To the entire report. After your final chapter will come. References. And then you may or may not include append to Caesar and axes. And the references and Appendix these are what we call. Administrative. Back matter part of your report. There are some strategies you can use for a scientific report the most common one that you'll see. Is what we call the method based or M. read. Structure. And this is I am R eight D. which stands for introduction methods. Results. And discussion. Alternatively you might choose something more thematic. So for example you might want to talk about various aspects of a particular topic. But as parts of a topic. Where you might want to talk about groups or persons or groups of persons. Alternative you might want to enormous rate. A series of points. Another post you could take as chronological For example you might talk about the development of something. Beginning in the early eighteen hundreds. Moving through the one nine hundred. The twentieth century and so forth. Alternatively you might want to do something that's were geographical So for example you start out talking about. Populations in North Brabazon. And South Holland. And it's tracked and so forth. Lest you might want to take a more persuasive approach to your scientific report. For example if you're writing a policy paper and you want to convince people of something very important you understand how you can arrange your chapters. Subchapters sections and subsections. And nice logical order and when you're doing this you need to think always about the global order. And here think about a house. From the outside looking in as well as the internal order and here we're talking about the inside of your house. So for example you've got floors. Each floor has rooms. Each room has furniture and so forth. Then you going to choose a strategy that's logical for the reader to understand. And you're going to create chapters. And subchapters No we numbered. Chapter one. One point one one point two and so forth. We talked in the last clip about how a strong title. Can help the reader understand your report. And a strong tide is going to tell your reader what your area of work is what your report is about. So think about a title for example. Humidity increases the growth of avalanches. If you saw that tide and you didn't have any more information. You might think the report is all about the effect of moisture in the air. Causing snow to come down the side of a mountain. Let's say you get the report. And you look at it it turns out. It's actually. About humidity increases the growth of electron avalanches and electrical gas discharges are completely different than what you thought. So make sure your title is strong and it tells the reader exactly what your report is about in terms of the abstract. Abstract is where you're going to address the following question are you going to tell the reader. What does the report about. And you going to do this briefly. Without going into too much details. And a good abstract does not need to be longer than say two hundred fifty words. And you going to address this question. By doing the following First you're going to state the primary objectives. What did you study what did you investigate. And why then are you going to describe briefly. The methods that you use what did you do then you're going to summarize for the reader the most important results of your report. Of your results of your study. For example what did you discover. And then last are you going to state the main conclusions. And what they mean. And to whom. Your chapters are usually going to organized as such in rad. So the first chapters usually going to be your introduction. And you materials and methods. Your results. Followed by last the discussion and conclusions. At the end of your report you're going to include references and. In your report in the text itself we have what we call in text. Citations. And these can be done either using a numerical format so using numbers so you might say in a previous study. And then in parentheses a number one. Or you could use square brackets or you might use superscripted numbers like a superscripted one. Where you could choose a convention that uses names in dates. For example. In a previous study. In brackets. That are common I can use seven. In a previous study by Smith et al. One thousand nine hundred seven. If there's one author. You use that authors last name. And the date so for example Smith common one thousand nine hundred seventy two authors would be. Smith and Jones one thousand nine hundred seven. And if you have more than two authors usually use a Smith and Al. One thousand nine hundred seventy. At the end of Europe. You'll have a list of references we call this the reference list. And it's either in alphabetical. In this case based on the first author's last name. Or numerical. Inventory of. All of the references that you cited. Within your report. Your list of references has to be consistently formatted. And it needs to be accurate so if there's a citation. In the report itself. I need to be able to find it in the reference list. In the reference itself you're going to include. The author's last name or names and their initials. The year in which it was published. The journal or book title the volume number if it's a journal if it's a book and there's an edition you include that. And the page numbers that it's located on some. Optional things are things like the article title. Or the ISSUE NUMBER. Thank you very much for watching.",

                "text": "In this video clip. We're going to talk about how to achieve. Clear communication in scientific writing. So scientists are called upon to communicate in a variety of settings and contexts almost on a daily basis. And that communication could be in the form of written documents So for example reports. Articles proposals. Even web pages. Or could be an oral style of presentation for example at a conference. A lecture. A meeting or if you're presenting a poster. And all of these types of communications go to a different range of audiences. At one extreme. We've got. Audience members who are specific technical audience members. And those are people who are in your field. Know about the kind of work that you're doing. And they understand the language and the jargon that you're going to use. And usually about ten to fifteen percent of your audience is made up of this. Specific technical audience. In the middle of the lion's share of your audience is made up of what we call a general. Technical audience and that might be someone who has the same level of education as you. Maybe works in science but not in the same exact discipline. So they might be familiar with some of the terms that you use but certainly not with all of them. Then at the other end of the spectrum we've got what we call a or non-technical audience members. And those are people who are somewhat familiar with the topic. But don't know it in enough depth and so you have to somehow reach that audience member. By changing the way in which you communicate. And the challenge that all of us as scientists face. When we're trying to communicate is to put together a communication package that can be read and understood by all three categories. How does the writing process usually work well it usually starts by asking some goals. Or questions. Of the writer. For example as a writer. What do I know about this topic Am I really intimately familiar with it or my just learning about it for the first time. Secondly what is my purpose for writing. As a scientific writing and as with all kinds of writing that you're going to. Do in your career. If you don't know the purpose for why you're writing something you might as well not write it at all because it's never going to reach the audience. Then you have to ask who is. My intended audience. And how much do they know about this topic do they know more than I know. Do they less than are now. And should I worry about other readers might non intended audience. The short answer of course is yes. Next you have to ask well what structure is going to work best for this particular topic. And then of course you go about the actual writing phase itself. There's usually starts in step one. With the planning stage. And then once you've planned and come up with a basic outline you move on to Step two or you'll draft. And start building upon that outline in this where you come up with. Chapter one chapter two. What's going to go into Figure one what's going to go into Figure two. After you've drafted your report. You're going to move on to what I call the revising stage. And this is where you want to make a large global changes for example you might think you know. Chapter two really would be better off as Chapter one. Figure to should be changed and incorporated into Figure one. Large global changes. Then you move on to the final editing stage of the process. And here's where you make small micro revisions so for example you do a spell check. Grammar check. You'll make sure if you refer to figure five. That there is a figure five. You'll check all the references that kind of thing. The hardest thing for most scientific writers. Is knowing when to stop knowing when to click print. Printed out. And handed in. So what are some steps that you can take when you're preparing a paper or any kind of written report. Well the first thing you have to do of course is clarify or understand your aim. Purpose target. Why are you writing this report and what are you trying to achieve with it. For example are you trying to describe a process. Explain something. Instructor specify. Or you evaluating something that's already been explained before you making recommendations. You might be trying to persuade people to do something or not do something. Of course. Always have to consider your audience and everything that you write your audience is going to be made up of both your target group which is the audience for whom you're actually writing. And also your non target group. And when you're writing for your target group you're going to need to adjust the subject matter. The material that you use the examples. The jargon the vocabulary the length and so forth. To make sure that you. Kitsch or target group. Perfectly. The next step of course is you have to actually collect the information that's going to go into your report. And this can be made up of either. Literature search so you go to the library you go online and you collect information. And this is what we call second hand. Literature second hand data. And then you going to have maybe your own research maybe you put on some boots go out into the fields go out into the mud. Collect samples. Write it up in a notebook. This is what we call first hand data because you've collected it yourself. More often than not it's going to be a combination of these two. And the question you have to ask yourself at this stage is what information do I need to fulfill this communication task for this specific audience. In this context. And be sure that you avoid what we call the drip. Phenomenon data rich. Information pour a good. Effective report does not need to be overly complex doesn't have to be too thick. Trying not to over impress your reader. Moving on the next thing you'll usually do is to prepare an outline for the structure of the report and here's where you decide. OK what goes into which chapter welcomes into each sub chapter. How many figures do I need. Do I need tables how many. Then you go on to write a draft report. And then of course you revise edit. And check the final version. It's very important you have someone read it. Obviously it should be someone else other than you. Find someone offer them a nice reward like a cup of coffee. A beer and say Would you please read my report and give me some feedback on it. Also important. Use the spelling checks. Use the grammar check tools that are built in the software. Of course the most effective way to reach an audience is through us an effective title. And the title is extremely important my countrymen back in America. Fellow by the name of Michael alley at Penn State University says. The title is the single most important part of a scientific document. It tells the reader what the document. Is and if your title is inexact or unclear. A lot of people for whom you wrote. The document. Are never going to read it. And I'd like to go one step further and say. A lot of people that you didn't write it for may read it. Thank you very much for watching.",

                "text": "We all struggle with scientific writing. And knowing how to reach our target audience is something that doesn't come natural to most scientists. If the purpose of the scientific writing module is to help introduce you to some of the key elements. That can improve your scientific writing and help you reach your target audience. The scientific writing module itself consists of several elements were components. First I'm going to give you an introduction to scientific writing. After that we're going to go over some of the basics of clear communication in scientific writing. And it is one thing that I want you to take away from this course. It's that everything you do needs to be both simple and straightforward. So for example instead of saying. This plane has a high altitude. Operating capability. Just keep it simple and say This plane can fly at high altitude. Also going to help you make sure that everything that you write. Is both descriptive. And explanatory. Next we'll talk about some of the key parts that go into a good effective scientific report. Then we'll talk about some of the theory about tables and graphs. Specifically when to use them and how to use them. And then lastly we'll talk about some of the basics of affective English. I'll teach you some of the column pitfalls that new writers experience. And help you overcome them. At the end of the course you're going to write a final report that you'll submit for grading. And this report needs to include an abstract. That should be approximately two hundred fifty words. Than the main text of your report. Should be approximately twenty five hundred words. Your final report needs to include figures. Tables. References and we'll talk more about that in a later clip. Thank you very much for watching.",

                "text": "Welcome. Your con. Going to start a new course. And discourse. Be Called continue scores. And I am carrying to explain discourse to you in this clip. So we call it a continuous course because the duration of this course is two years and it starts your five forked over. And you follow these course. Beside the normal. Courses. So devil we call it continues. It's two usually long. You're going to work on that course. And this course. Accounts for fell of the city yes. And it consists of different parts. So we have the skills training. We have a project want a porch check too. So what does a scheduled. In the first year. So it start a fifth of October to be and offered curriculum. And we have the project won. And the skills training. And as you can see this edit indicates dead there interaction between. The skills training and a project. Because you can apply. Certain skills. In the project. Bircher Kwan is about. Intervention mapping. And you work in this project. In groups. We have several skills you're going to work room so you can work on information needs or see communication into action. Project planning and management scientific writing. A presentation skills and. Argumentation skills. And you can see these last two are angry that means that you only get in short introduction in the first year. And you really coing to work on the skills. In the second tier. So assignments related to the stop because it could be either an eventual assignment or. A group assignment. So what are you going to do in you two. So does. Then in that year do. Continue score start immediately. So if the fifth of September. And it's continues. And it's a. If you complete discourse. In the seventeenth of July. Project two is about writing a proposal. And you're also in this project you're working in groups. For the more we have the skills training and. You see to the same skills as. In you want. And as you can see. Informationally There she is in grade three that means you are not really working on that. In this second year. And again in the second year. These are the Simons related to these skills can be either new vidual Simon. Or a group assignment. So how is this course. Assessed. Fifty percent of the and. Mark is related to the skills training. The project one counts twenty five percent. And Mark. And project to also twenty five percent. And use you to have a five point five for each of these parts. To complete this continue scorched. So Howard is skills divided. You can see that. Thirteen percent of the and. Mark that communication interaction contribute thirteen percent would add Mark. As well as presentation skills and. Order for skills. Contribute. Six percent. Judy final. Mark. So we differentiate. Different roles in this course. We have the experts over to skills. Expert and a project expert. And the more raters the. Experts are really related to Condon so you can ask. Condit's related questions to these experts and they know a lot about accountants the. Emoter rate there is. Really. Sponsible for the process. Here you see the different rules and how you are killing to interact with each other the evil of the right of the King continues courses Rosalie. So she of you Bill York. Immigrate to for the. Complete two years. And you a student to interact with her. You are not going to interact immediately with the skills expert. But it's going through the. Immoral rater. And the skills. Experts will explain the skills in. Clips and. Have developed. The learning materials. So in the project you have your group as. The group the project is a croup assignment. And you can consult the project experts. So that means dead you should really be proactive. So if you have a question and you think well of really need so input. Then you can ask. The project expert. And we have several. Rules. Then and how to you to meet these project experts. You are also into acting with your email. Motivated because for example if you're working on the skill communication into action. You also work on a team building and. How you can go into work in a team. And of course therefore. It's very useful to use your. Croup experience. In this project. We have one exception to do. In the skill information leader see you have an difference. Emoter rater. And it's also to skills expert. So what are you going to do this week. So you are going to if you go to. You are. You will be introduced to the continuous course. So does this clip and for example also do a course. Cards. You will start a project one. You also get an introduction to. All skills and the. Order hall. You were all information literacy. If mation literacy skill. So in this clip. I explained it continues Corsi you. So I explain destruction of the course. The topics. How discourses accept. Assessed. The rules of the supervisors and. What you're going to do disobey. This week. Thank you for your attention.",

And I'm killing to give an introduction to discourse. So here you see an overview of the course or you are going to follow in the first year of this of learning program. And as you know. This is the second. Course. In this program. So we focus on several topics. The gentle introduction to a public health general issues relate to public health. You see that we also focus on the terminal and. Intake status and health. And to any focus on the general issues regarding the. Epidemiology epidemiological study decides. So you know what descriptive added them your logy is about. So in these studies you are going to effect a kid. So what is happening RW Could it is ease. Or when does this disease occur. And where did it over. In and little. Epidemiology. You are focusing on the. Courses. So why did. A disease happen. So on this board we focus in this course. So suppose you wanted to know where the red meat intake causes. Risk of Type two diabetes. So if you want to study dish you need a study design. So to first objective. Is related to the study design so what. Study designs are we using in analytical epidemiology. So we are learning more about these designs indeed or in this course. So if you have chosen your study design. And you have data about red meat intake in type two diabetes. You want to have a. Measured at. EXPRESS destroy relationship. So dinner for the seconds of death they escalated to the basic measures. We use in analytical epidemiology. To express a Association. Furthermore you want to know where did she actually new found is really felt it. So did it reflected through did. So is really a red meat intake does increase the risk of Type two diabetes or. Could it be for example that. With persons who ate red meat. Are also smokers should. Actually you're not looking to read me to take. And type two diabetes. But you're looking to smoking. And type two diabetes. So you are going to ruin. A lot about Felicity. Issues that. Play a role when you study and as for Shay sure. So related to this. You also learn more about the determinants of several non-communicable diseases. And lastly you are going to learn about the measures of disease screening. So deaths about a test. You want to apply. Today tax persons with type two diabetes for example. How ever if you develop such a test. It could be that. Part of the participants that used to test. Are classified as type two diabetes. Although these participants don't have type two diabetes. It would also be the order of a around. That you classify a participant at not having Type two diabetes. Although. This participant. Has type two diabetes. So debt's what you're going to focus on. That's related to measures of disease screening. So did this. Are the topics. You are going to study each week. So you started with. What's the difference between. As a shape. As a shim. You are also going to you know. Do you know more about a study design and let's go up a Demi or G.. However in detail the east side of the zones are discussed in week three. And we won you. Also going to learn more about a political issues. In week two. You focus on the measures you can use. Measures of. Association and also measures of public health impact and. A last you focus on the. Prevention paradox. So we treated designs and. Furthermore you learn more about what a risk factors. Of several. Non-communicable diseases like. Type two diabetes and cancer. In week four. Oh we have the. The topic is disease screening. And in a week five. You will make any. Ache Sam. So do this under learning activities related to each week. So in each week you are going to read literature and watch clips. See it over here. More duels are scheduled in week. Week. To you and you. Week for. We have also individual assignment. In week two Group assignments. Can be found in week one. In week three and a week for each week. A self that is available. The closer assignment is related to your close reassignment you did in a previous course. And that starts in week one. And that. If you will finish this assignment in week. Five. This Art Of course materials. So you know this book. We used to several chapters. From this book. And you'll have course have the knowledge clips and. Emo deals. So. This is how this. Course will be accessed. First you will do a exam and dad's. Guns are buttes sixty percent. To do it and. Mark. A you will. Ahead and make a poster. And this contribute to twenty five percent to the total mark. And finally to close your assignment. Counts for a fifteen percent. So note. So please be aware that you have to admit. It's in your field Sure. If each were part. Shield. Have at least a five point five. And that these. These marks. Remain valid for a period of six years. So this is what is cautious about. About learning outcomes you know more about the structure of the course about the topics they're learning activity. And how they will be accessed. So good luck with this course. I hope you enjoy. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "You know my name is here on the near noir. I guess you know me by now. I'm going to introduce you to a project for the first projects within the continuous course. As you know to continuous course consists of three parts. First is the skills part. Which takes the first and the second year. And then you will do one prone to projects. One projects in the first year. And another project. In the second. And for the first one. I'm going to explain you. What you're going to do. And the. Projects is a group assignment. And you're going to work in groups of six students sort of means that there will be four groups. And it actually starts. Now in October. And it will last until July next year. The learning I was kind of the first projects is to plan an attrition related to health promotion intervention. Quite some difficult. Words but I'm going to explain. An intervention that is based on behavior change. Theories and on. Evidence. What do we know that works and it's effective. Based on the literature on evidence and on also on theories. The final output of the first projects is a group report. Describing the planning of the intervention. Of course you're not really developing an intervention. Yourself the materials. Bits. You're going to describe the planning of such an intervention and. The report is. Maximum forty pages. Well interventions I promise you to explain a bit more. What it is for do we mean. Well. Intervening actually means. Interfering in order to improve or to promote. People's health. And often that's very complex because. Why do we know it's always eat healthy food wise it's also nice to eat snacks or. Products with a lot of sugar. And there is a lot of factors influencing our behavior. Regarding that. And this is a very nice example that was recently in the lancets. And it explains. Very nicely how complexities. Also for governments to influence people's food preferences. And here you see. Individuals and schools. Having a role in that. But also food producers and retailers. And of course also to policies of the government itself. Well in this project that you're going to work on the interventions will mainly be in this domain. So what can we do in schools in health services. And how can we also directly influence people's eating. Behavior. And their you focus on the most important and manage. Most changeable factors. For example if you work on a program. On obesity among children. You can do. An education program for children in school. Or you can do an intervention for parents. Did they provide the children with. Healthy food. So those are some examples. So what you're going to do in projects one. Is splendid very systematically. The development of such. Interventions. OK so how are you going to do deaths. There are actually five steps. First you're going to present a case. Then you will select a topic. As a group. They will get started to work as a group. Then you will work. On the projects and then there will be the final report and. You also see here. The different timelines that are allocated for each step. I'm going to explain them briefly. First of all you're going to present a case. So you will select a case from your own country. Or maybe even from your own working environment if you work for him. For an. Going to zation that this promoting health. Of course it should be. Nutrition. Related. And it should be related to a certain. Health problem already Zeese for example diabetes is or cardiovascular diseases. The problem should be. Importance. And you can show the importance. By showing. Prevalence or incidence figures. How often does the problem. Occur. But also looking at its security for example Ebola. In the first case it was not very prevalence. But of course it was very severe and very new. So that's could also be a reason for choosing a certain health topic. Then another criteria to select your case is that it should be changeable. With an intervention. So either. By focusing on the people with the health problem. Or focusing on other people who can influence the decrease. Of the health problem. And prefer a bully but I also understand that's not possible for all of you select case that is like a real life case so if you can do it within your own organization that would be really great. Then after you have prepared. Your case you're going to make a pitch. Of about two or three minutes. So it will be a video. A fairly short video where you're going to sell your project idea to the group members of your group. You don't know who will be in your group yet. But you're going to pitch. Your idea to them. And this has to be done. Latest on November first. So the to be off the desk and continue with making the groups. And also importance you can ask advice once. To me to see whether your case. Is useful. So that's. I can give comments or feedback. Or maybe you can improve your case. After us after asking feedback. To me. So you can do it at once. Then the second step is. You will be part of a group. And the chorus moderators. We will make groups of six members and we will use certain criteria. We've a look at your education and professional backgrounds. Make sure that there is a variety. If possible have people from the same time zone. In one group. Because that also makes. Discussions easier. And if possible also a variety of countries. We will communicate this to you on November ninth. And us today which you will make a top three of the topics within your group. Of course it will be six topics. From each member. One topic. And you're going to make a top three. And you can also include your own. Topic. In that. And then as a group you're going to select one topic. To work on. Into projects. Until July next year and these topics. One topic for each group. Should be selected. On November twenty second. And then there will be some other steps in November in December you will get started as a group. You have to defy tasks. Make agreements on how to work as a group. Then from generally to July. You will work on the project and. We will give further instructions how you can do that. And finally you're going to produce a report which has to be finished on. In July next year. Then there are two people who are going to guide you. That's will be me. Being the expert. So I know about. Interventions and intervention planning. So that's what we call the content of the projects and. Those early. Will be the moderator of the course. Guiding to group process. This and skills. So for example if there exists any difficulties. Within the group. Process. Maybe one person is not able to contribute as much as the others. This is something that you will discuss with those early. Then. I need to say something about the assessment of the projects. As you may also know the whole continuous course. Is a total of twelve. Easy ts. Consisting of three elements the skills. Project one and Project two and Project one. Will account for twenty five percent of your and Mark. For the continuous course. And each part. Has to be at least a five point five So it also holds for your report on projects one. Yeah as I said before a process in a project is part of skills. So that's the first part. And the contents into projects. Is assessed separately. So in Project Rwanda this. Contents of the report. So summarizing these are the five steps. With all the timelines. Next to it. So the first thing for you to do now is to prepare a case. And prepare a pitch. Thank you.",

                "text": "Hello my name is Don from come and in this clip I would like to discuss the lifestyles of filamentous plant pathogens. Fungi and all my states. Fungi know my seeds are actually two very distant ducks are in the tree of life. Fungi are very related to animals. Whereas all my seeds are much more related to brown algae. And it is thought that these two have diverged. About a billion years ago. In evolution. Nevertheless fungi in all my seeds. Have a similar capacity to infect plants. And they have similar. Similar vegetative growth morphology. In the two images you see on the right bottom. There are hifi of one fungus and one over my seat. And unless you are an expert you cannot tell the difference between them. Also. They have a similar morphology of infection structure. And these are three examples of convergent evolution. Between these toxic. Filamentous plant pathogens can have different lifestyles. They can either behave as a by a trough. In which they need. Living plant cells and living plant to shoes. To grow on. Or they can behave as a necker trough where they kill the plant issue. And then eat it. They can also act as a Hemi by a trough. Where they first have a bio trophic face until their well established inside the plant. And then they switch to the next or traffic phase kill the cells and degraded tissue. There also filamentous. Organisms that have end of phytic behavior. And Mike arise or that are symbionts of plants. But I will not discuss these further in this clip. Different steps are distinguished. In the disease cycle of microbes and. When the spores. Of a microbe. Attached to a plant surface. They germinate. And in some cases form a penetration structure. They spent ration structure than. Penetrates the host surface and. Establishes. Inside the plant. The micro begins to feed and. At some stage begins to expand and colonize the plant. Tissue. At all stages inside the plant. The pathogen must obviously either suppress the immune response of the plant. Or when it cannot suppress it it must counteract the defense response of the plant. Upon successful expansion of colonization. The pathogen. Can make new spores and these spores can then disperse. To other plants. These different processes. Are controlled by all kinds of different situation. Of cell types and tissue types. And they require different proteins and different types of gene expression. And this is the term and. By the genetic toolbox. That the organisms have. And the genetic toolbox the genome. Determines the lifestyle. Whether an organism can be a by a troll of a Hemi via trove. Or a neck or truth. I will discuss the different steps. In the disease cycle. In the next few slides. And I begin with the beginning of. Beginning of an infection. The penetration of the whole surface. Some. Microbial pathogens. Passively enter the plant through natural openings. Such as a stalemate. Or a wound surface. In some cases. They can produce. Enzymes that destroy the plant's surface. Such as cute in Ace's of cell or lasers and pectin Ace's and they give the microbe. Entry to the plant. And there are also some. Pathogenic microbes that produce an infection structure an upper story him. That is able to penetrate. Actively by brute physical force. And that is illustrated in these images. You can see here. A spore of the fungus Magna Porter grittier the rice blast fungus. Which has. Minator it. And then developed an episode on the planned surface. This episode him. As a melon ice. Outer wall that is very rigid. And very strong. And the structure is extremely tightly glued to the surface. Inside the upper story and there is a high of small thick pressure. Due to degeneration of a high concentration of Lister all. And its highest multi pressure. Enables the structure. To make a hifi. High for that. That penetrates the plant's surface. And then enters the plant. You can see in the image on the right here. A scanning electron microscope. Picture where the upper saurian was actually. Brushed off. And you can see the scar that is left of the base of the upper story attached to the plant's surface. And you can see the poor of that infection Haifa. Has made. Inside the plant tissue. And it is amazing that this upper story. Is able to generate a pressure. Of eighty bar. Inside this. Small structure. This is the highest physical pressure that has ever been measured in a living organism. I should mention that not all upper Soria invade by physical force. But the magnet for the grizzly upper story in the US. By generating this pressure of a T. bar after the penetration. Feeding structures can be formed. And they are called How story. And they are made. Especially by by a trophic and Hemi by trophic pathogens. Such as rust and mill use. The whole story is formed. After the local and very subtle. Perforation of the plant cell wall where the host cell must stay alive. So you see a schematic illustration here. Of a whole story I'm. Where the plant cell. Is perforate. It here. And a global organ. Is inserted into the host. Cytoplasm. After this perforation. The House story. Has a plasma membrane. Surrounding it. That is in direct contact with the plant plus membrane. And this. Close surface contact. Makes it possible to efficiently transport all kinds of metabolites. As well as affect us. The metabolites that are transported. Are small molecules that are in the plant cytoplasm. And are taken up by the whole story him. To feed the pathogen. And the effect is are produced in dollar story. And they are secreted. Into the plant cytoplasm. To suppress the immune response. And in the image on the right. You see here. This. Blue thread is on Haifa. Of the oh my seat. He allopurinol Spira are to be drops of this. And the. Circles here. Are the house story of this. Oh my seat. That are inserted in the cytoplasm. Of mezza fuel cells. Of the host. Out of it upsets. They're also heavy by traffic pathogens and. They actually have a lifestyle that that gives the best of both worlds. When an upper saurian is formed. And penetrates. It forms a visible in the epidermis cell of the host. And from this visa call. Primary hifi are formed. That can enter into the neighboring cells. And thereby this. Pathogen. Slowly moves from one cell to the next. When it has firmly established in the host. It can switch to a necker trophic lifestyle. Where it forms a secondary hifi. That grow much faster or much thinner. And they produce all kinds of toxins. And so we're degrading enzymes. To kill and degrade the host tissue. And many. Pathogens both all my seeds and. Fungi have such a lifestyle. The best study to me by itself. Is this rice blast fungus Magna Porta grazier that I showed you before. And it has some very exciting features. It is very flexible and athletic. It is able to squeeze its way through plus more this matter. To reach the next cell. And if you consider that a plasma this model of a plant. Is in the order of forty nanometer in wit. And a high five is about one micron in with. This is comparable to a human being squeezing its. Him self. Through a door opening of a few centimeters. And. It is illustrated here in this image in panel. E. Where the fungus. Is labeled with the green fluorescent protein so you can see the fungus in green and you can barely see plant cells. But at the position of these arrows. This is where the plant cell wall is and where the plus more Desmond. Is connecting to cells. And the fungus to squeeze its way through this very narrow opening. And then after entering the next cell. It has again widened. To its normal with. And there is a fascinating movie. That shows this process where you can actually see the fungus. In live action. Doing this movement. To neighboring cells and I can highly recommend that you watch this. After the Buy It was in him you buy it was there also Necker trolls. And they actually. Exploit. The plant cell death machinery. They produce. Affect the molecules that are recognized by receptors and then. Induce the program sell this program. We know that by the traffic microbes also produce effect is. To suppress the immune response. And they can also be recognized by receptors called. Resistance proteins. And that also in use is programmed cell death. Now the Receptus for neck or trophic effect is and by a terrific effect as are very similar in structure. And sequence. And the recognition mechanism is similar. But the outcome is totally opposite. Where the recognition of a by a terrific effect or by resistance proteins leads to cell death. And resistance of the plant. The recognition of a negative effect or. By receptor. Needs to cell death. And susceptibility of the plant. And in this situation. There is often an inverse gene for Gene interaction. Where the recognition of an acquittal figure factor. Leads to affect or. Triggered. Susceptibility. And in fact. The best way to get resistance to Necker trophic pathogens. Is to prevent the occurrence of program cell death. The message for this subject. Is that there are pathogenic filamentous microbes. Into widely distant ducks are. The fungi and the oh my seeds. And they can have one of three. Traffic lifestyles by its rules. I mean by trolls negatives. There are different stages in the infection. Process that we can distinguish the penetration. You stablish with the feeding. And the expansion face. And we can study all this by molecular and cellular. Methods. Some pathogenic microbes. Used to penetrate. And some. In some cases this occurs by force and. By a traffic and I mean by traffic pathogens. Use How story. As feeding structures. And finally Necker trolls. Exploit and abuse. The plant. Program sell this. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is Ian from Cannes and in this clip. I would like to discuss how bacterial plant pathogens see dater hosts. During the infection process. Plants are perfectly able to recognize bacterial molecules. As non-self. They can recognize cell wall components. Or enzymes. Which serve as. Pathogen. Associated molecular patterns or bumps. The recognition of plants is mediated by a sort of radar. That the plant has a receptor that induces triggered immunity and this process leads to the activation of defense responses. Where the plant. Is resistant to the bacteria. And obviously. If a bacterium wants to be successful. It needs to suppress the plant immune response. And it can do this by using. Effect or. Molecules. Effectors. Suppressed immune response. Resulting in effect a triggered susceptibility. And there is a zigzag model. That describes the evolutionary development. Of the system where a pump. Can be recognised by areas scepter. Leading to pump triggered immunity. And a low level of defense activation. So here is the defense amplitude. Illustrated in a certain response. Pathogens. Have evolved. Effectors. That suppress the pantry get immunity. And thereby. Give this. Back to this organism. The ability to colonize the plant. The plants have then. Evolved. A resistance protein that recognises this effector. And there. By triggers effects are triggered immunity. Causing a hypersensitive response and. Making the plant resistant pathogens have then again evolved a second effect or. That suppresses the action of the first resistance gene. And restores. Sept ability of the plant. And this has led to the evolution of a second. Resistance. Protein that recognizes the second effect or and restores the immunity. It has long been known that bacteria. Produce effectors. That are located inside the plant cells. Whereas the bacteria. Are located on the outside. So how do these effectors get into the. Cytoplasm. Of the host plant. For this purpose. Plant pathogens. Have evolved. A specialist see creation channel. This channel acts as a needle like structure. And is referred to as the trance locum. And the needle sticks. Through the cell wall and applies membrane of the host and allows the injection. Of compounds from the bacterium. Into the host. Now this type three secretion system is built of different protein complexes. This is the inside of the bacterial cell and. There is a basal plate. Of different proteins. With a protein that actually. Forms the look of the. Of the needle structure. There is a protein complex. That crosses the inner membrane of the protein. And a complex that crosses the outer membrane of the protein. And there is a protein complex that forms the needle structure. That reaches all the way. To the plasma membrane of the host. And finally. There is a protein complex that forms a poor. In the host plus a membrane. To open the needle and. Allow molecules. To travel from one side. To the other the. Poor size of the channels. Is in the range of a few nanometers. And this is enough for. Unfolded proteins. To move into the plant. And the image here. Illustrates how this works. The effect of protein. Is inside the cytoplasm. Of the bacterium. And it is bound by a chaperone protein. And the chaperone protein unfolds. The effector. And hooks it to a. A.T.P.'s complex. The A.T.P.'s complex than hydrolyzed is A.T.P.. To. A.T.P. and phosphate. And this generates energy. That allows the effect of protein. To move into the needle structure. And then. It can travel freely. Up and into the host. Cytoplasm. So this is the way in which this see creation channel works. The type three secretion system. Is composed of many different proteins that are in different places in the structure. So it must be encoded by different. Ends by different genes. The genes that encode these proteins are actually clustered in the bacterial genome. And they form the HAARP Gene cluster. And the abbreviation harp. Is for hypersensitive response and pathogenicity. Because this structure is needed for these two processes. The presence of all these genes. In a single cluster. Actually makes this a single regulatory and genetic unit. And sometimes the hard Gene cluster. Is located on a place mate. Which enables it to be transmitted to other bacteria. By conjugation. In the image. You see the structure of the harp in clusters of. Five animal pathogenic bacteria and five. Plant pathogenic bacteria. And the different colors. Of the genes. Indicate that they have. Sequence homology. And you can clearly see from callers. That both. Animal pathogens have red proteins. As well as some. Plant pathogenic bacteria. So by just looking at the colors. And the shapes. Within these boxes. As you can recognize that these genes and proteins are related to one another so it is a an evolutionary conserved. Feature of both. Animal and plant pathogens. The type three secretion. System. Is not always active. It is only activated. In the presence of the host. So the expression of the hard genes. Actually requires an environmental stimulus. Which in the case of plant pathogens is probably a plant molecule. We don't know this but it is assumed that the plant molecule. Activates the transcription of these genes. And then the proteins are produced. They form the structure. They form the needle and. It allows the transport. Of the effectors. To the host cytoplasm. So the message for the subject. Is the plant pathogenic bacteria. Must suppress plant defense responses. In order to successfully invade their host. In fact they sedate the host. They put it to sleep. Come it down and then invade. They do this by injecting affect the proteins. Into the host cytoplasm using this new life structure called. The type three secretion system. It sticks out from the bacterial wall. It perforates the plant cell wall. And the plant. Plus membrane. And thereby. Does its job. I thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is Ian from come. And in this clip I would like to discuss how plant pathogenic bacteria. Use community behavior. To infect their host. Bacteria are obviously unicellular organisms that divide by budding. Since they cannot differentiate any infection structures they must enter plants. Through natural openings. Such as wounds or still mates. Once inside the plant. They can swim because their flagella. And they can also stick to a surface. By the formation of a biofilm. There are plant pathogenic bacteria in different bacterial general. And the names. Might be familiar to some of you. Within a genius. There are different species. And within a species there can sometimes be part of ours. According to the host specificity. For example in the species for the monitoring. There are more than one hundred parts of us described in literature. The symptoms that are caused by plant pathogenic bacteria. Can differ. And some illustrations are given in the images below. There are roughly three types of symptoms. That can be wrought. When cell walls of plants are degraded and. It looks water soaked and slimy. That can also be wilting. And dry any crosses. When the first killer system is blocked and water transport is inhibited. Or there can be chlorosis and yellowing. Of the infected tissue. Bacteria are obviously much smaller than plants. And this gives more or less the proportional size of a bacterial cell to a compared to a plant cell. A bacterium on its own. Obviously does not have much chance to conquer this. This plant cell. It must build up an army. Before it starts attacking. And the build up must occur very quietly. So. Imagine. There is a single bacterium here. Inside the cell and. Inside a plant. And it is approaching this cell which forms. A formidable warier. The cell must. The bacteria must divide. In order to grow grow grow and create a higher density. Until it reaches the size of a decent army. But this army. Needs to attack. All of the same time. And until the moment of the attack. They must remain quiet. So the bacteria must be able to sense its density. How do bacteria know when they have reached a sufficiently high density. To attack. They use a system called Quorum sensing. Where they initiate the attack. Only when a very high cell density is reached when a certain threshold a quorum is reached. And they can sense the density. By the use of a small signal molecule called an. A seal homo steering lock down. Or a H.L.. At the high concentration of H. L. transcription isn't used or genes that are required for the infection. And in the image on the left. You see one bacterial cell. Producing three H.-L. molecules. They diffuse away. And the concentration is low. And therefore the gene expression is low. And there is a faint blue color in this cell. When there are more cells. Such as in the right image. Each cell still produces three H L molecules. But because of the higher density of bacteria the concentration of H. L. is higher. And that induces the expression of. The expression genes. And cells turn more blue. So in this situation bacteria clearly. Act as a community. How does the core I'm sensing work. Inside the bacterium. Bacteria. I have a protein called lox I. Which is involved in the production of the H L N T H L then freely defuses. In and out of the cells. At a high concentration. The eight shell binds to the Lux are protein. And that activates the protein and. The looks are protein is a transcription factor. That is involved in the transcription of. Virulence genes. So in this way a high concentration of H L. Leads to. Fairlands. The chemical structures. Of the H.-L. molecules are depicted here. Different bacteria can produce different H.-L. molecules in the green box. You see the homo Syrian locked on more U.-T. which is conserved. Among all the molecules. And in the blue box. You see the a seal moiety of the molecule which can differ between different bacteria. Quorum sensing regulates different types of processes. For example the production of plant cell degrading enzymes that are involved in the rot and the mass ration. They destroy host cells and they allow invasion. And in image one on the left. You can see that. The structure of. Pectin. Is destroyed by the function of different. Enzymes different back in your little enzymes that are in the core and sensing control. Also Coron sensing may control the production of toxins that course plant chlorosis and he crosses. Such as illustrated in the image in the middle. And the formation of antibiotics that are involved in the competition with other microbes. Can also be under Quorum sensing control. And that is illustrated in image number three. And also the formation of biofilm the sticking two surfaces. Can be on the core and sensing control. In different bacteria. If form sensing is so important. Can we actually design a strategy to interfere with this mechanism. And thereby enhance the resistance of plants. To specific bacteria. We might use. We might use transgenic plants that can degrade Quorum sensing molecules. Or we might exploit bio control bacteria that are able to degrade these molecules. And this strategy has been used and is referred to as poor am. Quenching. And Koran quenching appears to work in several cases. And I've illustrated this. In the next slide. Where transgenic plants are used. That express an enzyme from Busta lists. That degrades Quorum sensing molecules. The transgenic plants are labeled with tea and to control plants with the sea. And you see images taken. At twenty hours. And sixty hours after infiltration of a pathogenic bacteria that causes. Rot. Mass ration. In the tissue. You see a twenty hours. That the control plants. Show. Water soaked. Areas of rot. Of the bacterium infecting this plant. And the transgenic plant clearly has less symptoms. At sixty hours. The control plants are completely water soaked. Rotten destroyed. Dead. And the transgenic plants. Show some symptoms but clearly less. It's important to realize that in these transgenic plants. The pathogenic bacteria. That have been inoculated. Are present. But they simply do not express their plants or were degrading enzymes and therefore. They cause less symptoms. So the strategy works. To some extent. The message for this subject. Is that plant pathogenic bacteria. Can cause very different types of symptoms. But only if they build a community. Before they start attacking the plant. And to build this community. They use. Corum sensing molecules to monitor their cell density and regulate their gene expression. And corn quenching. Can reduce the damage. That is caused by bacteria. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is John from come. And in this clip I would like to discuss the structure and function of plant genes that are involved in resistance to attack us. In this light. You can see two tobacco plants that have been inoculated with the tobacco musique virus. T.M.V.. And in the. Left image. You see a plant. That doesn't carry any resistance gene. And it shows the typical symptoms of the tobacco has a fabulous. The plant on the right side. Has the resistance gene. N.. And that confers. A hyper sensitive response to the virus. That results in the formation of necrotic spots. In which to plant. It which makes the plant resistant. Resistance genes. Control. A hyper sensitive response which is a form of programmed cell death. And it is an active suicide process. Which is initiated. Upon the recognition of. Effectors. By these are proteins. The hyper sensitive response can be visualized by following cell or processes which start with the cessation of cytoplasmic streaming. Followed by the disappearance of microtubules. And the appearance of particles in the vacuum or. Then in the nucleus. D.N.A. is cleaved and. Inside the cell. Hydrogen peroxide. Is accumulating. This results in the collapse of the proto Plast. And finally. Fluorescence occurs in the plant cell wall. And this completes the program cell death program. This process. Is As I said initiated by the recognition of an effect or. By a resistance protein. So what are these resistance proteins. Plants have two classes of resistance proteins of which. The first class. Occurs inside the plant cytoplasm. And recognizes. The proteins that are inside the plant cells and the second class. Is occurring in the last and. They recognize. Effectors. That are located outside the plant cells. Both resistance proteins are built up. Of protein modules protein domains. And these differ somewhat the class one proteins. Have either. TEAR. Or C C domains which are involved in protein protein interactions. They also have an N.B.S. domain. Which is a nuclear tied binding site. Involved in the binding and the hydrolysis of. A.T.P. which generates energy. For a conformational change of the protein. And they have a. L R R domain. A loosing rich repeat. Which is considered to be. The link in binding domain. The class two proteins. Have also an L R R domain. Again involved in leg and binding. Now on the outside of the plant cell. And they have a trans membrane domain. Which sticks. The protein. In the plus membrane of the cell. Some class two proteins. Also have an interest cell or kinase domain. Which is involved in the phosphorylation of other proteins. But other some class two proteins do not have such a kindness domain. So these are the two major classes of proteins that we know about. There are two ways in which. Resistance proteins can detect. Effectors. They either make a direct physical contact with the effect or. Where the effect of functions as a ligand. And the resistance protein is the. Receptor. And the binding. Of the link into the receptor. Activates a signal transduction process. Which leads to all kinds of cellular responses. And changes in gene expression. And this follows a classical leg and. Receptor mechanism. The second way of the detection. Is an indirect recognition of the effect or. By sensing. It's perturbation. Of a cofactor effectors. Target specific host proteins. To suppress the immune response. And promotes violence of the attacker. So the host protein to this target it is called the villains target. And they are often key players in the immune response of the plant. If the effect or. Moves. And binds to the variance target. It perturbs the function of the virulence target. And thereby suppresses the immunity. And the resistance protein guards' difference target. To retain the immunity. There is a hypothesis that describes this mechanism. And it is called the God hypothesis. In which the effector is a thief. And it is out to get the treasure. And the treasure is the villains target and. The cowboy on the right hand side. Functions as a guard. That is just monitoring the situation. Of the villains target. So the guard does not need to recognize the thief. But it can actually see the action of any thief. The tries to obtain. This treasure this villain's target. And it is thought that this mechanism. Allows the. The plant to make more efficient use of its limited repertoire of receptor proteins. By guarding. Common virulence targets that are attacked by multiple effectors. And multiple pathogens. Also it is important to note that the signaling pathways that are activated by resistance proteins. Often converge. Into very similar. Resistance mechanisms. And in this light. You can see for different effect the proteins. Of the. Bacterium Pseudomonas. A RING A that I recognized by three different resistance proteins. Rpm one. R.P.'s two. And R.P.'s four. And there is in effect a protein. R P P five. Which is recognized by the resistance gene R P P five. Of the. Oh my seat. Paranoias for a parasitic. And if the resistance genes are P M one and R.P.'s two recognise the corresponding effect as either directly or in directly. They activate the protein. And they are one which. Then triggers a signal. Transduction cascade. To activate the cell or silly as it mediated resistance. To bacteria and to my seat. Also the resistance proteins R.P.S. for an R P P five. Both signal. But they both activate the E.D.S. one protein. That funnels into the signal transduction. Pathway that. Also activates the cell or silica as it mediated resistance to bacteria. And all my seats. So the message for this subject. Is that resistance proteins of plants. Trigger a hypersensitive response. When they interact with an effect. They are located. Either in the cytoplasm. Or in the Plus remembering. And the upper plussed. They can either directly bind to an effect or. Or they can recognize the action of an effect or. By monitoring the status of the villain's target. As described in the God hypothesis. And different resistance proteins. Can activate signaling pathways that converge. Into very similar. Resistance mechanisms. To attack us. I thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "So how do identify these fish this fish can be identified with a proper key and in this case we start with a key for the freshwater fish of Europe that means we need to know before hand that this is actually a freshwater fish which is given as knowledge so we can start with using this key this key is divided into different plants and you have to go true all characteristics behind each number to actually make a decision and this case it says. In Copeland one the characteristics are in one way no jaws mouth's authorial Seven Natural guilt bores and you like or one be true jaws Gill covered by zero Perkel And as you can see this has really true jaws and Perkel a gill cover which means we have to go to two\n\n into Dartrey options first is upturned tail axes body with lots or bony plates small transversal mouth would transfer roll bar balls well we can easily see this is not the case. To be says eyes on one side of the head and swims on left side which is also not the case we can see that the call fin is symmetrical into see. It is not absent but the symmetrical and the eyes are each side of the head so. To see is the one which applies so we go through to number tree.\n\n Entry there are many options which will not go to or will not go to all of them will concentrate on three D. entry and death if you go to treat F. says it hasn't Adipose fins so affect fin between the single dorsal and called fin Well here is the dorsal fin here is the coral fin and there's nothing in between there. Then tree D. and tree e if you go to tree it says one dorsal fin which fits the ventral fin is below the tip of the Petrel Theon and this is a bit tricky but what it means is that the ventral fin this one.\n\n Is actually below the tip that the IP of the dorsal fin of the pectoral three and we can see that actually the ventral fin is situated behind the tip of the back trophy and this is here so they actually is applying is three D. wonderful thing and the ventral fin is behind the vertical of the tip of the back shelf in so we go on to four.\n\n In four also has five different options I won't go to Go go through all the characteristics in four A It says a lot larger jaws and teeth well this fish species does not have any teeth as you can see for that doesn't apply.\n\n The others are all dealing with the dorsal fin the base of the doors will fit while this is the base of the dorsal fin it says in four be the base of those who is behind the center of the body the center of the body is here so the dorsal fin is above the center of the body it doesn't have a particularly small mouth and the fish is also not a small size so for be also doesn't apply then for C. It says the doors of fin over the middle of the body that does apply but it says that the belly is killed and there is no letter line and bubbles are absent there is a lateral lie there are babbles and there is no sharp keel on the belly so for C. does not apply but what does apply is for the abdomen is mostly round it\n\n has a lateral line and it has never more than two pairs of bubbles that actually does have two pairs and not four five Bibles so for the applies if we go to key. And key M. is a key which works a bit differently because you have to compare side by side and this particular case it is a. Or a in A it says bubbles present at the rear of the mouth which is the case because A says bubbles absent so that means we go to be\n\n B. says the base of the dorsal fin is short seven to twelve branched race you see here that the doors for that actually quite long and has more than seven brides raise their seventeen or more branches raise it has large scales the ones that are there are quite large it also says but maybe absent which is the case in this fish finish short\n\n the first full length array is separated and you can see that he had a small saw ration at the end of this. Spine.\n\n Widely distributed mainly in bones you can see that of course when you have the fish lying here but we can conclude that this is the common cops or Prince Carpio.\n\n This is another example of a fish that we can identify with the key for the freshwater fish in this case we already start in Coupland three because the first two are quite obvious and you can see that for yourself.\n\n In all these opportunities are all these choices you have in key tree. A number of them are very clearly not a blip a ball like tree a long body encased in bone you rings the ventral fins are not shaped as an elliptical sucker as in free B. It is not a very elegant gate is it more or less standard shape fish it says here one dorsal fin So that is true in this case so that might be a blip a ball.\n\n Tree is also one dorsal fin and three F. says an Adipose fin between the single dorsal and coral fin and actually we see quite quickly that this Adipose fin is there and the post fin is different from a normal fin because it's a lobe of tissue basically but without being supported by brain CULE bye bye bye fin race so that means that we go on to five.\n\n In five it says bubbles on the head which it does not have it says it has a small fleshy process about above the root of the ventral fin and then the character in five cities are actually quite useful as the cucumber smell fresh because there's not very fresh and the dorsal fin is not enlarged Well those if it is not and largest So the thing we have to look for is whether that has a small fleshy process above the root of the ventral feed this is the ventral fin and does it have fleshy processes and it does have a small extension here.\n\n A process as it call as it is called a kind of lobe of tissue above the ventral fin and that means we go to Key L. the salmon's\n\n inky L. It has the top part of it says Salmon like fish is with the post fin a and a fish with the posts in between the dorsal fin and the tail and that will lead us through again to the hue cumber smelling smells which we do not have in fact we are dealing with the salmon like fishes and we go to key one the fish with the bows fins found in fresh water so we go to the bottom of the slide says a first dorsal fin base not longer than the head length the raised not greatly longer eight and let's look at this first characteristic and it says The first goes off in base a longer than the head length Well this is the dorsal fin.\n\n The length of the fin base is this and as you can see it is clearly shorter than the head length and that means we go to be.\n\n And B. it says teeth in the jaws are well developed also on the palate and tongue and scales small to minute never fewer than one thousand from the first dorsal Ray bass to the lateral lied and the first Those are a basis here to the lateral line and has many scales more than nineteen it also has clearly developed teeth which you can best feel it is clearer than when you look at the fish even hear them touching them.\n\n Because in B.B. A test is enjoys menu or absent which is clearly not the case so we can go to see.\n\n See the difficult one that says scale small fewer than one hundred fifty in a series from head to tail less than twenty eight scales from the first those will fit in to the letter A line teeth present on all absent from the head of the foam which is the ballot in a single if staggered row along the shaft of the Vollmer this last one is an internal characteristic of the mouth which is very different difficult to see.\n\n In this case it's best to just. Count the scales which is quite a lot on the sides of the fish from the beginning to end and if you do that you'll find that there are fewer than fifty so we go to D..\n\n The extreme end of the upper jaw reaches well past the level of the Hind edge of the eye is often a measure of close reading if you look at the figure fifty eight you can see that it says the extreme edge of the upper jaw here.\n\n Reaches beyond the edge of the eye\n\n and that is in this case that is true because the edge is behind the eyes so we go to eat.\n\n It says skill small thirty to sixty from the other posts into the letter a line in oblique series or scales very small fifteen to sixteen from the other posts in to the letter A line anal fin with nine to eleven branches raise.\n\n The easiest way of looking at it in fact all characteristics from one should apply but sometimes it is easier to start with one in with nine to eleven brides for a so if we look at the end of fin here.\n\n It's difficult to see the picture but if you start counting.\n\n How many branches raised there are I count one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven\n\n and that means actually he applies which is the rainbow trout.\n\n With this fish we also start again at Cooper three and again we're going to skip the very obvious ones that are not a political like tree a tree see.\n\n And then we focus on the dorsal fin in the fish that we saw before it said one dorsal fin and they actually had one dorsal fin how many dorsal fins has this fish got if you look properly you would think at first glance this is one dorsal fin but if you look properly you'll see that this is a fin with hard spies and here this part of the dorsal fin has actually soft race so what is a political in this case is. Tree H. tree sorry to dorsal fins separate or contiguous so those two dorsal fins in this case there are contiguous they are placed next to each other but they are two different fins go to six\n\n if you go to Google it six it says Chin barbel present second dorsal fin Longwell it does not have a chin barbel we can't see anything here the ventral thin beneath the rear or tip of the back often dorsal fins well separated Well the dorsal fins are not well separated so we know that this is not the case so six C. must be a pleasurable and six C. It says ventral fin under at least the front half of the pectoral fin So the ventral fin is indeed under the pectoral fin So we go to seven.\n\n In seven says bodies scaled anal fin with two spines while the body is clearly scale that if we go to the anal fin it also has spawned and we can count one two three tree lines so seven eight is not a playable. Seventy says the body scales are an orphan with tree or more spines that does apply especially because seven seed the body without skill does not apply so you would think that seven B. is the right answer the sunfish is but there is a snag here because this is a tropical fish which is not included in the key so the key for European species would lead you to seven Be the sun fishes while in fact this fish belongs to the sickly day which is the sickly its It is related to the central Arcade's the sun fishes but this is not the same thing.",

                "text": "To illustrate how nomenclature works in practice. Will give you some examples from the work that we did ourselves in northern Ethiopia. The first researcher to actually go to the lake diluted his lake in northern Ethiopia was the famous biologist Edward ripple. From Germany. And he bought some fish on the eastern shores of the lake. And he found. Five new species. Five new species of bubbles of which you see four here. And he also described a species. He called the lobby or barbers. Later on. Hundreds of new species of barbers were actually described. Because many of these. Carp like fishes from Asia and Europe and also from Africa were all. Considered to be very very similar to this barbers and. By nine hundred eleven. When the African. Fish catalog was published by the Natural History Museum. More than one hundred eighty species of barbers were actually described a large and small species. And in that them to clear up this. What they called a taxonomic waste bin. Gives Bannister from the Natural History Museum in one thousand nine hundred three Bubblicious study in which he revised. As they call it. The large barbers from East Africa. And he concluded that. Almost all species that were described previously. Were just different varieties of one very very plastic species including. All the species from Lake Donna. And because of nomenclature. And the rules in there. They had to be named by the. All this published names. The oldest published name. And that was the name. Already assigned by Ru Paul called Bob's into medius. Eight hundred thirty five. But. Later when researchers from back in university including myself. Went to like Diana to actually do some fisheries research. We found enormous diversity. Of all these fishes in like that and we wondered. Is this really. One species. Extensive study of the biology and the genetics and the feeding behavior and also the reproduction. We concluded. No it is not one species we are actually dealing with more than one species with several species. Around fifteen. But since we were not that's all amiss we didn't want to stumble into that. Basically into the normal at you and all the taxonomy. So we just gave these different species or morphs as we call them fifteen different ones. We just gave them informal names descriptive names like big mouse small AI for obvious reasons. Especially the big mouth is obvious. And the other one. We call duck. Because of its color. But eventually we could not avoid it in case you want to publish stuff. You cannot avoid giving. Formal names or confronting at least what you have found with the literature that existed. And then we found out that actually some of these all descriptions were very good. And there are probably some of these old names. Were still valid as you can see here from the drawing. By ripple. And a picture that we made. Of the species that we call doc then. But which was actually formally described of before. By by ripple as Bob is go about it. Not all the more that we found already had a name. This big mouse MOL I for example. Did not have a formal name was not a scribe a ripple and also not by later office. So we had to make up a new name. And that was Bob's make a start with the four with formally also the name of the authors which includes myself. And the year. Of publication. And it's called Bubba's mega-star means a very big and stole my means mouth. But then. At the end of the nine hundred ninety S. some real sustained systemic this TZ. Decided that actually this genus bobbers was not the proper way of describing all these species. I had decided that all African a large Baba's like speciation. Should be. Included in a separate. Genus name and. Actually in that. Jane Jane is also lobby Obama's neck was included and that was a species that already was described by. Ripple. And according to nominate your names. Rules. This means that this. Old name. Had to be reinstated. So all. Large African barbers became lobular barbers while four before they were called barbarous. Meaning that the. Binomial names of these species change again. From barbers go to lobby or Bob's Gorgo Ari and. From barbus megastar to lobby about as megastar. And as soon as the genus name changes. It means that the author. Name becomes you have to put that in between parentheses. Something similar. But actually also the other way around. Happened to lobby. And the call is the return of law because this is the name. As which it was described to be about is not yet eighteen thirty five. But his name was considered. Not valid for a very long game because first of all. Labia Bob's was considered. Artificial. And it was pooled with other species into Bob's Netgear with the name of rouble. Again. In parenthesis because the genus name changed. That was nine hundred eleven. Then the nine hundred seventy three. Bannister true everything together and this species was included in Bob's intermediates then we came. And we call this. Initially we call the lip. Or flap lip. Because of his lips. But we decided that actually bar business. Was a proper name. But within parenthesis. And finally. In two thousand want the reinstatement of the genus labia Barbour's and. The name begin. Became again. Lobby about ripple eight hundred thirty five. Without parentheses. So the old name. Actually returned completely.\n",

Because by the first the description often starts with a species list. That's the first thing that we do. Also the relationships between different species. And knowing which one is related to the other is important for studying. Evolutionary relationships. And also for the Study of ecology. Which one. Each what you have to describe the species that are involved in such processes. And finally. If you want to manage resources for exploitation. Or for conservation. You need to know what you're actually dealing with. So what is this. Systematics Exactly. It can be defined as the signs of naming and classifying organisms and investigating their evolutionary relationships. And history and such relationships and history. Can be reflected in what we call a phylogenetic tree or cladogram systematic includes several things. Among which are the decks on the me and that's the theory of the practice of describing. Identifying and classifying the organisms and. The name taxonomy comes from tax on. Tax on is the singular is the plural. And ducks on. Is a group of related organisms. The most well known toxin that we know is the species. But there are also higher order talks and they're all related to each other. And the best known. High or the dockside that we know are. The mammals birds. Reptiles and figurines and fishes. That's in traditional. Taxonomy. But we'll see later. That this probably is not the best way of naming these organisms. Because an anomaly but that's only me should also reflect. The father genetic history. Of these of these organisms. Next to the relationship between York is of course Orthodox have to be named as we said before. And this. Signs of naming is called nomenclature. And is not just giving a name there's lots and lots of. Complicated rules at that show that as well. That the economic. Name giving. Is actually been introduced the modern variety of it by. Colorful only native Swedish. Scientist who later. Latinized his name into the holy name is and. He published a very very famous book. This is Stayman the Turei the system. Of nature and in this he introduced. What we call the binomial nominal each of them binomial means two names. And that means that each. Formal name of each species consists of two parts. First of all a genus name. And then. A part of the name which is the species name. Within the genus. The species and genera. Are combined to get in high order groups. And those. Again. In still high order groups. Creating a nested hierarchy. System. Why is this all important well. Communication is one thing. This very well known fish that occurs in the whole of Europe and around Europe. Is indicated by many different names depending on where you are and which species which are language that you use. And also the place where it's caught. Actually the name. The formal name. As introduced by the names is as follows. First of all we start with the genus names in genus name called Becca. Which is capitalized. Then the species name within the gene is given. Flu via Tillis which is always not capitalized. And both names together. Are put on the line so you can distinguish it properly. From the normal or common names that you have in a text. It's always let denies or in Latin for example Becca is just the last. And what for birch and through Yardley's means of the river. So we're actually dealing with the river Birch. As always in Latin a Latin eyes although the linguistic. Quality of these A name is often debated. Formally a full species name. Also includes the author's name. And the year of the scription like for this one. Back of the Atlas. Which was this great. Scribe barely knows himself. In seven hundred fifty eight. As we said before taxonomy reflects follow genie and if you look at the modern phylogeny a modern reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the vertebrates. It looks a bit like this. All that that's reports. Meaning and to be as reptiles birds and mammals. Are in this. One group. And if you think about what we all call fishes or by seas. That is this large group. So if you are consistent. And your name giving is actually reflecting the evolutionary history. Then we ourselves like other mammals are just a special type of terrestrial fish. The consequence of naming. Each song by a hierarchical tax on by a by a proper name is that you get a very large range of all different types of names. Because every split in his file a gram. Needs a different name. The thing is that we don't always use all these names but there are a number of them. Which are actually. Obligate story. Like the file of the class the. Order the family. And of course. The genus and species. The basic units of in a system.\n",

                "text": "Fish exhibit enormous diversity in shape. Some of them are quite standard like the common garb. The one here in the middle. But others can be quite bizarre. Like this something. Over there on the right. Or the Seahorse that we all know quite well. But also things like the oarfish which is enormous and has a really strange shape. To get to grips with this type of variability. We need to be able to describe this diversity. Diversity and shape particularly. To do that. There are many different ways. One of the ways is to do it in a qualitative way just describing stuff like the absence and presence. For instance in this sea lamprey. A joyless fish. There are no. Paired fins no. Spectral fins and the Nobel Vixens in the belly while in this dragon that. To the right. You see very clearly here. A picture of. Belviq Feehan. And here. A better off in. On both sides. So this absence of presence can be very important. To describe the diversity. You can also do it in a. Another way you can just say. Or this is a kind of a fat fish or stout fish. Or there's a long and slender fish. But you can also do it in another way saying OK. This has a large or small. Character of one kind or the other. For instance. This fish like fish has a very large body depth. In contrast to this Barracuda now which has a very small body depth. And the same thing with the head length. The head length in this bar is like fish is very short. A small head length. While. In this Barracuda now it has a large head length. You can also count. Characteristics of fish. We call them the wrist ics. As an example. There are two card like fishes here to the right there's again. The common Garp and here is a blue Bream. A species that occurs in the middle Europe. And you can count. Particular things like for example the number of scales. The number of scales on the lateral line here for. Example. A characteristic which is often. Counted in fish and. This number of scales on the left for a lion cub is much smaller than the number. Here in the blue Bream. Another thing goes off and counted is the number of fin rays and Fin rays are these. Supports. Of the fin. Well this is the. Anal fear in the blue. BREAM. There are many more. Finra rays in the end often than there are in the common cup. And the opposite is true for the dorsal fin. The back fin if you like with few rays. In the blue BREAM And many rays here in the comic up. To take the quantum description one step further you can also start measuring things in fish. And if you do that and you define it well you get very reproducible results and you can actually measure many different aspects of the shape. Also quite quite complicated shapes in fish. And he has just an example of the many things that you could measure but you can think of many more. And when you do that. The big advantage of that is that you can get hard data. Hard data that can actually be quite reprehensible. There's a kind of objectivity and that's what it also does it gives you the opportunity of doing. Advanced statistical analysis. Like multivariate analysis. You can see that for example in this example these are. Well quite unknown fish I must say these are snow trials from the Himalayas. And as you can see the differences in shape are not big but they are consistent. And by doing this type of multivariate analysis you can get that. Quite subtle shape differences. Actually out of the original data. Of the measurements.\n",

                "text": "There all this video clip will be about interaction. So who has a question. No one. And luckily I cannot have any interaction in video but it also happens quite often that there is no response when an audience. Is present. If there is any interaction at all in the presentation. It is true. Interaction is not easy but it also has a lot to do with the preparation. Today will go quickly through different forms of interaction and mention some points of attention. Still no questions. What interaction we mean to communicate of process of acting with the audience. You can even share eye contact on that is but. We will not discuss this in this video. In a presentation interaction as an important role. We want to connect to the audience and keep them engaged to get our message across successfully. What better way there is then to let them take part in the presentation itself and. Activate them. When interaction with the interaction the audience has an active role to play. As to read you think and process information. And possibly even apply it immediately. The downside. Is of course that you lose control over the content with the risk that your main line of thought gets lots. This is not what you want. Many times you still have an idea about what message you want to convey. And that's of course. The input of the audience. It's your call and direction also takes time. Which you could have use for explaining an illustrated. Using interaction. Is there's always a trade off between your possibly. To convey information. And the engagement of the audience. However realize that the audience. Only remember a limited amount of information in general. And by interacting you can immediately connect your message to the case of your audience. And this requires some skill. And therefore practice to create useful interaction. And make it a valuable addition to your come to. But let the. But you're down. Already to approach this of trying is a lot of fun. And normally appreciated by the audience. The different forms of interaction we go through our questions. This question. Exercises. And you more questions only easiest but still a very valuable form of interaction. And easily breaks your stream of words is a break for you as a presenter. And a chance for the audience to participate. Although maybe only a small part of the audience dares to answer. Or ask questions. Also others. Value the input of their federally since there are different questions to ask. But the key is to ask the right question. At their eye and moment. And then wait. Asking a question to your audience means that you have to you that they have to think and. Thinking takes time. Therefore be prepared to give them some time which means remain silent for a while. The other side is asking the right questions. Do not make them. Too difficult at first but also not obvious. The first type of question is to rethought a question. Easy one isn't it. Be asking such a question you asked the audience to think about something without expecting them to react. It is useful because you give the feeling that the youngest part of the presentation but in a best of form. So that you as a presenter. Keeps the initiative and doing a dad and expected surprises. Be careful not to put too many questions in your presentation. That it becomes too repetitive. Close questions. Are already more active in for the outings they do have to respond. Everday cannot create the answer for themselves. But have a choice of limited options. It remains therefore easy to answer and remains low entry price a separation for the. Have you. And it is easy to focus on the answers questions could be hung only Bill Oddie. What side you to choose in a certain dilemma our discussion. What kind of experience today have to turn and active. An effective way spalling. Who's ready for some interaction going to see hands. It gets even more interesting with open questions. This really requires active participation. And the audience had to show a little bit of themselves. However when they do not feel secure. Or are off. Afraid to feel for you as a presenter or. The fellow listeners. Open questions will likely get a little response. And hear you as a presenter have an important role. You set the stage and atmosphere. It neatly let them know that questions are appreciated. And make sure that you are accessible and open. And that you. And the audience didn't mean to be just someone on the show or her reaction. Once you have the right atmosphere. Ask the right question this means the right level of difficulty. A very clear in an ambiguous. Question. A possible use marking or. Controversial question. This takes preparation. So think about what question you want to ask. And how you will do this before hand. The good thing about. Open questions is that you can get. In-depth information about what the audience thinks and feels. The information and this information is precious because once you notice. And you can connect your message to the thoughts and feelings of the audience. You have to Hooked. The difficulty with. Open questions is that. At any information to the presentation. You have to do with it. Sometimes very valuable. Sometimes not what you want. Go into the information that is useful for your goal. And be honest when you want to do something else to get out of the audience. But recognize and appreciate every action. You get from your audience. It can take a lot. Of time when people are taking over initiative to try to prevent this. And politely intervene when. It takes too long. And general. Think about what you want to do with the information. You get from a closed or open question. And what reactions you could get. Is important to think what you can do with the expected results. How to connect these two in your main point. But also to think about what other reactions you get so that you never are. Card of guard thing keep the initiative. Where you connect the information to your story it adds value. If you ask constantly questions. Just for asking questions people notice it. And it becomes counterproductive. Then a discussion. It's a forum which gives the audience to chance to really exchange their opinions and interpretations. Disconnects the audience with each. Each other and. You as a presenter. Becomes part of the audience as well by desex change and adaptation process that's going on. Jointly meaning and around the topic it's created. This means that the meaning of your information largely depends on the discussion. However on the other hand it immediately. Connects with the audience. Of course distill room to steer us to present or are still the one who is leading where the discussion is going through this direction. Steers the meaning making process. Only you cannot completely control it anymore. You are facilitating in such a way that it still connects to your goal but leaves room for individual interpretations and. Adaptations. It is also a check whether the message is interpreted in a way which resonates for you as a presenter. Good for them or bring up new information which is relevant but you did not think of or did not know. In this way the audience helps. Thinking your message. Controlling in facilitating such a process for guys to be strict on time. Asking the right questions. Focus on specific topics you want to discuss. And. Intentions. To how the individuals are participating in the discussion can quickly happen the dominant persons are taking over discussion. Or leaving office. Even less engaged than. When you would be talking. So be sharp on including in making room for everyone's addition and opinion. At the end. Do not forget to summarize the discussion can become fussy. And it is your tough to get the main points out. And summarize these discussions going to help in different forms. Which trip through said comes to debate. But more useful in your presentations might be discussion in small groups about the questions you asked the audience. An open discussion can be integrated easily in different parts of your presentation. Make sure that it stays focused. And what your time. Exercises. Can only be included in long presentation and it's quite a specific form so we will be short about it. Exercises are a great way to let the audience experience your message. A spirit is a very powerful tool to make something memorable and helps to internalize the information. The listener is not a listener anymore but a participant which has to apply the knowledge. Given to him or her. As a presenter it's crucial that your intersections a very clear. Be specific about what you expect from the participants in. Actions and I'll come. Afterwards really take time to reflect on the exercise that connected again to your message. When this connection is made. The experience becomes connected to your message and there were many that always keep the fun part that's the last fright. You murder. Everyone likes you most but for everyone it's different. The great thing about humor is that it connects so easily it just always works however it's very difficult to force it into your presentation. You kind of have it or not. What you need to remember if it doesn't come so easily to you and. This includes a lot of people. At. Is that people want to laugh. They're always searching for reasons to laugh. So you do not have to make them laugh. But just create this some room for you Mary. Let them laugh not make them. We all know that there is great danger and wanted to be. Us. Because it doesn't work that way just comes. Forced you are very quickly feels fake. So only use jokes and humor if you really think it's funny. And if you do it do it. Convincingly. Most importantly. Be in the moment when you are connected with the moment. You know when something is entertaining and funny and do not doubt about it. Once you say. So to finish off. It is important to include your audience. Actively in your presentations always think of. Why you're doing it. And what you want to get out of your presentation and the questions you ask. And there are many forms. Think about what fits your goal and. The circumstances. If there are no more questions. I will see you next time.",

                "text": "Their present. Is welcome to this exciting part of. Presentation skills. Maybe some of you recognize this old man in the picture. It's David Attenborough a biologist who became famous through. B.B.C. nature's series. Of course is active expertise was important but what made him really famous was his warm forest and his captivating way of presenting. Today we talked upon the aspect of style. Style is something which is mainly developed in this covered by doing. The more you present. The more comfortable you feel and the more room there is for your own natural stuff. This takes time and you should not desire to be immediately completely natural or authentic. But your natural style should be the basis for further progress on the path of presenting. This is why we start with it and make you aware of it. So let's have a look together and a coming few moments of style and it's related issue. After that it's all up to you do exercises and present as much as possible. To discover this beautiful part of presenting. So why being natural in a presentation. When I just give a performance. Well first of all it's very difficult to not show yourself. You're communicating with much more than where it's only that which you want to deliver. Are communicated through you as a person. Non-verbal signals are difficult to hide. Especially if you think about how many channels to or are through with you. For through which they communicate and how Steptoe they can be. For example. Your position every part of your body. Every tone and tremble in your voice. And all small movement with your eyebrows. Even most actors try to search for parts of themselves in the role description and not try to be a completely different person. We can even say that you are at your best when you are natural because you do not have to think about yourself at all. This means that there is on the one hand no hesitation or doubt. And on the other hand the full focus outside of yourself. A focus on the context a moment. And then the audience. Therefore you can connect much better. With the things that really matter. When everything fits. And there's no doubt or hesitation. All communicate if generals are in harmony. What you say you met is your expression. Your voice. And your feelings. There's And this is on a very subtle level but people sense this think about it yourself when people really come across as natural. You just tend to listen and watch. This difficult to say why. We all know to use people that feel so authentic. Expressing sincere emotions is of great value because it drives most people in this world. We are looking for emotions mostly in ourselves. But we also have the possibility to feel Moshe's when we relate to others. If you connect in human. In order to be connected the presenter has to convince us that he or she. And his or her message. It's easier. And authentic. If the presenter is able to connect and let us feel emotions. We are willing to listen and. Remember it. So to get back to go again. If we are natural. People believe us. Well let's listen to us and people. Remember. In this way our final goal. Of the presentation is the chief. Namely that the message arrives at the other site. Here are two examples of person with a very authentic style. And this context remain with authentic. That you can communicate. And express yourself on stage as you would do. Off stage. And for example a conversation with a friend. Of course your depth the way of your presenting to the contacts. But still you express the same feelings. In a natural way. A key message is that you should go from the idea to presenting its performing. To the idea and of presenting it's a way of expressing yourself. Preventing is not a performance. In a presentation people would like you to communicate with them as you are. There's always a different audience and therefore you should adopt some things in your communication. But do not adept who you are. So it is the search for how your natural style fits in a context and with the audience needs a set. The fact that you should try to express yourself naturally does not mean that you should not change anything at all. Every situation is different and to communicate your message effectively. You have to be able to adapt to the circumstances. As you can see in these pictures. And now to its food school requires a different approach than a stage like that where everything is aimed at making an impact. And then again. A lecture is different from D.C. It depends on the number of listeners. The size of the room their sticks. Length of time. Visual aids. But also to type of audience and expectations of the audience. Because of these circumstances your depth your no verbal communication. You. Your volume. Your intonation. Your post your. And also your interaction what kind of questions. Do you ask. Do you do access ISIS and What kind of humor is appropriate in this context. Next to delivery also that your content you eat us. This is the way you build credibility. Your logos. This is the way you messages you receive the sound. And your battles. This is the way you connect to your motions of your audience. And your structure. For different contexts different structures work best so choose a good structure. We discuss all these aspects of the livery in content in not a few things. So today we don't touch upon this. The only way to get from performing to expressing is by letting go of the tricks you are used to and fall back on your intuitive behavior. This can be scary because this makes you even or in the beginning. Most of us a little distraction. Early stage presenting. And therefore actually feels unnatural to be natural when present. And so we need a safe zone in the beginning. I mean when you feel safe. And let the vulnerability. In your main open when confront. That with the tricks. And only then you are able to change your style towards. Authenticity. What do we need in order to change our still. First of all. A lot of support and. Positive feedback. These are the most important elements to create a sort of super cool. So do this with your friends but also really with your fellow student. In the coming time. When you feel safe. You ask yourself actively. What are the tricks or Moscow used. On stage. What is typically a performance and what is naturally mean nothing if you try to change everything. Some parts of performing are just fine. And most of the time they're deeply rooted. Just take it step by step and begin small. Begin small by doing something different than you normally would think you didn't know deep before. See how it feels. Just a natural. Not good at all. Or maybe even immediately natural. Only by experiencing you can find out what works and how you can express yourself on stage. Didn't immediately judge just that it feels unnatural to be a natural at the start. When we are feeling awkward. It shows that we are out of our comfort zone. These new experiences means the steeper learning color and more diverse learning. So feel awkward. In the end. You decide what is the way to go. It is your style. You decide therefore what your focus is remember this throughout the course. However it is important to choose focus points when changing your style. Because when behavior becomes specific it is easier to try new things and change. And therefore. In the end to have concrete results. At the start also keep room for feelings and over experimentation. Give yourself some time to decide what you would like to change. We end with a not a great example first NASTAR Steve Jobs. Related to your personal style. He says. The following. Don't let the noise of others opinions do. And you drown out your own inner voice. Have the courage to follow your heart. And intuition. They some somehow already know. And relating to experimenting you also have something to say. Every successful person has failed. Number of times. Most of them. Have filled a lot more debt and then we do. And this is why do successful now. Embrace every failure own it to learn from it and take full responsibility for making sure the next time. Things will turn out differently. So don't try to be Steve Jobs. Yourself.",

                "text": "Hi welcome to this video clip about structure. Structure is a crucial aspect of a presentation. Have you ever listened to a presentation and hardly had structure. How West is. I guess not easy. And it coming minutes that we show you what the basic elements are to create a presentation that now actually fits together and is easy to follow. Let's start with a question why we want structure and common reasons why structure is sometimes lacking. After that will give you some general guidelines on how to structure your presentation. The first question is for who do we have structure. Well of course for your audience but don't forget that it's also for yourself. As a presenter you can remember your content much easier if it's structured in a logical way. With a clear structure or chances to lose yourself in. Relevant sidetrack so minimised. All of this makes your presentation much Muhtar which leads to less thinking and stress about what to say next and therefore you can have more focus. In the moment than for example your audience. Or your delivery. For your audience structure greatly enhanced in the stand ability. And makes it easier to memorize to the audience gets all the information in bits and pieces. And has to make sense of. The core message himself while listening. A lot of the message will be lost. Imagine that you have to think. Continuously about what information relates to what in a logical way. And makes it. Listening. Tiring and on the long run to concentration will decrease. And the other hand. A well built up story helps keeping the attention. Make sure that you have thought about the goal of your presentation. If structure is there to support a school for different goals or different directors who it's best. For example if the goal is convincing. The audience. You need a different structure. When your goal would be to get feedback. What are common reasons for having. No structure. What the first. Is not having prepared any structure. It happens a lot actually preparing a structure it doesn't have to take long and. Improve your presentation tremendously. It helps to make it visual and just make a quick diagram or drawing. And I can reason is that you add a lot of information that you did not prepare. What were you present. This can be because you are. And just tick and you are excited to show everything. And or because you know a lot about the topic and want to be new and. Most of the time does make your presentation. Overly detailed. Remember yourself that. Adding too much information is counterproductive to your goal. People will not get them to just agree for and. If. Because of the overload of details they don't know anymore what the essence is remember. Yourself to stick to the plan and. Billion tricks during a presentation to stay on track. Also nervousness can reduce the structure of a presentation this is mostly because when your focus is on their business. This is less than thinking on your goal and the plan. You do not take the time to see where you are in the presentation endeavor skip or rush through the different stuff. If you notice you forget things. They can moment you breathe deeply. Take the time to keep track of where you are and where you are going in the presentation. So how to build up a structure or structure has to go direct of a presentation where you hook all your topics on. In order to make an organized whole the general outline is the division between. Beginning the middle. And the end. You start with what you are going to tell. The introduction. In this way. People are activated and already have a first idea of what is coming. Then you tell it. The main point. This is deliberate message the content. And you end with telling what you have told. This makes your message stick better. And make sure that the most important information is remember it. Now let's go through these three different parts. And see what we can tell about the introduction is crucial to get the attention. We have this for a spark of interest quite some people find it difficult to concentrate on. The main points. Next to this is this useful to outline what is coming. There's also increases concentration throughout the presentation. We often use interest as a checklist for the different aspects and interaction could touch upon. I stands for interesting. Set it is important to spark interest. Always do this right that the start. There are many forms to do this for example a story. A one liner. A picture or a question. That's what people quickly forget. But what makes the audience much more engaged is in need. Immediately in the beginning make clear why this presentation is important for young those. What is there to gain for them. Sometimes it can be useful to mentioned. Time. Especially in situations where people don't know yet how long it's going to take. For the response it's valuable mentioning because in this way you create interactive it's atmosphere. You desire. If you want to tell your message without interruption still people to ask questions later. If you want questions during your presentation you think invite them to do so. A longer from the start. Gives a higher chance of getting questions. Next didn't meet the reason for the hour insulation There's also the reason why you're standing here. Showing your objective for motivation often raises your credibility by coming across as sincere. If it is a longer presentation with a lot of information. That is helpful to explain the structure of your presentation. This makes it easy is forty are you to immediately connected the dots of information. So check your introduction and all these aspects. And then you know that you did not miss something important. The middle of the main points. Here we mostly explain a message. We leverage on the reasons afternoons and solutions. Still Be concise. We often want to give too much information don't forget that most of the time. The audience hears it for the first time. We as presenters. Also diff to off easily and mixed in too much irrelevant information. Repeating in different words help the listener to retain information better. Also illustrating give clear examples on the main. Points just clarifies and sticks to your audience memory much better. Next a distinct time in the middle to anticipate on the dance. Maybe you want to respond to questions or react to no verbal communication of the. Try to connect with the needs of the listener and if possible remain flexible. At the same time constantly be aware of your goal. There are different structures to explain. The main point so let's look at some examples. And thematic structure or different buyers for the topic are discussed and some things. This is very general an easy to use Dr. Sometimes it can be a secondary structure throughout it. For example a chronological structure. An example of the method structure could be a presentation about chocolate. Where you talk about the ecology of the production. The marketing the health and nutrition aspects. That cetera. When a logical structure is made use of a time. This can be from a historical perspective. But also from a process perspective. For example from the mother and they use. To future use. Or the process from being to bar. The classical story structure is very useful to engage the audience. It's very fit and often. Personal recognizable. Questions that are answered in a structure are what. How where and when the trending topic. Structure is actually a simple structure where something which is in the news is discussed in relation to the content matter. It's possible to start with a news item and then go to the theory. Or the other way around. Starting with some main points. And then switch to the plights case. It's also possible to intertwine them and switch between the news item and the related content you want to share. Around this topic. Last but not the least is descent to fix doctor. It's often used at university in a very clear and effective way of communicating we should start with explaining the problem and the research question. Then the research. Then results are presented and finishes with a conclusion and possibly recommendations or discussion points. Another example of a structure. That isn't covered by that arc of the answer you are doing here you can see you see that she analyzed famous speeches and found a reoccurring story structure in them. It starts with the current situation to what. It's. This could be a problem but it doesn't necessarily has to be experienced as such by the audience at that stage. After showing what is the status quo. The what is. Then what could be comes new more inviting possible scenarios are shown. Returning from. What is to what. Be. What could be. So for the times. So smoothly them transition is made to the future vision. And then with a strong what could be. It's an interesting talks if you want to know more about it. Go to the debt side and watch. So now we almost get to the end of this clip. Likewise in your presentation the ending is important to announce. Let the audience know. It is coming in this way you re gain all the attention for the core message. Once you have the intention. Give a concise conclusion but also a short summary of what you've said think he sends us. In this way. You make sure that all input but. Important information is transmitted. And end with a strong one liner. Or a take home message to make it extra memorable. This could be a connection to your start. A quote a sincere call for action. The connection. Today. With the emotions of the audience. To summarize. We've talked about the reasons for structuring. The main divisions in structure of a presentation. And several types of structures. Most importantly. Always divide your presentation in an introduction. Main point inclusion. You see into a check where all necessary aspects are in there. Choose a structure that supports your goal. And capture the intention that you start and end of your presentation. So I have a good look at what is your style structuring. A structured in such a way that it could be super easy to listen to any future. Good luck with your presentations.",

                "text": "Hi Today we're going to zoom in on the nonverbal communication. We all communicate nonverbally all the time. Yet. We are mostly. Unaware of it. But it actually sounds important signal it's non-verbal communication is conveyed through different channels of which you see quite clear example here in the dark satirical. It's a facial expression. Today we're going to make you aware of the most important aspect of nonverbal communication within a presentation. Because there is no great presentation without. Great nonverbal support. Through verbal communication is about the actual content of the information of our delivery. The rest is nonverbal communication. Nonverbal communication on a witless signals. We continuously give actually a lot of what we think and most of our feelings are expressed through non-verbal communication. You can imagine when the signals are nothing line with the audience and the message is difficult to be convincing with your message. The message will not be accepted when the delivery is not in tune with the actual content. Where your non-verbal communication does not show and yet my passion for example. The audience is not likely to believe that your message is interesting. The same goes for convincing are trusting. When you show a lot of doubt. Nonverbal communication and therefore undermine or support your words greatly if there were signals or another in line with the words. The audience is likely to believe your non-verbal signals. This is because the non-verbal signals you send a much more difficult. Fake and hide. Non-verbal communication this determines whether we believe the speaker. Connect with him. And if we are interested in the presentation. There are different elements in no verbal communication. We won't go into detail but most important for your presentation are you post your. Your stable position. You guessed yours. This means. Mainly what your hand movements are. Your voice. We consider this non-verbal because you can send a lot of signals with your voice. Separately from the. As you were saying. Your eye contact your facial expressions. And your appearance. You find most important that you are aware of the key points of the different elements. So let's go through the different elements of non-verbal communication separately. Post your is more or less what you are stable position is. We do include here a position related to the audience which is of course. Different throughout the presentation. Start by having a stable. Poster. Discomfits confident stand firmly on the ground with two feet. For the ladies be aware that he will scan have an influence on this. Try what feels good. But putting your feet as wide as you sure there is not only a good reference point. Prevent. Crossing your legs or standing. Standing on one leg. Of course you do. Move your balance on times from one feet. To the other. This is fine as long as you do not do it continuously. If you really want to check yourself. Go stand up a state of someone face directly to watch each other and let someone push your little at shoulder height and then see how how your balance is actually the next point of attention is your post you should be open to shows that you dare to be vulnerable it conveys that you are accessible. And confident. And also makes it easier to be active. Try to relax your shortness and put them a little back. Your hands of pride from each other and they question us as much as possible. A question often asked is where do I leave my hands what I do not make us just. Most importantly again. Choose what feels good for you to try some different things to try to keep them a bit lower let's say waist height. Do not put them in your pockets. Or behind your back. Or have them crossed through a main open. Facing the audience as much as possible. If you have a lot of flights try to remember them. And practice pointing at them. Without looking at it. If you have a scream in front of you use it. The last main point. And. Of your post it should be active. Wouldn't act if we don't mean that you have to move all the time. For some people it works much better to stand a little bit longer on the same spot. But you should be able to move whenever you want. So do not lock your needs but Bentham a little bit. At least occasionally taken out a spot that you do not stand behind a desk. With can work is to point something on the other side of the slight. To change the Power Point yourself for example or to take a sip of water every now and then. Being after being active means diversity for the audience and a static presentation. Is one of the main reasons for a lower concentration of the audience. Actually by working on your post you will notice that it. Also influence how you feel. This connection is directly made in that talk of. Amy Cuddy. He shows that there is a direct proof of the relationship scientifically prove your post your. And the amount of distrust around of course you so you have in your body. The next step is gestures or hand movements. Everyone has its own natural style but a few points of attention. Most importantly use and gestures. Guest gestures are not only there to be active but also to support. The presenter in his rhythm as a sad guest you're also enhanced as an opiate buddy post your energy to other parts of your novel communication. The guest is. You make should be supportive. As much as possible danger of making too much. And movement is that they become destructive. The attention of the audience is then going to the handsome step of the words. So supportive guest is on the other hand emphasizing clarify what the words. You say. Think about this already in your preparation. At what time going to certainly make supportive. Gestures and include them in your ears or for example. If you have three aspects to mention you can tell this and show with your hands. First of all. Secondly thirty. How big or small your guesses should be depends on your natural style. But don't make them bigger. They sure the with. Unless you really want. To emphasize something. And noticed small destructive movements like touching your hair. Touching your watch. Or wiggling your feet. Normally if you focus on having a stabilization and making gestures. There's less chance for these movements to get into your behavior or your presentation. The forces in extremely powerful tool X.. When other parts of your non-verbal communication are not distracted. You do everything right with your voice you can be extremely convincing and touching or that suggested. The voice can be amazingly detailed the many factors play a role in this. For now we just focus on getting some important ones in the right direction. Most importantly. Of most commonly people speak. Too fast during. Presentation. Remember that the density of the information. In a broad station is normally much higher than in normal qualifications. Next to it is it. It is new information an audience had is not as knowledgeable as you as a presenter. Things that seem logical to you maybe not so logical or obvious for the audience. There for the audience need to time to think so if you're a fast speaker in daily life. Slow down a little bit. On the other hand. You can also become too slow when information is not so difficult in this case you have to speed up. To keep the attention. The trick is to variance beat it to him and what is important or difficult information that has to sink in and really slow down your pace. And other parts where it's less difficult. And just conveys and if your son speed up. This will vary will keep the audience constantly attentive. Really slowing down means having him break. It is important to take breaks. Is a rest for the audience but also for yourself. You can quickly check whether you are still on the right track or you are doing. The can sip of water and blowing your breath. All of this helps to get you folk. Again on the audience and on your story. It also shows that you're not scared for a little bit of silence. Realize how many people feel upset and just because of insecurity. And a case of volume most people speak too soft. So check yourself. It is of course. Dependent and varies on the amount of people on the side of the room. On the other hand. Talking too loud can be intimidating or creates a feeling of overcompensation. For the people that listen to. Again varying your volume. So to speak softly when you really want the audience to listen. And give some parts more power they're putting the volume up. Intonation is a crucial. It's crucial to make your words sound pleasantly. It's what makes. What makes the voicing. What provides a nice rhythm. On the other hand it can get your presentation very static and that's. Make sure that you vary into own and rhythm. Use a lower voice to add depth. But also the higher dose you just add excitement. Also make sure that you differ in rhythm of your speech. Take for example the difference between a question and a statement it's not always easy to change the intonation. What going to help is to add more. Emotions in your presentation and. Rehearse. Articulation is always something to be careful. Of make sure that people can and stank you by articulating well. We will discuss the components of. I contact. Expression and appearance. Briefing for I can think is important to have as much. I can think that it's possible. Keeps getting through the room and try to make sure you cover all parts of the room. Try to use it consciously for example were slowing down. Saying a bit longer and one person creates a bit of tension which going in the line the importance of your message. But also check how you audience is responding make sure that it's not too intense for it in facial expressions or. Got to control. If you want to increase it sometimes it helps to get the feeling that you act a little bit. But what also works is to make more use of emotions in your story. Focus on the emotions is automatically. Seen in the face and. You will start show expressions. During most presentation it is good to smile frequently. But. But always make sure that your facial expressions are in line with with the matter you speak about for your appearance make sure that the closing is appropriate that your appearance as well kept and that you feel comfortable in your plans. There is one thing. To state about known for communication is that. Variation is the key and you should convey sincerity. So stick to your style and decide what kind of. Nonverbal communication shoots you as a person. Of course it should not be destructive So if you notice some behavior which are is destructive Now think about how you can change his behavior. Into much more supportive communication for the given context of course where you are so have fun communicating. I see you all next time.",

                "text": "Hello. Welcome back. Today I want to tell you about the use of logarithms to estimate relative growth rate when we think about exponential growth and geometric rolls. Not the slightest showing you on the. Very left. If it's which are breeding They're multiplying so it's really applied to crop protection and. It's also very applicable for rusts and I milled use and. Leave diseases in crops. So exponential and. Geometric growth. They issue a constant relative growth per unit of time. So the fundamental assumption for exponential and geometric rolls is equal. However how they are elaborated in time is different to metric rolls this issue meaning that time is discrete. And usually geometric growth is used for thinking and making calculations about populations that have discrete generations for instance. Nematodes which you grow from one year to the next and you consider this a multiplication. Process which has a time stamp of one year. On the other hand. Exponential growth is usually used for. Quicker processes like the growth of a fit populations and epidemics rusts. Milde use. Leave large diseases. Here we think about time as a continuous variable and we get a different equation. So remember. What do you questions were for. Geometric girls. It is that the number. After K. time stops. Delta T. is time stop. Is equal to an initial number. Times. The multiplication factor two to power of K.. So I suppose the multiplication factor is two. Then after one time step it has multiplied by two after twenty two times that's by four. After three time steps four by to eight sixteen thirty two. Etc. With exponential growth. The time process is smooth the number at some time. Is the number of the initial time times each of the power of our times T. and T. can take any value. It can be a fractional value. And it's just multiplied here. And it is in the exponent. So even though it looks similar. Is maybe a little difficult to see that it's the same but it's actually is almost the same. Now both gross processes. Can be made linear by taking a longer atoms. If we take the longer rate I'm. Of this. And we take the longer atom of this. That what we get is that the longer a them. Of. An officer K. time steps. Is the luxury item of the initial number plus K. times. Log of lab. Taking the logs. Makes it possible to. Easily read the log of leaped from a graph where the log. Can be determined log. Often times. Log means ten log. Can also be the natural log. Usually we write. Natural log S. L. N.. Now for exponential growth is very similar. The longer a dim. Of N.T.. It is the longer in them of the initial number. Plus our times T.. This is actually only true. If this is the natural law. That it is our time city. If it's the time log. It's not exactly our time Steve there is the multiplication factor at a slower on the slide. Now if we have data. And we plot the data in a graph of. The logarithm. First this time. We can read. Loved from the graph. And we can read. Our from the graph and that is useful that's why we take the logarithms. And you. Can see from these equations. That you can indeed directly read the log of love. Because it's the slope. And you can directly read. Our because it is the slope. So if you want to get. The laptop. You first must read along from the graph. And then you need to convert it back. So it's either. Tend to the power of the log of laptop or. The power of the natural log. Of laptop. You will. You will try it out in exercises in more detail. But I'm telling you so you will remember it and. Think about it. But be very careful that logs natural logs. Have very similar behavior. But their affect their two point three different. To ten log is always a smaller number than the natural log. So this is how you calculate the log of. Lap time which is the. Discrete factor of multiplication in a discrete process. You can also calculate the intrinsic rate of natural increase are. And he's. The natural logarithm of left that defied it by the time step. And the last point here is that. If you graph has a longer atoms to the base of ten. You can use the rule that the natural log of a number is two point three times as large as the tion log of that number so you can use this equation. Ok to a next sample. Here is a number of. A fits. Which is growing. And this is actually not true data. This is fictitious data. I made the data. Its starting at fifteen a fifth on apply. And it's not supplying by a factor of two. Day and night initially you see nothing. Because this is a linear scale. And then at some point this starts to explode and it will go fairy fast from. From here on. Now taking the logs and. Here I took the ten logs. This curved. Relationship. This linearized. It becomes straight. And you should ask yourself. Oh. Interesting. So it's straight. So I can calculate the slope. But what is the slope. Well. Do you know what the slope. Is you need to look at the equations. And the equation I have here is the equation for two metric rolls. It says that the number. At T. plus K. times delta T.. Equals. Let the two decay times and T.. I take the logs. I applied the rules for logarithms and. What I get is that the log. Of the number author some time steps. Equals. The log of the number. Before those time steps happened. So this IS and T.. And this is T. plus K. delta T.. So this time steps that have elapsed. And then. The log of the population has increased by K. times. The log of lab. So if you would be counting. Time step suppose you take time steps of three days. Every point here is three days apart and. Here is one time step. Story. One time step. Another time step. Another time step. Then in three time steps. You go up by. Approximately zero point nine. And then the increase in log. Population size. Per times that is zero point three. And the multiplication factor would be ten to to power a zero point three. And that is two. This is written here. So this is simply repeating the last equation. And this is what I just said. You can estimate. The longer flap. Is zero point three for a delta T.. Or three days. Hand slap that is tended to power a zero point three. That is to. You completely free to choose a different time stop. If you say I want to Time's up of. Six days. Then your increase in the log of the number. Would be zero point six. And then your. Lapped I would be equal to tended piracy zero point six. And that is for. Now. The slope. That you have. Is the change in the longer a them of and. Divided by the time. That has the lapsed. And that is the log of lap that defied by Delta T.. So if it would be a. Exponential growth process. This is how you would estimate. R.. Unfortunately this is tiny logs. So if you calculate the slope of this line. You would not get off are. But you would have to multiply by two points three to get our. This is coming back in the exercises. Summarizing and this slide is the same as my second slide so I'm just trying to do P.R. here for some rules of exponential geometric gross. Both equations. Issue that there is relative growth per unit time. The equations. Are very similar in the form although there a difference in the detail. And the key difference is discrete versus continuous time. Both gross processes can be made linear. By taking a longer events. And then you can read. The fundamental parameter. From the graph. In geometric rolls. You take a certain time step. You read. How much. The log of population size has increased. And then you make the calculation. Well you say that. The left equals turn to the power off the last lap that you can read or it's either the power of the. Ellen lap. That you can read. Depending upon what a logarithmic axis. Was used. If you want to have the intrinsic rate of increase are. You have to use this rule. You divide. Element of luck. By delta T.. However if your graph is in log T.. You still have to multiply it by two point three. OK so. So far. This little clip. On the use of logarithms. To estimate growth rates. I hope it is somewhat clear at this point. But I'm sure you have to practice just to be proficient in using these roles. Good luck.",

                "text": "This clip will be about Beldin. Team rolls. We all have a unique combination of gifts. And when working together in a team. You hope you have a good combination of gifts too was the goal you want to reach together. Dr Meredith Bell been seven years of research. Looking at teams that are working together. And he identified nine different styles of working. These out in nine different styles of working. And you will. You will make a test to see what would be your preferred style out of these nine. Only the expert that's why is it in between brackets. Is the style that. You cannot identify with the test because that's a specialist that only works at a narrow front. Like a specialized scientist for example so it's difficult to get that out of a test if you are an expert on not. But for the other eight rolls if you do the bell test. Then you can identify Well what is an official and unofficial role you. Inclined to take up in a team. So what. What do what rules fit you in a team and what roles do not fit you so much in a team. And we're not talking about. Official Rules here like a leader or like the manager of a team or a secretary but it there. Unofficial roles roles that you tend to take up. Because they fit your personality and. These nine roles are stereotypes so they really show. Like the full version of. What you could show. And maybe you're only part of that. Do type and part does not fit you. Beldin. Really came to the conclusion that you need all these nine roles in a team to function well as a team. And that depends also on the with place of course so if you work in a in an area where innovation is not so important what you really have to do the work. To to implement and to just finalize work. Then some rules might be of less important the creative rules. And in some areas you might need. Creative rules a lot like if you are detector you want to build new plans then maybe some rolls you need more but generally for teams. Having all mine rules and teams make a team. Run more most smoothly. So we can't all be the professor we also need a good secretary and these roles identify these this. This team role does identifies actually nine of these types of rules. So I will go through them all and we start with the plan and the plant is a thinking oriented role you have also to monitor or evaluate her. And we have to expert there all three thinking oriented. Types of personalities you can see. The plant. Is Called plans. Because actually is good at forming ideas and. You have to give it water. So these ideas can flourish and grow. A plant is creative and imaginative. Innovative and open to the new generally. Capable of solving complex problems and coming up with new ideas. But is not always able to communicate these ideas very well and. Might be superficial when making plans in in superficial in the sense of being not always that. Realistic. Sometimes a plant is introvert so it has a lot of ideas but. What has a problem sharing them. So a plan needs to get what you could say so if you have a typical. Plan type of person in your team. Do not forget to nourish the ideas that person have do not forget to give also strange or new things. To give it a bit of an attention you will keep the plans. More happy in the team. And you might come up with really bright to new or innovative ideas for for your project. So use. The plans and what are the ideas you could say. That's the planned rule. Another thinking oriented. Personality would be a money Tory evaluator. That's a person that sober instant she Jake. Is as good analytical capabilities. Critical and sharp when monitoring in a value. Getting the work that needs to be done. And takes time to make choices. So it's very good at having. Having an overview. But sometimes Lex and Susie has some Lex creativity. Next ability to inspire others. Maybe sometimes too critical. So it's a money door evaluator meets a plant that might think like oh my god that's too weird because and it would end. So there. How can a monetary value wager stay open. That would be the challenge. Yet it's great to have one in a team because you get so good. Such a good analytical overview. According to data that's there. There. It's a people oriented role. And there are two two roles coordinator and shape of that you could say. Are mostly those sort of. The leader leaders in a team that. Are naturally good at leading a coordinator would be a. People oriented leader a really very good at seeing. What are the skills of everyone in the team and how can we use these skills very much. How can we use all these competence is really connecting with the people in the team so it's a people oriented leader. Confident mature good listener. Clarifies goals promotes decision making. Yet sometimes maybe. Obsessive with regard to goals. And too focused on discipline and rules. And sometimes so good at delegating that. It does not leave any room. To do any work for him or herself. Then we have a team role. Teamwork or. It's also a people oriented role you could say the strongest people oriented person. Because of his sensitivity. It's a good listener it promotes unity and harmony in the team. It's accommodating it's often the glue in a team it's the person that brings the pies and ask how are you. But doesn't like. Conflict so much avoid sometimes personal confrontation a bit soft. And not always sharing his or her opinion. Then we have a resource investigator. Also people oriented. A resource investigator. Is extroverts communicative lice do you build networks likes to get. New Idea is collecting knowledge and information. And is very sociable. But sometimes Let's focus. Can get lost in networking and always won something new also if the first. Fun is gone out of this new things are gone. Then we'd like to step over to something new again. Then we have a shaper that's the other leader. Type. Next to the coordinator but. It's a leader much more. To woods. Content. Directed to is the content of the work. Is often dynamic. Responds well to challenges like strong ideas. It's a task leader. Sees what needs to be done has a clear line. Yet sometimes because of the clear line. Impatient ones people to follow him but not others might be a bit less quick in thinking or a seeing a different line. And sometimes impulsive. So a shaper as. Has sometimes need to to take a take a step back and wait for others to see if they understood his ideas. It's an action oriented role. Implementor is also an action oriented role. But it's much more the person that Tunes ideas and plans. Into practical actions. Or work or you could say disciplined reliable does what needs to be done a good organizer a vision and sometimes maybe inflexible and unwilling to adjust because you're actually doing the work and. You don't like that something changes that much so once you're on your Tosk. You want to finalize your task in the same way. Where sometimes. We need to be flexible. Completes a finisher. Is an action oriented type as well. And thrives a bit more on nervous energy like should we get the deadline are we are we doing well. But it's very consensual so it's a person that really checks detail searches out the errors. Delivers on time. So with a complete a finisher you're sure you will make it. Until the and. Yet this person for himself might worry too much about the results and. Might be reluctant to delegate. Because it doesn't trust that others will be as precise as you are. So these are the nine. Bellman team rules. And imagine now what would happen. With the team for example full of team work as so not so well balanced team. Well. With a team full of team works you might have a lot of fun and might be great to work together. Because it's all cozy and Nigel and harmony. But you wonder well what will happen with the end result will you really reach the goals will you implemented. Do you. Are you very innovative. Do you allow for different opinions in a team. So only teamwork us might not benefit the team. Same would be with a team full of shapers you might have a lot of content driven persons in a team. But if they all want to shape in a different direction. There might be. You or leaders of a team. Then you might have too many leadership capabilities and there might be frictions. In the team. So a nicely balanced team often. Is is working best. Fortunately we have. We have a tendency to be flexible with our roles. So we often have not only one. Stereotypical role in ourselves present but. One two or three. Dominant roles. And one or two roles you hardly have. So depending on the type of team if you enter a team and you're for example a strong shaper but somebody else is a way more stronger shaper. There's a tendency you will really. Tend to go to your second dominant role for example if that would be a monetary value you tend to start to do that so we balance out. In that sense or. Our first and second roles in what is necessary in a team. So that is. That is good news. So if you would analyze your test results because you're going to do a better team will test look at your highest and lowest scores they tell the most about you and your strengths and qualities. That come forward in a team your scores. Can change over time though. Often your highest and law. Score stay high and low over time. Yeah they can change depending on the team needs. And also on depending on how well you know yourselves over time maybe your own. The view on yourself changes. It's a tool also to define the strengths and weaknesses of the team. So if you. If you get the. Scores of all individual members of the team together and. You add them up you can really see like hey together we have maybe lots of plants in the team so we might have a creative team. But. We have no completed finishes so we lack maybe the skills to really finalize before the deadline in a punctual minute. Manner so if you find out that you have a disbalance team. Before you start working together then you might think of interventions. Already. To over well to overcome this. This weaknesses. For example for a team without complete finishers make sure you plan. Up till the deadline. Make sure you hold people responsible. To get out the errors. To get out to be precise. Up till the end. That would be one solution. You can imagine any. Lots of different types of teams needing something that they like within the team. So as a conclusion. Belding share. Who you are awareness of the differences. Decreases chances of conflict so also read well the description of the other roles and you start to understand better that. Yeah. You. You look from your perspective with your strengths and qualities but. Some other people might have other qualities and strength. That are also very beneficial. Fishel because all you can say all minerals are equally important. Use each other's strengths and identify weaknesses and think of solutions for the team. In this way. You know. Hopefully work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible together to reach the end goals you want to reach within your team. Good luck with it.",

                "text": "The rows of Larry. A company geisha model. The rows of Leary's an interaction model that came from psychological research. About the behavior between people. And I'm going to explain this model to you with the goal of increasing your awareness of behavioral patterns in team interaction. And possible interventions that you could take. To it's working more effectively together. The Rose of Leary is a graphical re presentation of the assumption that certain behavior evokes. Certain behavior. To Siri was developed by theme to. Timothy Leary. Who looked at behavioral patterns. He tried to find patterns in the interactions between people. Since you work in a team. This desirable to communicate effectively and pleasure we. With the help of the model. We can enhance our awareness of the interaction patterns that often occur between people. We can use the model. As a reflection tool. To look back at certain situations. We can analyze what patterns we personally often get caught up in. And with the model. I'm going to show or end with the model in the back of your mind. You can be able to in the moment. Move to communication. Into a desired direction. Well enough about. Said about it let's have a look at the model. This is the model. It has two X. is above and below. And opposed and together. So. Above and below is about the relationship. To others. So. Above. Behavior is more competitive it's more dominant. Behavior you could say. Below is a more submissive behavior. Above behavior would be. With a stronger voice with more eye contact with more presence. Below behavior would be smaller softer more gentle more asking. So that's the difference between the. Above and below of the vertical axis then we have a horizontal axis. And that is being more opposed of being more together. So Poso. Main that you're thinking more of yourself. And together. Wouldn't. That you're thinking more of the team so you're more thinking of I. In relation in relation to the team or you're more thinking of we. In a team. And that. That makes the four axis and then you could place. Different types of thing. Different different. Words in it you could say so leading would be more an above. Or way of dealing with things helping would be more together more above together. Then you've got co-operative behavior independent behavior. That is more below behavior you could see that's more. Soft spoken you're more following. If you're more opposed then it would become withdrawn or defiant and. If it's more about it could become aggressive. Are competitive. So anything you could say. You say you could play somewhere in this model. And the way you say it makes all the difference so you can say it loud you could say it soft. And that would make a difference in where you would place what you do or how you behave. You could play somewhere in this in his model. So it really makes a difference your tone of voice your jest as your volume. On where you would say if you're more leading or if you're more helping. If you're more competitive. Or if you're more withdrawn. For example. If you would talk about the color of grass in your team together above. The upper right quadrant. You could say something like. I think we can all agree now that grass is blue. So that would be a buff together move. Opposed above the upper left quadrant you could say. So what are you talking about grass is green. That would be more competitive reaction. Together below. That's the lower right quadrant you could say well which. Which color do you think Ross has what. According to you what do you think what is the color of Gus That would be more a cooperated more dependent remark. And opposed below it would be well on the lower left corner it would be. Well I don't care about the color of grass and actually grass is grass and grass is green. So you could summarize it. Also with using these mood clouds. Saying while leaving is more about it follow me. So it's an attitude of Follow Me and anything you say or do you. It could be. It could be airing follow me. It could also be support I support you aren't a co-operative would be. We work together. Depending would be I will follow you and withdraw would be well leave me alone. I'm alone in this I don't want to do this or I'm I'm not afraid defiant. But you're not seeing So you're not you're not showing that that very actively. Aggressive would be a. Well. Be afraid of me and you say it in such a way that others maybe get frightened and competitive is why I know better. So you should listen to me so it's more along. So that would. With this in mind you could place any interaction. In this model. So why is this model so interesting. Well. Let's have a look at the following. Over here. You see. Again. The quarter and with the dominant submissive The opposed them together behavior and. Different. The different styles of interaction. And you could say their research shows and you can say that some behavior leads to other behavior for example if someone is more competitive. It often leads to an aggressive. Reaction. So I think it's like this don't you think it's like that and then somebody else says no I don't think so I don't agree. So competitive. Behavior often leads to. Aggressive behavior and vice versa. Or. If people feel more threatened. They start to leave. So competitive behavior can also lead to. Withdrawn. Behavior. It's like OK he's so competitive and he thinks he's are so right I'm leaving the scene right now. So competitive behavior can lead to either aggressive behavior or. People withdrawing. Aggressive behavior. Aggressive behavior. Leads to defiant behavior. So generally you could say if you're very aggressive others might say well I'm not afraid of you. You can say what you want. But sometimes they might not even show it. So aggressively as to defy and so that's a pattern of interaction. On the other side there are also patterns of interaction leading behavior leads to dependent behavior you can imagine that I'm leading but I have no followers is nobody. Wanting to follow me. That. Basically there's no. No way for me to be that dominant anymore. So it's very difficult to stay dominant. If I have no hope no ones who would like to follow me you become dependent. So leading it leads to dependence. OK I will follow you. Dependent persons and dependence lead on somebody having to step up to lead. So this is an interaction pets and you see often as well. And often you see that helping. Leads to cooperation. So it's also a pattern. You often see if I help you. Then I corporate A.I.B. corporative and then you probably will help me. So these patents you see back and any type of conversation very often. And in itself. Again. It's sort of a net. It's natural interaction between people what can you do with it why I can this model be helpful. Well if you're in a team and you see for example people and this endlessly discussing. I think it's like this I think it's like that. I think it's like this. Then a way to step out of this type of conversation. Is stepping from a post to I more to them. To gether side. To the we. So if there are people in a competitive mode. The way to get out is to start naming things in we so. Well you say this you say that. What do we think. For example. Ask a leading question. So you move from this. I to we. The direction to with that. So. If you notice this type of behavior and. Even stronger it could be if. You move from this type of behavior if you see this happening competitive aggressive. You move from this type of behavior to Woods. This area. Actually taking a different type of die before tone of voice. So if somebody says like I think it's like that. I think it's like that. It's very difficult to keep that energy if somebody asked to explain me maybe a little bit more about this so that. So taking a co-operative or dependent stance often leads immediately to a different atmosphere. And therefore getting people more on the weak side again. So having this in the back of your mind you might think. And you see something happening like this behavior. Think of how could you get people. Again. To the WE side. By either becoming a bit more submissive. Having a soft tone of voice. Is inviting others to also take a different type of voice and asking questions is also inviting them to be heard in a different way. So that is one way. With this. It can also be. For example if you're the leader. And you're leading all the time you say xterm do all the work all the time. So then you're in the leading mode. And the others don't do anything. Then. What you could do as a leader if you want others to step up also is just step down a bit. So if you step down a bit. With leading. Dependent people have to step up. Somehow. Because that's a natural balance. You cannot. If you lead strongly. You need strong dependent people if you lead more into helping We others have to become more cooperative. So. And they all the way around as well if you're often very dependent on a strong leader. The way. To become less dependent or more active yourself is to step up to move up to it's corporative. And that will make a leader maybe. Stepping down. So this is our this our pets and you could discuss in your team and say hey actually Who is he the most leading type who's the most dependent. Do we still want it like this. So you could. You could really. With the help of the. Model discuss your patterns of interaction. Then. The last if somebody is over here defined withdrawn he doesn't want to be there. No use. Also moving for example to this place to get the person out of there can be very helpful. Like how are you doing or I see that. You're not to agreeing. What is going on with a friendly tone and in a wee space inviting them back again. To the other side. So with this model you could say. It makes. Makes you aware of what is actually happening and. You might be more aware to make comes to choices of getting people back to. Well to do The together side. If necessary. Now it's not always beneficial to be here because you also have groups that are very much into helping cooperative helping cooperative they're all very nice and smooth and. But actually. People like harmony so much that differences are not allowed. Then. It is very helpful sometimes that you step up and say actually. I don't agree. I don't agree I think it should be different and we should move in this direction because we're not going to right direction. So any quadrant actually is a helpful quadrant. Depending on where you are. Depending on the time and depending on the needs of the team. So sometimes it's good to move out of the team and say I don't agree with this. And maybe then move back and say So what should we do. So go to this ng. So this model can. Can model the way. You can say to to better communication in a team. Well. Where could you use your model yourself the use of the model. Like I said you can use it as a reflection tool. You can analyze pasta to ation with it. So. Reminding yourself back of some situations maybe that were not very smooth in company cation. You could map out. What actually happened and then you might also. Invent a new strategy. To go out. You could also. It's yourself in a preferred quadrant. Maybe your preferred quadrant is often. The defined one law I don't agree or. I am quickly reactive I'm I'm getting in a competitive mode or you are always more on the. We side or the dependent side like I follow the leader and then I'll be fine. So what is your preferred quadrant you could say and do you still want that. Or not then. As a last. You could also use it in the moment. In current situations to things like hey what is actually happening and. What can I do. At this moment to change it for the benefit of the goals of the team. So that's is. Leary's Rose. I hope this clip was useful for you. Roche owes you the interaction patterns. And with this model in the back of your mind you can influence group interaction. Consciously to more effective and pleasurable state. Good luck with it.",

                "text": "Welcome to this clip on listening skills. I guess we all had moments in which he felt truly listen to this builds a bond between the listener and the want to listen to in teamwork. Listening. Is of vital importance for the trust and effectiveness in a team. And also for the amount of joy that you feel in working together. Let's have a look at the vital skills for listening. Actively. And identify the most used listening style you tend to take up for yourself. The biggest company cation problem is not that we do is we do not listen to understand we listen to reply. This is a quote of Stephen Kovi. He's a company cation girl really works a lot. In different companies. And actually. He sees a lot that people. Basically tend to react. A lot. But not always try to really understand the other and a lot of his work. Is dealing with with that issue. Getting people to listen to each other to truly understand the different viewpoints. With active listening. We listen. With the intention to understand. Yet how often do we really listen with this intention. Often we are already busy formulating a reply. Giving our own opinion on the subject or waiting for the things we would like to hear ourselves. So then we're not really listening to understand for the other but we want something out of it ourselves. So the first. Attitude to listen well should be listening. With the intention to understand the other shifting your perspective from your own ideas or viewpoints to the perspective of the other. Trying to understand it from his or her viewpoint. This takes energy and time. It will save your energy and time later on because it diminishes the chances of miscommunication. This is a Chinese character. For active listening that illustrates it very nicely what it's all about. It says you've got. Ears to hear so listen carefully. You've got ice to see. Because a person is not only speaking with words but also with this. Tone of voice with his gestures so all his non-verbal communication. Look at that as well give a person your undivided attention to focus that's the blue line so focus on the person. And you've got to hard to feel what the person is actually saying maybe underneath the words he's sharing. And you've got a mind to think of well what what what is this about to understand what the other is saying but also to come up with with a wise response. So. Use all. Use all your senses in a way to listen fully to someone else. It really uses your full attention and takes a conscious effort. Listening is actually a skill that you can train. Another aspect of listening is summarizing. And it's an important aspect of active listening because you. With summarizing you stick to the story of the other. By giving it back to him or her in your own words. And it has three. Positive effects. It actually checks. Summary designed to stand you right. It's also a mirror is just what you said. Is it correct so a person gets back his own story and they might say no no not like this it's a bit more like that. It's also something that fuels a conversation if you summarize someone else. Often opposes Yes this but also and that and that person feels heard. Feels feels that he's being seen that. And often. Positively respond. On that. So. Summarizing is an essential skill. In listening to a person. Because you stay to the story with the story of the other and not. Given your own. Input so much. Then a third aspect of. Active listening is questioning. Einstein had a nice quote he said. If I had an hour. To solve a problem in my life depended on it. I would use the first fifty five minutes determining the proper question to ask. Also part of active listening is asking the right questions to truly understand the other. How could I help him or her forward. What question would help to clarify issues for myself. For himself or herself or others in a team. So before reacting giving your immediate response think of question. To understand the other better for yourself or the team. It gives you a better impression of what the other person knows him or herself already. It gives more clarity about what you might be necessary to explain still. Or you might be surprised by the answer of the other and therefore learn something new. Truly switching your perspective. Maybe this vital information and what your other comes up off to your question that increases the understanding. And that all increases. That improves the effectiveness of. Of of working in a team tremendously by you taking. Well. Asking the right questions. So actually do three keys to active listening and that is listening to understand. Summarizing and digging deeper by asking questions. Since in order to speak. One must first listen. Learn to speak by listening. That is what Rumi said. And we will now. From this go to discuss. Different listening styles. Listening styles you could say. Go into four different quadrants. We hear identifies three four listening styles of course. You could also make seven or ten depending on the model you use but we we we identify four main different. Listening styles and. You could say it moves from giving more your opinion or giving. No opinion staying more silent and it. Could move from thinking more only of what you would like to hear. And listening of what you would like to listen to or listening for to gain more for yourself and for the team and for the other. So it's more two words. I myself centered on more tools to we centered. It's reactive listening. Is the first one so reactive listening. Is. I know the answer is basically what I just said is. You hear the. Story and you think of hey I know this already and then you react to all I have that true or no it's not like that. This. That's a reactive kind of. Way of listening. So immediately responding to is our only picking up those things you think oh yeah. That I also have an opinion on. Then you have passive. Listening often we do that in college when we listen to a long talk with pick up saying things selectively. And then. We dozed off of if it's less interesting for us. So. Thinking of only thing selectively not trying to maybe get the full story but taking those things that interest does most and. Sometimes that's also beneficial. Active Listening takes a lot of energy so. Sometimes a bit more passively listening can do the trick. But in teamwork. I would say. Go more to the active side to the WE side. Then we have active listening and that is something. I just explained. Active listening is listening to understand the summarizing. And the questioning. And really not giving anything of yourself giving not your own opinion. Like it said over here but basically. Really giving. Just trying to understand fully the story of the other. And then we have. Proactive listening and proactive listening. Is is and. Listening to the other to fully understand. And if you have a different viewpoint or you can also say well yes you say this and. What about this and what do you think about this or I think this and you can give your own opinion. So with react if it is. Yes but and withdraw if is yes and. So that's the difference. And then team. In a team. You could say. The more you can move to the WE side. To truly understand each other the easier it is to communicate in the long run. So this was my presentation about active listening. Here saw a small summary about the benefits. Benefits of listening. It takes effort. To do so. So it really. It's a muscle you can strengthen you really have to train to be consciously aware with the other. It builds trust. It improves the company cation tremendously in a team. And it enhances learning a lot. Because you really see many more perspectives than you're only your own. Here's the last calls I would like to end with. Deeply listening to what is within and around us. Changes us. And hopefully for the good. Good luck with it.",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this clip about teamwork. We all have a unique combination of talents skills and knowledge. And you hope that when you form a team to work on a common project. You will perfectly match. But this is not always the case. Clear communication is vital to make things work in a team. I will present you some advantages and disadvantages of working in teams. There are many team advantages. Like. There's a chance to learn a lot from each other and to take up new perspectives. So this is really when you really when you work in a team. You can take up new knowledge. New skills. You see things. How things work from a perspective of someone else. You hear. New knowledge that you might have never thought of yourself about a certain topic. And that really creates a lot of learning for yourself. It's also an opportunity for synergistic combinations of ideas and abilities. So. Teamwork often leads to innovation. Because of this combinations of skills and knowledge and background. You might come up with. Totally new plans. Imagine you would live in a world where you would only be on your own. That would be very weird you have no clue if you would be acting skillfully or not skillfully. So in teamwork this is a big chance of learning about yourself learning about how you communicate what is effective human occasion. And you also get back a lot of feedback from others and that really enhances. Well your self knowledge. Your effectivity. It also is a chance to have a lot of fun together to make jokes to to share and to share the workload in a team so there are many advantages. To teamwork as well. But there's also does it just. There's more organization. There are more discussions. It is time consuming to get into one direction too to see the common goal. This is a chance of conflict. Chance of. Group thinking. So conflicts. Of course when there's a lot of miscommunication disagreements or appointments are not being met them I'd be chance of conflict. There might also be a chance of group think and that is when you start to think so much together in one line that. And you want harmony. So much that you don't dare to think differently anymore. And therefore also the quality of the end product goes down. So that can be some disadvantage. It could also be that you come together but actually you've got. Incompatible background competencies. You don't have matching skills are you all want. Are good at the same thing. And then it's also quite difficult to find the right balance between well who takes up what TOCs what rules are to catch up with what you don't know yet. And. If you have high expectations of your team members but. They might be at a different level. That sometimes also causes frustrations. And then. Company cation again is vital. Evaluation there remain. Rewards may be perceived as less powerful. For the work you're doing. To get to the end product because you might get a team to team Mark. For the end product. At my you might also see it as as. As something that boosts your motivation to work on it because you don't want to let your team down. So it can be positive and negative. Of course you're less flat. Flexible in managing of your own agenda because you have to meet your team members you have to see them you have to make appointments. And you cannot only reach your own goals. But you are together with all this. So that makes it sometimes difficult to work together. So that some advantages and some disadvantages of working in teams will now show you some keys to successful teamwork. And I have to admit. Those keys are more easily shared. Than done. But nonetheless it's good to remind you of it so you can start. In a beneficial way. With with working in your team. Well what are keys to successful. Teamwork. The first one is clear agreement. Mutual goals. Accountability and a desired outcome. So define what your common goal is. If that's your. Bowl being happy then. If that's the common goal then. Find out what. Would all make you happy. But often of course this is not the goal of teamwork. To all become on you happy. But to to deliver a good quality out. Put so know all. What your common goal is and how your desired outcome would look. And then. You all put your noses in the same direction. Another key to successful team work is creating an environment in which the people in the team are comfortable in taking reasonable risks and communicating. Advocating positions and taking action. So the risks. People take in a team to do something. Are to share something. Should be rewarded. And not seen as. Disrupting the harmony of the team. So reward. The risks. In a team and create to save environment. To. Well share commonalities board. Certainly also differences. Team members should trust each other that's vital in a team and it's also shown on research. That if you trust your team members. It's easy. More easily to share differences. So a team member should not punish each other for disagreeing. Different viewpoints are expected. Should be encouraged and this. Builds on the creativity and innovation. Of a team. Communication is open honest and respectful. Listening and questioning are valued so generally. Listen more than you talk. That would be a good rule to take. So what do you actually hear and do you understand what you hear. And check this. And that really enhances also the working together. Strong commitment is needed. And if you feel belonging to a group then actually often this increase is itself your commitment so how can you feel that you belong to a group voice yourself. And develop group guidelines and norms together. So you all feel that this is actually something you're. Taking part of together. Few each other as unique people. There's an intention to take advantage and. Take the intention to take advantages of the different differences. This human trait we have. We like people that are mostly like ourselves because we feel often. Most safe. With ourselves. So. But reaching out to the unfamiliar. In an open way tends to increase effective Efik. Effectiveness and pleasure. Of teamwork. Enormously strong willed willingness to examine yourself as a team and as individuals and a team really builds up in teamwork. So continuously wanting to improve process is practice is the interaction of team members and. Trying to work to as a mutual resolution. That takes really courage to look at what is actually going wrong what is actually going right and where can we improve. And take time for that make space for clear evaluations after. After a team meeting. It takes time but it will save you a lot of time in the long run. And last but not least. It's of course leadership team runs better when there's a clear direction and a leader can help. The way. To show the way to go. So clarifying. Problems and making logical decisions. Persuading people presenting well. Taking positive attitude to the learning of everyone. Etc. So you see here many many skills only a good leader should actually have. But this is not only up to the leader this is actually up to all members in a team. So you can also call it personal leadership. If you all. Listen. Support. And bring in these qualities actually teamwork. Is much much more easy. So a leader cannot be perfect in himself. The leader of a team. If you all. Try to contribute in your own way. Than actually team would go as much efficiently. You could also Rule eight. The toxics use of the official leader. So as a conclusion. Teamwork has many benefits and sure leads to learning. Communication plays a vital role in making it work effectively. And pleasantly. So taking time to discuss the task the procedures the preferred roles the preferred interactions. In the beginning saves a lot of time. And the long run. So I hope this will really help you with starting up your team. And I wish you good luck.",

                "text": "Hello my name is Eric a month. And in this clip I'm going to explain a little bit more. How you can prepare basically the implementation of a project. You have done before Malaysia of the project it's clear what the project will be about. But now have to carry it out. And how are you going to prepare that. How are you going to organize that. So it's usually about academic. Quality standards. So the. Quality has to be guaranteed. You need a good planning. You need a good communication because you work together in a team with different team members from different. Disciplinary backgrounds all. Internationally. And you have to have a budget. And then finally I will close off basically. The possible elements of a certain proposal for a project. This is a very simple picture but it is also crucial picture. It's called a Devil's Triangle. And it means basically. Once the budget is fixed. And you have a time plan. With a deadline. Then the quality. Needs to be insured. So how to reach this quality. Given the time in the budget that you have. That is the kind of attention that your project organization is about. So how to reach this quality. Well then the first step in the initial problem. Project definition. You would define the problem or a knowledge of God that you're going to address. So if that is. Nicely developed a narrow down. That is one step to basically to guarantee it is quality. A good set of research questions. So what is the information you need for your project. What is the kind of doctor you need so good research question. Also helps to reach this quality. And finally of course you have your quality methods for data collection. Remember that needs to be academic. So think back on your courses that you're got your in your order. And your cation. Programs. On research methodology or. Data collection in order coursework. These are the standard study also guarantee your quality. Finally of course it's important especially if you work together in teams that you organize the communication internally. Who's doing what and. What kind of this. Specialist. Backgrounds do people have. And when. Do you need to mobilize died. And also the communication accidentally once in a while you need to come together with your commission to see whether you're still on track. Or whether you need help adjusting to project a tetra cetera. So organizing this communication is also crucial for the quality standards. And finally of course time. Careful planning is crucial. You need to do first things first before you can move on to the next stage of your project and it might seem boring but planning. Is a crucial part of your project organization. Now communication. There is a lot to say about it. Very briefly a few points that you need to think of. And there are many articles literature. About each of these themes. But think about the rules that you're going to play not only the content rules or specialist. Or the disciplinary backgrounds of people. But also the kind of character traits they have a certain. Team members might be the kind of board keris. Or the people. About being good in. Guaranteeing the good atmosphere in your team so discuss these things. Think also about the added value. Group or a team. Can really have added sell you. As compared to a set of individuals carrying artwork. How we organize communication especially if you're not in the same country or in the same city where you work and. By Skype. Or you're meeting physically. How are you going to do that. Take care of production documentation. Are you going to store. Everything you return to find all the data how you're going to share that. Putting it didn't drop box or in Google Google Docs is fine. But how do you really share this information. How are you going to meet. Are you working with minute setting agendas etc etc There might be issues. Along the line. How you can disagree. You can have different views on how to proceed. As a project how you're going to solve these issues. And finally organize communication. Organize it really up to the level of the smallest detail I would say. And also. Organize a communication with your commissioner food already in your proposal or your quotation. Because it's making your. Commissioner or your supervisor. Go responsible. Remember that your proposal is a contract. So the most important that lines. When are you going to send in a draft fruition. Of your final product to your commission and when do you need to feedback back. That is always also very important in. Project planning. And then finally of course the action plan. It sounds simple again. But it is crucial to really put an effort in that. So who will do. What. When will it happen. What types of inputs will be needed along the line. What do you need to finish before you can move to the next step. And I always like to use the model. Basically developed by Henry Lawrence guns. In creating or designing the Hoover Dam in the United States. This is basically how it looks. It means that you list. All the activities. In a table. That you need to carry out for your project and on top you basically put the weeks your project. Will take. Or last. And then on top. You put it it is the ability of your team members. And then try to match it. So certain side visits. They need to happen at the beginning of the project. Because it's important for data collection. Before you can start with the analysis. And if you look at fully at the top where the marks are colored green. That is. There's not enough time to carry out his field fizzes you need to reorganize yourself. Whereas in week six. Where some of the marks are that. There are no activities. But you still have time available. So you really need to make sure that you fill out a form like that in detail. Of course it will never happen like this. But it is a first mapping again. Of your project and. Now you know already. What can go wrong. And how you should improve that. To make it happen rightly. Finally the budget. Again. This is just an example of how you could structure the budget. Put the main items there. Because your activities cost money and. Work out the rest of the bill. That. Also make sure. That's the total of the budget. Is rounded off. I quite often see the. Digitals in the in the total. And of course nobody will ever be able to guarantee that a project cost five hundred sixty Euro and ninety five cents. That is only. At the detail of the result. Basically after your project is finished. This is a very rough example. And again you can find the literature on Internet money order examples. And of course it has to be clear to your commissioner. Are you basically. Fill out and work out on the budget. It's a signature there. This is of course the final contract. And it's also again. A summary of your project you could say. Because here usually are your activities. They come back in your budget. And the final. Amount. Is of course always possible to negotiate down. You can always have money left over but it's very difficult to negotiate it up again. So this is the. You could say the crucial final step. Of your project. Now a few items that might appear in your project proposal this is just an example and of course you need to follow structures that are presented by. Your commission or your supervisor. But this is just one way of thinking about how your project proposal could look like a cover page. An executive summary. Quite often this is more crucial than you would think. An executive summary. Is basically really does summary of your project. So you're easily when you tender on a project. The people. Basically going through the proposals. Have to go through an enormous pile. And usually it is executed summary. Is the first. Selection criteria. If there are spelling errors or is not clear. Then your on pile B. and you don't want to be on pile B. you want to be on a soap a lot of attention to that summary of what's required. Now of course this part is the academic. Core of your proposal. And that is about. The problem analysis. What are you going to achieve the purpose. What are you going to produce what is the output a product. And what other methods basically. To achieve those. So this is the core you could say of your proposal. I don't finally of course. You have the organization of your project. What this clip was about. It's about how you organize your team. What is the added value of your team. How you cope with certain risks. Etc etc. And then in Europe and the seas. You could have all kinds of extras and that depends on the project that you are you have defined. But there you'll find a plan in the budget. References. Literature list. Depending on. Again. The criteria of the project.",

                "text": "Hello my name is a month. And I'm going to show you in this clip. Basically the basics of beginning a project. Any project a research project a consultancy project. Or you might embark on a project quite soon in your education program. The first steps are crucial. You have to make sense of your project. What is your project about. I mean the first step is important. Usually you work on the basis of a kind of terms of reference. Now you gotta. There's a possibility to tender. Or a commission or invites you to talk about a project and usually these descriptions these terms of reference. Are incredibly brought. Which means that there are many projects possible still. Now a few tools I'm going to introduce here. Can help you in. Articulating the project better. First as a problem analysis. And the second one is a stakeholder analysis. But first a definition. And it's quite clear actually. The project you could see is a temporary activity. It's a one time effort. With a starting date an end date. Usually you work with a deadline. Specific goals. Of course you need to solve the problem of a commissioner or. Find an answer to a question. There are certain quality conditions. Usually you work in a team. On a project. Interdisciplinary International. Which means that you also have to organize communication and responsibilities between each of the team members. You say you work with a budget. You have a certain planning. In order to meet is that line. And you have final product. And often. And that is also quite interesting but also complex. You work with multi parties. Stakeholders. So-called. And then the bottom line here is perhaps the most important part of this project definition. If you fail to plan your plan to feel. Well this picture you might know it's all over the Internet. And I like it a lot because it is quite crucial. It shows basically that. It's very hard to talk about the same thing that your call your commissioner. Or your supervisor. Has a certain image in mind of what the project will be about. What the final product will be. You have a certain image as well. You also have a kind of visualization of what the final product will be. But the same applies to all your team members. So it is crucial in a first step to agree. Basically. On what you're heading for what the project will be about. And what the final product will be. And that is. I think the biggest challenge in the start of your project. Now why a proposal or why a quotation. Because you'll come tender on a project or you want to win a proposal of course. First of all you have to convince your commissioner. And or your supervisor. That you are the right team for the job. And that your can actually achieve what you promise. And what you. Conceptualized in terms of your project definition. But it's also important to convince yourself. You also have to be sure that you can carry out to this project. In a given time. In a given budget and with your expertise. I finally. Or thirdly I should say. That is perhaps even the most important one that you have a project that you would like to carry out a project work or your work. Should be fun. And as I sat there are different ways. Of articulating a problem. Project. And are usually many projects possible in this. Broad terms of reference that you've got. So if you can negotiate an articulated in the way that you actually like your project. That is even the best. And finally of course. That is also quite important once you agreed. On the project. You have a contract. It's written down in your corporation or your proposal. Basically what you're going to do. How you're going to do it and what the end product will be. Including a budget. And that's also quite crucial. Now the first tool I'm going to introduce. Is problem. Analysis followed by a stakeholder analysis. Which is basically mapping. It's a mapping exercise. What your project will be about. As I said to you easily get a kind of terms of reference. A kind of vague description of a problem or a knowledge gap. And that is. That is quite normal because if the problem. Would be clear. Your commissioner. Could have solved it him or herself. So that is why. There is always a kind of struggle. In defining and articulating your project. So here is a list of a few points of attention that you want to address. And that you need to discuss within your team. And also later on with your. Commissioner or supervisor. To find you and your project. And the first. The first bit which is quite important is to think. Is a problem oriented or theory oriented. Is there a real life problem. That you're going to address. Or contribute to or is there a knowledge gap. That you need to fill. So why is this project necessary. And then you are discussing the problem. And your objective of your project. The second step. And I will say some more about it in the following slides. That is other stakeholders involved. Other people groups of people that actually play a role in your project will they benefit from your project or. Not benefit from your project. And your output at center etc And then finally of course. That's also something you could think about what could be your contribution to the solution of this problem. Or filling this knowledge gap. Now do a second step is a stakeholder in their losses. And that is basically mapping the different groups of people that play a role in your project. People can be affected by a project or people can influential projects. People have certain interest or power. And that is important to map. And then bear in mind that stakeholders can be individuals groups communities. Anything basically. And it's important to be exhaustive. So I tried to list. In the beginning every group of people that can play a role. Or can benefit from your project. There is a simple frame. To help you here. I wouldn't advise to put it in your proposal but it is a kind of. Mapping exercise within your team. And you can also discuss this with your commissioner. On what kind of groups are involved. And then the most important one is that group of course. Because they have a high interest. And they also have a lot of power. They are usually the crucial stakeholders in your project. So you really have to think of ways in and. Valving them and engaging them in your project. That can also help later on that they are committed in using your. Result. Your output. And then of course. The people who have no interest and no power. They could be invisible even so you don't have to take them into account. Be careful though because they can play a role one shop projects start. People can get more interest during the project or get more power to you in your project. So it is a kind of dynamic. Frame. But it's good to use it as a kind of mapping exercise. You can also certain projects deliberately choose for a certain stakeholder group. And enhance the find your project in such a way. Now a stakeholder analysis as I said is a first mapping of the problem. But what is also important is by doing that correctly. You show your commissioner that you understand the context of. Basically the assignment. The hidden agendas the politics the sensitivities. So you do your homework. And that's also a convincing argument basically for your commissioner that you are the correct team for the job. I finally of course you also come to understand where to get data. Needed to carry out your project. Those are the people. Groups of people that you need to interview. You need to visit. You need to ask them for materials. And that is basically the end of this first step. Of articulating your project. This. First exercise leads probably probably to a lot of extra questions to your commissioner. But finally this helps basically. In defining the project that you want to carry out. For that to finish basically this first face it will always go to formulate research question. Remember this is probably going to be an academic problem. Project. So articulating a good research questions. Basically lead you to answering. And finding the correct data to these questions.",

                "text": "Hi This clip we will discuss some techniques that we can use to measure realistic properties. And we'll look at four categories. We'll look at techniques to measure. Low viscosity Newtonian fluids. Which is the capillary of his commentary which is most frequently used there. We look at. Techniques to measure. Properties of non Newtonian viscous fluids. As a roach of his commenters. We look at. Devices to measure fiscal elastic properties. And finally we look at some devices to which you can use to determine properties of this caustic solids. So we start with Newtonian fluids. And this device here that you see here is a lot of his comet are basically what it does is it measures viscosity. By subjecting a fluid. To flow puzzle you flow. In a very narrow channel. And in a technique. From this basin down here we fill the tube the middle Choop. Up to a certain level. And then we measure the time that the ministers of the fluids. Travels from this point here. To stash line to. Distaff line. And what we typically do an experiment like this is that we calibrate the EVA louder. And that gives you a constant here. A collaboration constant. You measure the time that it takes for them an excuse to flow from this point. To that point. And that is done directly. Given. I give you directly the. It's called City. Of the fluid. To see is actually a constant which you can just calculate from the. Gravity driven flow. In a capillary. This type of technique you can only use for Newtonian fluids. The analysis that gets you this. C factor here. Does. Not accounted for and she had thinning in the fluid. So it is valid for a Newtonian fluids only. This has to be kept in mind. Now for non it's own influence on even this classic materials we have. Wrote of is common to us and control stress with real matters. I wrote of his comment here is a device where we apply. Study. Sheer to a sample of control stress real matter. We can actually also do. Also the Tory experiments. Now we're used to geometries to test samples. This is the. Concentric cylinder or collect cell where the fluid is puts. Between two cylinders. And the in a cylinder. Is normally being rotated. And the device measures the torque. To keep a certain formation. On the fluids. At this torque and then be. With some analysis related to the real logical properties of the fluid. In the gap. Apart from this concert or in geometry we also use parallel plate geometries and. Cone plate your arteries. At a parallel plate is usually used for very very viscous materials or materials with a high Atlas to city. Which are difficult to put into a. Concentric cylinder geometry. You would destroy the sample. If you try to do that for such material. So then we put them between two parallel plates. The layer thickness here is usually not more than a millimeter. And again. The lower plate is usually. Fixed and the upper plate is rotating. Or also letting. And we measure the torque. To maintain a certain day from Asian. In this job. Three now. A problem with parallel plates and the reason why we're not using it very often is that. It doesn't have a constant. Strain. Applied to the sample. You see that. Going from the middle of the geometry. To the outside. The strain is actually increasing. And this lowered the geometry had a conclave geometry. Is compensating for that fact the two pier of this cone. Is almost touching the lower plate. So you see that going from outside to inside. The gap is getting smaller and smaller. Now destroying all sheer right. And his system is always the velocity. Change here. Divided by this gap. And of course the velocity goes down. As you go inwards. But the gap also becomes smaller so to the coefficient. Already did. Dividing these two. Actually gives you then a constant shear rate. Solid materials we can test these with compression. Extension devices. An extension we put a sheet. Or a sample piece between two clams and then we stretch it. More often actually we do compression. Testing. Where we take a cylindrical sample of a material. Put it between two plates and then the upper plate. Is pushing down on the material. Now what we can do here is varies types of stresses various types of tests. One test is what we have a steady. Compression. We can also do step confessions and then look at the relaxation of the material. And so on and so there are many modes that we can actually use. To the form. Materials and. Check their response. So to summarize we've seen several techniques that we can use to characterize the real logical properties. Of food products. We can use and it will go to. To measure the viscosity all through Tony and fluids. Share properties of materials can be determined using. Stress controlled or row two of his commentors and solid materials can be tested using a text or allies or. So a compression. Extension device. Thank you for your attention.\n",

                "text": "I and this clip we are going to discuss the reality of this call lasting materials from previous. Clips we've discussed. To limiting cases viscous behavior and elastic solid behavior. Now the number of food products that actually behave in these two extremes. Is rather limited. Most food products have a behavior. Slightly in between these two areas. And therefore they are called. Fiscal. Elastic. Because they display. Both types of behavior. Depending on how fast. You have to forming them now. Fiscal a lot of behavior. Can have some very peculiar phenomena if we take a Newtonian fluid and we start storing it. We know that we create a wake here. And the surface. Is bending down towards the rod for a vehicle lastic material. Actually it moves up for it. And you can get something which is called. Role to climbing. So gradually your fiscal Essex fluid is climbing up the middle road. And if you stir the solution. Fast enough. It actually can empty your entire container. Some of the manifestations is that when you. Extrude a fluid. Or you let it flow from an annulus that a Newtonian fluid. The free flowing. Liquid here. Will contract. For a fiscal lasting material that would actually show. Swellings So the flew it will become. Wider. As it flows down. Another typical example here is the jugular siphon. So we all know that we can use a siphon to get fluid from a basin. And for Newtonian fluid when we move to siphon up. Of course we stop siphoning off flew it for a nano towing fluid is actually not true. But. Cause of the A list a city which is in the system. If we move to siphon up. We keep on pulling fluid up. And here you see a picture of this. You might think that if the fluid is falling down here actually. The fluid is being pulled up. In to decipher and. Against gravity and you can clearly see that it is not draining here. Because if it were draining. You would have to see this phenomenon here. Swelling. So at the tip it would be wider. And you see that it gets narrower. So the fluid is actually going up or it's here. As a result of its elasticities. And here is another typical example if you take a container of his classic material. And you start pouring it. You can take a pair of scissors. And you can cut. The flow. Now for a Newtonian fluid of course this wouldn't have any effect your sisters would just go through the fluid and it would keep on flowing. But for an elastic material. You would actually cut the flow in half the lower part. Would slowly fall down. And the upper part as a result of illicitly in the system will actually. Flow back into the container. And all these pictures actually come from a book by broad. Strong and has a car so these phenomena are very well known for a long time. Now. How do we characterize a physical lastic material. As I said it has characteristics. Between a viscous liquid which. We test by. Continuously shearing it. But it also has characteristics of a solid. Which we do fall into a certain extent. We use a different nation for his coalescing materials which is in between these two extremes. So we shared a sample to a certain extend. But then share back and forth. So we turn to differ mation. Into. And also lation. So here you see the curve for that information. It is given as a sine function. With a certain. Amplitude. Become a zero and a frequency Omega. And as a result of this to from a should we get a stress in the material. And this. In the linear regime. Will also be a sinusoidal function. So how will a material of his classic. Material. Responds to a strain of this form. Well let's look at the extremes. The viscous liquid and. The solid what they do. Under such a different nation. What we saw that. Four of his because liquid distress is equal to. It was cause of three times the shear rate which is the time derivative of the string. Now the time derivative of this function gamma zero sign of a Gotti. Is simple equal to Gamma zero. Oh my God. It's a cosigner Almighty and from trigonometry. We can rewrite this function. Co-signing on AGAZZI as a sine function. Sign on the T. plus one have pie. So we see that the response of a viscous liquid. Is again. A sine function. But shifted by. One half by. Now the other extreme to stall it. We saw that the stress there is given as. G. times the strain. So this is simply. When we substitute this. Function here. Gamma zero G.. Sign on the T.. So we see that for an elastic solid. We get a strong response. Similar to what we have apply to the two functions are. What we call. In phase with each other not a combination. Of the two responses for his call lasting material. We will again get assigned function. But now with a phase shift. And that phase shift is going to be somewhere between one have pie. And zero. We see that here again the limits of the face shift. The stress here is slightly shifted. With respect to the differ mation signal. By an angle Delta and Delta. Will be between these two extremes. If it is zero. Then the material responds purely elastic. If it is one have pied an immaterial response purely viscous. So. Actually by using this to from Asian mold we can separate the viscous. Elastic contributions. Of the response. And how do we do that well. We look at this. Response here. Sign on the T. plus Delta. And we use again trigonometry. To expand. This function. We know that. Sign on the T. plus Delta. Can be written as. Co-signed Delta. Sign on Gotti. Plus a term. Proportional to sign Delta. Co-signed on the Getty. So we write this. Term basically S. D. prime come a zero. Sign on the T.V. and this term. We change the coast I'm going to again into a sign. And what we see here is a superposition of. The elastic response and. The viscous response. So we've taken our stress single and decomposed it. In its two fundamental contributions. Now the model I hear. These are to find the prime is Sigma zero. Co-signed Delta. Over gamma zero. And this is called the elastic or. Storage modulus. Because for an elastic differ mation all the energy that you apply to the material is reversible is stored in the product. When you release to the form and force this energy is given off again. To the surroundings. The second modulus here G. double prime. That is equal to. Sigma zero sine Delta. Of a gamma zero. And this is the viscous or. Loss modulus. This is the amount of energy that you put into the system and through viscous friction. It is dissipated. It is turned into heat. So this cannot be regained. Now another property that we tend to define for fiscal lastic middle. Materials is the last tension and it is the ratio of. D. double prime. Over to prime. So if you use the previous expressions it's sine Delta. Of a cosign Delta. And that is equal of course to the tension of Delta. Now this last ten thousand is an important characteristic that we use to determine whether the system is behaving like a gel or. Like a liquid. If this last time didn't. It's less than one. It means that the prime. Is larger than G. double prime. And we say that the material behaves like a gel. If the last tensioned. Is larger than one. Then the double prime. Is higher than G. prime. And we say that the system behaves like a liquid. Now just as in the ideal. Liquids and ideal solids we have also an ideal form of. Linear. Has coalesced behavior. And that means that for two systems. G. prime and you double prime are constant. They are independent of the strain that you apply. And they are independent of the time or. Frequency that you apply. In general. We will see that G. prime. Is a function of the applied strain and of time. And the same holds for G. to double prime. And in most cases actually we replace the time dependence. By a frequency dependence. Now let's look at some known and toning behaviors. In and use cases. And this particular experiment. Is a step strain. So we haven't under formed. Material in the beginning of the experiment. And then we do form it by a fixed value Gumma zero. And we look at the stress. As a function of time. Resulting from that deformation. Now we see that we have a very strong. Rise in the stress. Which is the elastic response of the material. And then we see that gradually. Distress is decreasing. And this is the viscous behavior. Of the material. What happens in the material is that we have. Entanglements which we have basically put under strain on the system is then slowly disentangle ing. By viscous flow. And Biggest get you. Relaxation. Some other. Manifestations of fiscal lasting behavior. Is that the stress that you measure during an experiment. Becomes the pendent on how fast you are deforming it. And you see here to curse one measure it. At slow speed. And one measured at high speed. And you see that at high speed the stress is higher than at low speed. The reason for that is. If you. The form of material very rapidly. There is very little time for the structure to relax and. All the energy that you put into the material. Is stored reversible ie as elastic energy. So then you get a higher. Stress in the material. Than when you perform a very slowly. When you give the material enough time to relax. And the stress will increase. Less fast. I guess it does in the high speed experiment. Now what we typically do in the US. Also authority from ations off. Structures is that we apply. A strain sweep. So we start a very small differ Masons. And then we step wise increase the strain. And what we always see and these systems is. You first have a regime here. Where the modulus is nearly constant. And then the structure starts to break down and yield. And we get strengthening. And some structures we can also find. Strain hardening. And this means that before. The structure. Starts to yield here. We see an increase in modulus. And that is again. Related to the top of structure that you have. If you are stretching. Chains between entanglements. It can give you a higher resistance. Before the entire game and start to rupture. And then. The strain decreases the modulus. Of the material. OK To summarize. We've seen that most food materials actually. Display a vis call lasting behavior which is an intermediate between pure elastic and pure viscous. Behavior. Autons of these. Depends on the rate of differ mation. If you do form a material very rapidly. It will behave more like a solid. If you behavior. Slowly. If you would perform it slowly. It will behave as if it because fluid. Thank you for your attention.\n",

                "text": "And this clip we're going to discuss the reality of solids. Out there is a fundamental difference between fluids and solids. When we apply a stress to of fluids fluids cannot sustain stresses so they will start flowing. And keep on flowing. As long as we maintain the stress for a solid material. This is not the case. When we apply a stress she is tries to this. Upper part of this material. It will be displaced over a certain distance. You X.. And there. It will stop. Now in such a system how do we characterize the differ mation. We do it in a similar way. As for fluids. But now we don't have a gradient in dish. In a velocity. We have a gradient now. In the displacement. X. minus X. zero. This is maximum. At the top level. As it is zero here. At the bottom level. So rather than a sheer rate we have a strain. Gamma X. Y.. Without adult. Which is the gradient of. You X.. With respect to Y.. All written. In terms of X. coordinates. It is the differential of X. minus X. zero. With respect to Y.. And since we are dividing. Length by lengthy here. It has no unit. So it's just a number. So this is how we characterize. Strain in shear we are now going to look at some. Characterizations. In other. Geometries. First before we do that. We rarely actually look at the differential form of the strain. But we do is at least four. Very small differ Masons we approximate. The Strain by us. Divided by. Delta why. And that gives a stand. If we use trigonometry. A number. Tongue. Tangent. Feta. So what's the tangent of this angle here. And for a small to from ations. We can approximate this by theta itself. This is how we typically calculate a string. In a real experiment. Now. And extensional day from Asians we first look at uni actual differ Masons again. Where there is no change in the vertical directions. This block here is extended. In two directions here. By a distance Delta L.. And again we see. There's a change in differ mation here. The middle part of the block. Stays at the same position and. The far side of the block. Moves. The farthest from its original position. So there is a gradient. In displacement. In this extra rection. And this is characterized by the X. axis train. Which is the differential of you X.. With respect to X.. Now important to note is that in such a different nation. Where the vertical. Dimensions of the block are not changing. The volume is of course not conserved. And this is quite unusual for footballers. We'll see an example of a different nation where this. Where it is conserved. In a few slides. Now again. We really used to differential form of the strain. For small strains. But we basically do is we take the displacement. Delta X.. And we divided by the original length. Off. This block of material. So we approximate gamma X. X.. By Delta L.. Over L's hero. Now the case where we stretched a material and. In the perpendicular directions it gets thinner. This is called. By actual strain. It is basically treated in the same way. For the different nation in the X. direction it is still the differential of us. With respect to X.. But now we have to account for the fact that the results are a different nation in disease E M Y Y corrections. Which are given by just differential. That will not go into much detail. In the relation between these two. But in such a different nation to volume is conserved. And of course the degree of. Differ mation And is that. Why direction. Will depend on how much you have to form the material in the X. direction. And a relation between these two from a sense is given by the process or ratio. Now what does the relation between. Stress and strain look for solace. Now in the ideal case of linear behavior. We get something that looks very similar to what we saw for fluids. Only we do not have. Share rates here we now have to strain here. And in a sheer. We see that. The sheer stress. Is equal to G. times. The strain. Where Jesus called the elastic modulus and. An extension we see that. Sigma X X is eight times. The X X strain and E. is the extensional modulus now. The equivalence. Of the Newtonian fluid is the Hokie an elastic solid Hokie and comes from books law Phillis this is the that is the ideal behavior of an elastic spring and. When the material is a Hokie an elastic solid it means. That is Constans. He is constant and we again we have that he is three times. G.. Now. Most materials can have this behavior. Only a very very small. Different nations. For instance gelatin differ Masons less than one percent will half. Hokie an elastic solid behavior. Certain globular proteins. A very small there from Asians will also have to its type of behavior. In general will have no Newtonian view or non Hokie in behavior. So understanding behaviors that we saw influence are also observable and solids. They have a slightly different name here. If we look at the stress. Versus. The strain. And of course for the hokey and elastic material we see a straight line because it was a linear relation. And many materials we see that this curve is leveling off. And we call that a strain. Softening. So the material. Becomes weaker as we are forming it. And of course in the plot of a G. forces the string. We see than a decreasing curve. Not a vast majority of. Solids in food. Has this type of behavior. We also have the reverse. Where asked would have formed a material. It becomes stronger. And this is called. Strain hardening. We see it here in the plot of G. forces the strain. We see that as the strain is increasing. G. is increasing as well. And this is basically happening in. Covertly cross-link. Protein gels or in gelatin gels. What it basically. The reason for this behavior is that when you have permanent cross lings in a network. It will basically. Take more more force. To stretch. These segments. Between two crossings drawn here schematically. This is a sketch of a network. And as long as I have a fairly extensive chain between two. Crossings. I can fairly easily stretch it. But as I stretched his to maximum extension. I get a very very strong resistance against further. Differ mation of the material. I would have to have to break. The covalent cross link to deformity. Even further So this is the reason why we have a very strong increase in the modulus. Now. To summarize. We seen that we can characterize the reality of salts in a similar way. And how we characterize fluids. We have stress. Relations. To the strain of the material. We've looked at Ideal Hokkien behavior. But its relation is linear. And we've looked at two forms of nonlinear behavior. Strange softening. And strange hardening. Thank you for your attention.\n",

                "text": "I and this clip we are going to discuss the reality of not Newtonian. Fluids. We saw in a previous clip. But for Newtonian physics like which we have a very simple relation between the stress. In the material and. The flow rate. In a sheer flow. We see that the shear stress. Is equal to the She has cost eight times the shear rate and an extension of flow we see that. The extensional stress. Is equal to the extension of the skull city. Times. Extensional flow rate. Now a property of Newtonian fluids is not the extension of his costy is equal to three times. She has got city. And both of them are constant. Independent of time. And independent. Off the flow rate. Now very few. Food products actually have to stop of behavior. Only. Water has its glycerol. Maple syrup. But most products have a complicated. Microstructure. And they have a non-linear relation between. Stress and shear rate. And some typical behavior S. that we see. In most food products is that this relation between. Extensional. And she writes is costing. No longer holds. And the reason for that is quite simple. We saw that shear can be decomposed. In an extensional flow. And a rotation and. In a simple fluid. There is barely no resistance against rotation. So their shear can be simply expressed in terms of. Extension of his coffee. But for a complex product. Like a dispersion. We usually see that the particles are weakly aggregated and form. Very big clusters. Now the shear will then start to rotate such a cluster. And there is a finite resistance against that. So the rotation of this cause of the in a complex fluid is not zero. And that means then that the relation between. Extensional and she has cost you no longer holds. The same thing happens in problem Eric fluids are there to share flow will stretch your polymer chain and. Oriented in the direction of flow. They will orient. Parallel to each other and have less friction. And when the shear flow starts to rotate such a long chain. Of course it has a resistance to that. And again the relation between. Long geisha nal and shear viscosity doesn't hold anymore. Now there is a far more important behavior. And this is that the first cause of these that we just discussed. Also start to depend on. Sheer rate. And on time. And a very simple example of that relation is given in this simple experiment. What you can do is you can fill two cylinders. With a fluid. Which in rest have the same viscosity. If you know remove this plate. Then both of the fluids. Will start to flow out of the tube. And then the left we have a Newtonian fluid. Which has a certain flow rate. We see that the. Polymer solution on the right. Will actually start to flow faster. Although. In the beginning. They have the same score city. What happens in the known Newtonian fluid here. Is that it is sheer thinning. As it starts to flow. If this causes the decreases. And hence the fluid. Accelerates. And it will drain. Faster than the Newtonian fluid. So this is a typical example of Newtonian. Behavior. And we call that behavior. She is thinning. It is not the only type of Newtonian behavior that we see in food products. We also see. Phenomena like she has thickening we see. Being him. And plastic flow behavior and. We see pics of tropic behavior. And all of these four times is not in tone and behavior. Will now start to discuss. In more detail. Now here is an example of she offending behavior. And we see S B plot. It was called City. As a function of the sheer rate. That. It drops significantly. At low share as we have a high viscosity which gets lower and lower. As we increase this year rate. Now in comparison to Newtonian fluid. Would simply give you our horizontal line here because of his costy is independent of the shear rate. We can also look at the plot. Of stress. First as. She her right and of course for a Newtonian fluid that is a straight line. Because the relation between. The stress and a shear rate. Is linear. For she has been in fluid. We see that the curve. Is leveling off significantly. Because as you increase the shear rate the viscosity. Is lower and lower. Now. How can we understand. This behavior. Well many food products. Actually show. Thinning behavior. But they do so for different reasons we really have to look into the microstructure of a product to understand why they are shifting. And we do this first for micro molecular solutions so. Cornstarch or exam thoughts allusions which we often use for. Thickening sources. Why Today's have. Sinning behavior. Well if you look at the system. In rest you see that these polymer chains of sufficiently high concentrations. Entangled. So do I look like a. Now. Like a bowl of spaghetti where older strands are and tangled with each other when you start sharing such a solution. What happens is that these. Things are this in time gold. And they are. Oriented. In the direction of the flow and. Of course you can imagine that the resistance against flow in such a configuration is much lower than the resistance. In the highly untangles state. So this is basically responsible for the decrease in viscosity. As a function of sheer rate. Asked we increase this year rate. We more and more disentangle and orient. The chains. In the direction of flow. And we can study this in a little bit more detail. In this life. Because what happens when we start sharing such a solution of polymer chains. Is of course we disentangle them. But on their path through the fluid. They do bump into new chains. And what happens in such a situation. Is actually two fold. It could. It's two chains here could form a new. Entanglement order because just simply pass each other and what happens basically the pens on the sheer rate. Because the shear rate. As we saw has units. One over a second so one divided by the shear rate. Is a characteristic time for the flow. And we call that. Delta T. gamma. And that time decides. How long these chains. Are in close proximity to each other there is another relevant. Time scale here and that is delta T. that's called the entanglement time. That's the time the two chains. Need to form a new entanglement this happens by. Diffusion of chain segments. Now but we get in this situation is. When the time. The sheer time is much larger than the entanglement time. It means that the two polymer chains. Have enough time to form a new entanglement. And these two chains. That were previously. Untangles. Will now be untangled again. Now in the situation where the sheer time is much shorter than the entanglement time. Just simply isn't enough time to form an entanglement. And that means that the number of entanglements is going to decrease. Compared to the initial state where you had a lot of entanglements. When the system was not she or. Now if you plot. The viscosity then as a function of sheer rate. We typically get forty systems a plot like this where in this region here. We have a constant. Viscosity. And this is called a zero she has called City. And in this region here the rate of disentanglement. Is roughly equal to the rate at which new entanglements are formed. So the number of entanglements is constant and hence the viscosity is constant. Then you come in through a regime. Where the sheer time. Is much shorter than the entanglement time. And that means that the rate of. Disentanglement. Is larger than the rate of. Entanglement formation and hence because causality. Is going down. Now. We just had the explanation why. Polymer solutions. Are shifting dispersions are typically also shifted in but for completely different reasons. There are no polymer chains there which are untangled. What you see in those systems is that the particles. Typically are weekly associated into large clusters. And you can imagine that when you start sharing such a system. There's a lot of resistance to these large clusters have to move. Have to move past each other and this gives you a very high viscosity. Now as you start increasing the shear rate. You start breaking down these clusters they get smaller and smaller until you have individual particles which start to align themselves in layers. Now it is quite easy to understand that structure of. This will have far less resistance to share. Than a structure like this. And this is why. Dispersions are extremely serious here thinning and it's cause a tee off. Tomato Ketchup an apple sauce. Can go down by three to four orders of magnitude. As you increase the shear rate. Now there is also a behavior called shear thickening. And as the name suggest it is the opposite of sheer finning what happens in this case is that this coastie. Increases. Ass. You increase the shear rate. And in the plot off. She has stress for us as the sheer weight you see that. With respect to do. Newtonian fluid. The stress actually increases. More than linear. Now this is fairly rare behavior and it is only occurring in concentrated suspensions and. We have to go back to the previous slide to understand is this layer of structure that we see here at very high shear rates can become unstable. That means that particles here. Are going to fluctuate. Out of their layer. Bump into. Other Particles in the next layer. And then. Form clusters again. So you don't get a very sudden very strong increase in. Viscosity. So this is the explanation for Shiva thickening behavior. Now we know from experience that there are fluids which. If you apply a very small force on them that actually don't flow at all. It's a real example of such a fluid as catch up if you take a fresh. Ketchup bottle. And you open it. You can just turn the. Ketchup bottle upside down. And the catch it will not flow out of it. Now why is that. Well. Catch it actually consists of a concentrated suspension of particles. And these are associated into a weak. Gel structure. At rest. So that means. We're basically not looking at a fluid but at a solid. Now if you start shaking the bottle. You destroy this structure and the system becomes a liquid and it can start to flow. And this is basically illustrated in this. In these two curves here. You have a certain minimum stress. Applied to this type of system. Before it starts to flow. And this stress here is called the yield stress and. What happens. Subsequently determines what type of fluid we are dealing with. If you have a linear behavior. After the system has yielded. We call it a big immaterial. And when we see shift thinning behavior. After yielding. Then we call this plastic flow. Now in both cases if you plot the viscosity. As a function of shear rate. You will see that you have a decreasing. Viscosity. Now here are some examples of the behavior that we just discussed we saw shifting. Actually I'm just mentioning milk custard and yogurt here. But the vast majority of food products is actually she's sitting. So there are many more examples that you could put there. She is thinking one of the very few. Materials that can show this behavior is peanut butter. That's a very dense suspension of peanut particles which can show this behavior. And being in plastic flow. Behavior. Well you can see that in dough. In margarine. Intimated ketchup. Whipped cream. But also products like apple sauce. Now. So far we've looked at behaviors which are a function of the applied. Flow rate. But we can also have. Behavior which depends on time and. Here are two examples of the hot. Ticks of tropic behavior. And history says. And both of these. Touch behavior are related that. The structural changes that we had just discussed. Which are the cause for the sheer thinning behavior. These usually take time to occur. If you are decreasing. Cluster sizes in the suspension. It takes time to do so. So if you measured a relation. Off. She has stress as a function of shear rate. And basically you measure. Say for ten seconds at each year rate. For thirty seconds. Or for one hundred twenty seconds. And you can see different curves. Because in this case in the curve for one hundred twenty seconds. The time. There is more time for structural breakdown in the system. And a very interesting phenomenon occurs when you do a string. She knew where you first. Increase this year rate. And then you go back to lower. She writes again. Well in such an experiment. The structure of which you have destroyed by increasing sheer rate. Is slowly recovering. But if you do not give the system enough time to recover. You will actually in the back loop. You will measure a lower first call city. Than in the forward. And this is called. History says. So to summarize what we've seen so far. We've discussed various types of knowledge on behavior. We've discussed. She has thinning. And seeing that it is related to the breakdown of clusters. Or the disentanglement of polymer chains. If you looked at sheer thickening behavior. Which is primarily occurring in. Concentrated suspensions. We've discussed. Bingham flow behavior and plastic flow behavior. And we discussed. The reasons for Texas proper behavior. Thank you for your attention.\n",

                "text": "Today we are going to discuss food for elegy. And in particular we're going to look at. Newtonian flu it's a first question that I want to address today is what is reality. Why is an important in food. And then we end this clip with a discussion. Off viscous liquids. So the first question what is reality. Well. Quite simply put. It is the signs that studies. The link between forces applied on the fluid. Or a solid material and. The rates. Or extend it started to form. So we can see some examples here when we are storing in a source. We use a certain force. To do that and the material will give us a certain resistance against AAT. And it will start to flow at a certain rate. Another example. We see here we buy Donovan Apple. So we get a certain force. On the material. And at some point. It starts to break off. And fractures. All of these are examples of why. Reality is important in food. It is important in the production of food. And in the consumption. Particular in this aspect. You may not realize this but a lot of the sensory perception that you have when you consume a product is coming from it's reality from its texture. So the relation between the forces that we apply on the system and the differ mation. Is usually very complex and food. Because of the complex structure of these products. And what we will do is we will discuss for us some limiting cases. And the first case that we will discuss is the. Purely fiscus liquids. Into ideal flow. Configurations. We'll discuss it in sheer flow and. In extensional flow. Now. Before we can come up with a relation between stress and differ mation rate. We first have to define our due from Asian rates and we do that for us for sure flow. And this is an example of. She'll flow. She'll flow is something that we encounter of for instance in pipe flows. And the general characteristics of show flow is that the velocity here and. Chosen in the X. direction. Is varying. In the Y. direction. So the. Philosophy has a maximum here in the middle of the pipe and is zero. At the wall of the pipe. So she flows are really related to. Frictional flows you have elements of fluid. Very close to each other which have differences in philosophy. And they exert. Friction forces on each other now. We know that this friction force is going to be stronger as the difference in velocity is higher. So the natural. Measure for the differ mation in these systems. Is the sheer rate. It's the. Philosophy gradient in the Y. direction. So we define the different nations right in the system as Got my daughter. X. Y. and the components here X. Y.. In the subscript. They don't know that we're looking at the philosophy gradient of the. X. velocity. In the Y. direction. Now the units. Of this from Asian right. Over second. We can do a similar thing for extension of flow. And extensional flow. You see some examples here. Occur in extruder as all are. On the right here in a piping back. Which is perhaps the simplest example of such a flow. What you see in this. Type of flow as to what the fluid is being squeezed in a narrower and narrower tube. And therefore it accelerates. In the X. direction. So here it is given schematically. At some point in a fluid. We have a homogeneous philosophy. In the Y. direction. But it varies. In the X. direction as the fluid moves forward. It is accelerating by a Knology with the shear rate. We have here a measure for the differ mation rate which is not the velocity gradient and. Why direction but it is the velocity Gratton in the X. direction. So here we say. Did the from Asian rate or extensional rate is given by. Gamma dot. X. X.. And it is equal to the derivative of the velocity in the X. direction. With respect to X.. So we now have are two main differ Mason raised the shear rate. And the extensional rate. To find these two times of differentiation. Are not completely independent of each other and we can see that in this. Schematic here. Say we take a fluid. Element here. And we apply a shear the formation to it. So we have a velocity in this direction on this and. And a velocity in the opposite direction. At the other and now this. Shear flow is shared to from ation. We can decompose it into a components that goes in the same direction as the fluid element. And one which is perpendicular to the fluid element and. The top one here. Basically this arrow. And this arrow. Gives you an extension of the fluid element. And the other one. The perpendicular component. Gives you a rotation of the fluid element. So we see that the shear. We have imposed on this fluid element. Can be decomposed into an extensional rate. And the rotational rates. So they are clearly. Connected to each other now. We move to the relation between Shearman extensional. Rates and. The stress. In the material. And there we have really a large. Choice of possibilities. These relations. Are typically very very complex and food products. But we have some limiting cases and. The first limiting cases where we simply assume a linear. Relation between stress. So to stress. She has stress. Sigma X. Y.. Is a constant a time. Times. The shear rate and is a tide is constant. Is the sheer viscosity. Then we have the same thing in extension a flow. We assume that the extensional stress. Is a constant times. Doing Stansell flow rate and. The extensional Frisco City. Now. I mentioned to Newtonian fluids in the beginning of this clip and. What already is. Well. Newtonian fluids are the most simple form of a fluid. And they are characterized by. The condition that the extensional. The skull city. Is three times. She has called City. And both of them are constant and independent of the different nations rate and independent of time. So this is a very ideal. Type of fluid and. It is limited in the classes of mature. Is that behavior like this. For instance water is one of these. Glycerol and. Maple syrup. For the rest. Most fluids actually have no Newtonian behavior. And will discuss what is known and Tony behavior is in the next clip. So to summarize. We've seen in this clip what's real a G. ism Why does important in food products and. Then we continued with Newtonian fluids and saw that these have a linear relation between. Stress and differ mation right. And of this causes these that are associated with these two slows the sheer physical city and. Extension of its costy. A constant independent. Of time. And independent of flow rate.

                "text": "Hi My name is laid out sockets and I will be presenting a clip on food physics today. I first want to discuss with you know what food physics actually is. Food physics is a branch of soft matter physics. Applied to food products. And just as it other branches of self metaphysics we study structure function relations. So we're trying to link. Ingredients. The properties and structures of ingredients. To microscopic properties. Of products like a list of steel viscosity. Now this in itself is a fairly complicated process. Because you have to link. Properties on scales of say if you are not a meters. Two properties. Which are effective on several. Millimeter scales. So the way we do that. Typically. Is by using a multi scale approach. So we first study how as a result of interaction forces between the ingredients. The interactions cause. Ingredients to organize. On colloidal scales of a few microns. And then we study. How these colloidal structures affect. Microscopic properties and I will give you a number of examples of how. Microstructure can affect the viscosity. To tell strength. And the stability of products. The first one we're going to look at is milk. Well you know from experience that milk. Is a fiscus fluid with a target appearance. Now why is that not to understand that we have to look more into the microstructure of milk. And if we do that we see it's a very heterogeneous. Structure. You see large objects here of a few microns. Which are fed globe ules. We see some dock spots here. Which are partially in the liquid and partially at the interface here. These are casing my cells and. There are various other molecules that we cannot actually see in. A continuous face. Now if we zoom in. Further on these dark spots here the casing my cells. We see that these are. Aggregates. Composed of many individual casing molecules. They have a size of roughly two hundred to three hundred nominee Toure's. The components. Left in the fluid phase and partially also in this interface here are way proteins. And these are even smaller than the case in my cells they have a diameter of about five. Down the meters. They stabilize to help to stabilize this interface here. But bottom so they can also be structuring agents and they are left over when you make cheese. Out of milk and. This way protein can be used as a jelling agent. For instance just by minute. But if you lazing. The interactions between the molecules. Now I just mentioned cheese we know from experience that we can turn this. Viscous liquid into a solid material called cheese. And how does that actually work. Now in cheese making we add an enzyme. To the milk. And what does enzyme does it cuts off. The outer layer of casing molecules. From the mysel making them myself unstable. The my cells then start to aggregate. Into clusters of these clusters grow into a space spanning network. And that network has a lot of properties. It is what we refer to as cheese. So this is not our example of how interactions between components. In a product. Affect its properties. The next one we are going to look at is a very familiar product. Gelatin jails. And we know that when we make a gelatin dessert we take gelatin. We dissolve it at high temperatures in a liquid and subsequently cool down that liquids. At a certain point. The liquid turns that into a solid material. We know also that. We reheat the sample that. That's the same temperature. It starts to melt again. And to us from an elastic solid. Into a liquid. How does that work. Now to understand that we have to look again at the micro structure and we see. When we zoom into the structure of the Stilton gels. Is that they are not homogeneous systems again. The gelatin molecules are not homogeneously dispersed in the liquid phase. They are aggregated into strands. And these transform a space bonding network. And this network. Gets jealous and it's a list to city. If we look at individual. Strands here. Into their structure we see that they are built out of three. Chain segments which are intertwined. Into a helix. Structure. And this helix structure is stabilized by. Hundred balls. Now we learn later in this class that to use hydrogen bombs. Are temperature sensitive. And as you increase the temperature they become weaker. Now this is the reason that when you take a gelatin gel and you start heating it. At some point. These bonds will become so weak that these helix structures fall apart. And the system goes from a state where it is aggregated into a network. To a viscous solution. Of individual. Protein molecules. So this explains the melting behavior. Of gelatin gels. Purely in terms of the interactions between the ingredients. A last example that I want to discuss with you is. Beer fall. We know that beer foam. Has a stability of several minutes and. We can ask ourselves why is this foam stable. Well to understand that. We have to zoom in to the structure again and see that it is a dispersion of air bubbles in a liquid. And here we see the individual. Air bubbles. And they are surrounded by thin. Liquid films. Now how. Adi's. Film stabilized. Find a stand that. We have to look at again. On a deeper level into the structure of the individual. Interfaces between liquid and air. And we see that these interfaces are very heterogeneous. You see dark spots on lights posters images. Recorded using boost and a microscopy. And these. Dog and bright areas have different. Structural properties. We look at the bright areas first. And we see that they consist of a protein. Network which gives these patches. Something less to city. If we zoom in even further. We see that these strands a built out of a globe of the protein called L. to be one protein. Now the dark areas here. These are. Stabilized by small molecules. Surfactants called I so alpha acids. And these have a very mobile structure. So together. This combined structure gives you a physical elastic behavior. And this is responsible for stability of the film. So this theme. The relation between. Interactions between ingredients. The resulting colloidal. Structures and. The resulting microscopic. Properties of a product that is a central theme. Off the class of food physics and. In teaching this. We will discuss the following topics. We will start with. Both reality. Where we define what viscosity analyst. Lisicki actually is. We also discuss how they are related to the structures in food. Then the next topic. We will discuss the interactions responsible for the formation of these structures. The next topic. Is protein structures where we apply the knowledge that we've learned about interaction. It's too. Protein. I could geisha and then we will discuss why. Molecules like corn starch. Or exam time on are such a good cause of fires. That again has to do with their. Microstructure and interactions between. Chains and solvent. We have a substantial topic on. Interfaces. Their properties and theirs to belittle. And we conclude the lectures. Was a topic. On dairy products. So to summarize. We've seen that food physics. Is a branch of soft matter physics specializing in food products. It studies structure functions relationships. From the molecular. To the microscopic scale. Using to a loyal scale. As an intermediate. Thank you for your attention.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome. In this clip I want to tell you about the linkages between into cropping and plant disease. And the key message here is that. If you defensive fire your cropping system. If you grow into crops which make sure it's a prop species. You will suppress. Diseases. Now this picture. It shows a lot of. Into crop fields. Along the Yellow River and gums to China. Point you to some fields here. You see all of these crop fields. Strives. Why it is tribes. It is because there are different crop species. Growing in narrow strips odos might be strips of. One two three four corporals and as the other species then again is the first as the second. And so on. So you see that there are all those strip systems also in some fields you see trees so farmers are also diversifying into growing. In this case. Fruit trees. This is the same thing from a little closer by. This is soybeans. This is wheat. And as you can see it's. Well probably four rows of weed and. Two rows of soybean. Here's another. And even more complex system. It's actually it's a very small field as you see. It has wheat. It has the soybeans. But the farmers have also chosen to grow into soybeans and. The farmers grow. Apple trees. Why do farmers do that. Well. The key reason that farmers do that in the pockets the way to do it in China is to get more yield. Because different species have somewhat different requirements for light. Water. Nutrients in different times of the season. And because they are complimentary. And what they need. They can grow more if they grow within a. Or of a different species than if they grow with a neighbor that has the exactly the same needs as. They have. One more picture here. Flax. It's grown here for the oil from the seeds. Soybeans and maize. And there's actually there is an incredible diversity of systems so my own experience is especially in China. And in China I've seen many different in the crop system so this shows you wheat and maize. This is. Wheat. With soybeans. Here is potato with maize a very popular system in your non province in the south and. You can go on. There are many combinations which farmers try and farmers are experimenters. They look at the economics of the systems. They look at how well they produce and if it works still do it if it doesn't work they'll try something else. So very diverse. Now. Into cropping is widespread in smallholder farming in Asia Africa and South America but. We don't see it very much in Europe we don't see it very much in North America. Although we have some under someone with clover. Cereals and people are trying to make cereals with. Peas or. To have. Production for. Feed. But. Is really not all that much. Is however quite important for agricultural production in China. But we think it is in decline because of the rising cost of labor. So people will tend to go to the city. To earn more money but if they are in the city they cannot manage these labor intensive systems. So there is a problem there are these to be solved in a future it is how to do this first city in agriculture. And do it in a way that doesn't cost. Quite as much labor. The key reason as I already said is to get more yield per unit land area. What you also got is. There's a whole suite of. Ecosystem services that is improved. You get better pest control you get usually better Disease Control. There's a contribution to soul quality that can be a contribution to. Erosion control so there's a lot of benefit to this diversification. So this provides. Inspiration for making the Western agriculture. More productive and sustainable. So we don't want to go to all those small fields and. All the labor. But we like to have the benefits. Performance off. Into cropping. And I'll point out on this slide here. The economic performance is. Quantified by looking at the land equivalence. Ratio. Lenticular Lynch ratio has a very simple calculation it's the yield of the first crop specious. If I did by the monoculture yield. And it's the yield of the second crop species. Also divided by it's more the culture yield so it's simply. The sum of two. Relative you. If you look at what. This lens equivalence ratio becomes It's usually. One point two ish It could also be one point three and. The interpretation of that if you analyze that formula. And I'm not going to do that here in the lecture but I will be in the notes. If you analyze it. Than it is the land area that would be needed as so crops. To produce the same yield. As a unit area. Of into crop. So if that is one point two it means. If you want to get into crop yield. Of one hectare of into crop. You would need one point to hack there are also crops. Here is illustration of that concept. This is the year of a hectare of wheat. Under certain conditions in China. Six thousand kilograms per hectare. This is the cotton yield. That is measured in length so it's the fiber of the cotton. It's. Twenty five kilograms per hectare. If you have to hector of. Into a crop. You get sixty to seventy percent of your weight. You also get sixty to eighty percent of your link you. So if you are interested in growing both. Wheat and cotton. This is a system that gives you more per unit lab. Oftentimes in into cropping you'll see temporal complementarity that means. Growing at different times. Of the season. And here it's not so different this is wheat. With soybeans. Although there are some time that the crops are growing alone. So that's an advantage. Your spring wheat with mace but here is the wheat. Cotton system. And it has a very strong. Temporal complementarity. In some cases there's. Facilitation and this picture is very interesting. It shows three major rows. And then. On the one side is wheat. On the other side. Is fava beans. And if you look at a picture of closely you'll see that the wheat. Close to the wheat rolls. Is not all that happy. It is suffering from severe competition. Is we just very competitive because it's so on earlier than the maize and the roots. There are definitely here. In a place where the maize is growing so it's taking the water is taking the nutrients and maize as a difficulty here. On the other side the maize is interacting with the fava beans. And this can be in at Fountain because Fabien is releasing organic assets in the soil that make phosphorus more available. And this can be and it found it to the to the maize and people that. Studied the root systems they have shown that the architecture of the root system. Is changed by into cropping. So major roots will stay away from wheat where they can. But it will look for roots. Want to tell you something about. Famous study. Done by a to with all published in Nature and it's. Genetic the first city and Disease Control and rice farmers. Planting rice and it's a commentary on the paper by two. And it says crops ranks. Through the first city. And this is what we really want. If we can make. Crops more robust to pests and diseases by the first if we should use that wherever we can now. A new nonprofit insight on China. This is a system that people have been using. On the slide you see. Rows here. Of. What is called glutinous rise. It is a traditional rice or a very tall plums. The Palms very easily lodged so fall over. And it cannot take very much nitrogen. The darker green rice here. Is a modern type of for righty. It is. Lodging resistant. It's also more disease resistant and. It can take a lot of nitrogen without. Lodging because it is. It has Georgia stems. Now. Combining these two types of a riot. In one field isn't at fault it because. The. Harbors rise is a recent glutinous rice is very susceptible to disease and. I'm talking about rice Bloss disease which is one of the key diseases in rice. Now if you have the hundred right in there you're diminishing the number of spores that's. Around. In the field. And this is an advantage to do glutinous rise Secondly the glutinous rice because it's sticking out of the canopy it will blow dry. More quickly. This will also reduce civility of disease. And certainly. Because there's a stiff. Highbridge rise. Here and. The glue to. His rise cannot fall over if you give it fertilizer so it can now take fertilizer and. It's resulting in very big advantages and become on the next slide. Not on the slide but on this one. It shows a new glutinous arise. Ninety four percent less Bloss disease. Eighty nine percent. Greater yield for a hill. Into crop. Than in a more crop. And hybrids rise actually. Also slightly less disease. Into crop than in the SO crop. And no you know the facts so only. Advantages. Is this general. Because the study by two is very famous by what about out of systems well. We've done analysis. Combining data from many different studies. And then. If you look at the amount of disease. Into crop. Compared to the SO cropping I think the ratio of. The incidence of the disease or. A measure for disease which is called disease index. That on average. It's less. Into crop. Than in so crop. Now the research the sort of variability is indicated by it is what shape. It's very close to a normal distribution actually and. This kind of shape is built by for every study. Calculate the ratio of disease in into crop to so crop and taking the local rate them and if the right atmosphere of the ratio is one and then there is no difference and. This line is indicated by defer to call here. And you see that in. Eighty percent of cases. The amount of disease. Into cropping. Is less than the so-called But there are also some cases where it's more. But on average it's less. And the same for the disease. Index. Is there any difference in different kinds of the. This was a different mode of spreading the spores. Different equality. Well not so much. The effect of into cropping is very general for airborne diseases and for sort of on diseases bowls. There is a very clear reduction in. Disease incidence. And disease index and. Same for bacteria diseases fungal diseases. Virus diseases. All these categories. Show these facts. So it's a very general phenomenon. So into cropping suppresses diseases. It does so very consistently efforts to fax a robust. Thirty to forty percent less disease. But there is quite some variability. The results of suit. Represent a best case that was a ninety five percent disease. Disease reduction. We need more in-depth analysis to explain this variability and. Yeah. We should think about how can we exploit this phenomenon. In modern agriculture a bit because we're not using that very much and I think there's a very interesting questions for breeders to think about how can we use this diversity in the crop field. Summarising. Into cropping. Produces more your per unit area. It can help suppress best diseases. Can also help suppress weeds. And it can help me to modern needs for productive and sustainable agriculture. In developed countries. But we need to upscaling. A mechanization. To two to apply this on the western conditions and. We also need to. Upscaling and. Modernization and mechanization. To keep it functioning and. Developing countries. Into cropping poses. Many challenging. Ecological questions on the mechanisms for over yielding. Improved resource capture and retention. Disease and Pest Management. So it's a very interesting model for us to study. Thank you very much for your attention.",

It shows a valley with rice fields. It also shows. Natural habitat. Now what you should be expecting is that is that in such a situation there will be links between. What happens in the crops. And what happens in the environment. What are those links. Here you know it's a crop field. And here is a plant seed blowing in. Wheat seed. In this case. Here is a lady beetle that can come in through the fields. And then if later beetles are produce into a field they will go to destroy any habitat. If it's can come in and can go out. Frogs and. Fungal spores. So it has a lot of. Linkage. Now I want to be talking especially about. Natural enemies and their farmer's friends and to provide natural pest control here are supposed to tow it. There is a lady beetle. Eating a fist to Paris a toe it will lay an egg. And then after some time. There will not be a monster about a fly coming out of the caterpillar but it will be a new person thought it was. Here's an adult lady beetle. And this is what the larvae.

They're also important predators or if it's how they are flies. The adults hover fly. It can contribute to poll a nation. But the. Larva of a fly. And it's really it's a fly magnet here on a wheat ear. It will eat. If it's. And it will eat quite a number of if it's. As a ballpark estimate. Natural enemies they can eat. Several tons of aces it's a day but it can go up to one hundred four. Large lady beetles adults or. Larvae. And also for the large surface. Slice. The larvae. Here's the part where Satori once began and maybe you're familiar with this image. It's a mommy. Off a fit. It is a different form of the EVA which which emerges. Which comes into being if it is parasitized. Now the economic value of biological pest control. As related to landscape. It is very large but estimates vary. There's a paper by low-Z. involved in that estimates the value of four and a half billion U.S. dollars per year. In the USA alone. This is very famous paper by. And call source. Which is on the worldwide value of. Ecosystem services. And it estimates the value of biological control at four hundred billion a year. Very large. There is a study in a more limited area but based on very good empirical data by. Landis at all and. It estimates the value of. Soybean aphid biological control. At two hundred forty million US dollars a year. And this value is due to two components one component is the. Reduced damage because if it's ARE controlled the populations are smaller. But also because there are savings on pesticides which is important. There is a cost of pesticides and of course there's an Vajra mental cost of pesticides. So it's good to to not have that. That's another aspect. Here it is that. Soon as you start to use pesticides. You may have to use them. Again because you also kill your natural enemies. So. Pesticides can cause what is called in the literature. A pesticide treadmill. I have to admit it's very difficult to stay away from using pesticides and have it all biological. It's quite a challenge. Now what can the landscape do. Well. Anime's natural enemies. They need to crop habitats. In the landscape. Why do they needed. They needed for alternate food such as Paul and. Back to our alternative prey. Because the crops are not always there with the past. That the at enemies can eat if they need alternatives. Also what. Natural enemies need is shelter a refuge. They need it in the summer. When it gets very hot in a crop fields. We also need it in the winter when I might not be a crop and it's called. They might need it. To get shelter for pesticides. And it could also use. And need shelter for tillage. So it's good to have the buffering of facts off semi natural habitats near crop fields or also. Up to distance is a one to three kilometer because natural many natural enemies can fly. So landscape. Matters. And this shows a landscape. You see a tree rolls along roads. You see a forest batch. You see different kind of crops and. Different elements in the landscape. There will be providing different resources for natural enemies and they can buffer. What happens in any one single field. Now to measure how much biological control you've got and how it depends upon the landscape. People use techniques and. They call it. Using Sentinel prey descends on all it's a word from. From the military it's a soldier that sent to enemy lines to find out what's happening here to Sentinel is a poor prey. And this case it's a AG of. Of the moss. And the agast expos in the field to see how much of biological control. Is going on and this is done in many different landscapes to see the landscape of fact. In this case with the. The Ags of. The cabbage. But us he say. This quite a difference in how much appreciation you've gotten different habitats. Predation in the roadside high predation in a ditch bank. Hibernation and hides but not so high predation and brussel sprouts it's already indicating that the crop is a difficult environment for natural enemies and. That semi natural habitats are better environments. So here are the images. Off. What our. Habitats with higher pressure of these natural enemies saw the roadside. The hedge. And the flower strip. But of course the respectable over. Of these habitats to the crop fields. In a review. They compared. I mean me abundance in. Complex landscapes and. Simple landscapes and it did that in a literature review and. They were scoring for every paper whether it was higher. The same or lower. In a complex landscape compared to a simple. And usually you find more anime So seventy five percent of the cases. More enemies in a complex landscape. Some cases is the same and rarely is it lower. If you look at the past pressure. The effect is not as clear cut. Almost half the cases. Lower pest pressure. In a complex landscape. Quite a number of cases. It's the same and. A few cases it's even higher. So it's indicating that it's not a simple solution to make the landscape complex. Making the landscape complex can contribute to more natural enemies that's likely what is really suppresses the past. The puns. And you should watch out that you're not stimulating your past by providing. Alternative habitats for the past. Now do. As I said the empirical. To quantify landscape of facts. And to also find out how far it is the fact goals. It is done with sentinels. And it's done by selecting approximately twenty sites. Spread over a large region. At each site. Measure natural pest control with sentinels. And then. Did euthanize the landscape. To see how the landscape varies between the difference. Twenty sites or you do dots in different distance classes. From where you have placed the sentinels and then you look at the relationship using regression. And this was pioneered by tier Charnock and he's shown here. He's from gutting a Germany. Here's an example study by my colleague Felix Bianca again. This is a caterpillar off of the Diamondback Moss a very important pastor worldwide. This is the adult Moss here's the Paris to tow it. And here are the sites in the now the list as you see those sites are scattered all over the country it is due to really sample in different landscapes. What is going on there. And here are two sites. This is the site. And the Polder area. So that is a very simplified landscape it is almost one hundred percent. Arable fields and has very little. Natural habitat. Here is a much older landscape. Smaller fields. There's forest. And this grassland arable land. And then here there was only seven percent parasitism. Because that landscape is not supporting person. It's very well. This landscape. Does support there is it always very very well and this could very well be related to the forest because the forest has a lot of caterpillars. The parasite though it's going to use those caterpillars and the spillover to the crops. This is the overall picture of such a study with twenty sites. And what you see is that if there's more forest edge so that's the interface between the forest and the surroundings. You can't. More parasitism. There's generally an increasing trend. But what you also see there is enormous scatter. And this is important to consider the landscape helps. The landscape contributes to. Biological control. But the landscape does not give you a full guarantee that there will be good biological control. Here's a landscape with a lot of forest edge. And the amount of biological control is. OK. But it's may not be enough for the farmer. Summarizing the landscape composition. It effects the ecosystem surfaces. For instance biological control. Here I've not talked about pollination but there are also effects on pollination. Very similar effects and. There are more functions. The landscape change that you can get because of changes in the economy and a value of crops. If you change the landscape it affects the ecosystem surfaces and if the landscape becomes very homogeneous. It also affects the ecosystem services. Area stick us or of multiple functions for instance supporting pollinators buffering pesticide emissions. Preventing erosion. Production of Widow biomass and. A static or cultural values. So. There are a lot of benefits. Of these habitats and all of those benefits need to be considered and added up to see what is the overall value. That economic analysis is important but caution is needed because some important values cannot be expressed very well in monetary terms so you really. May have to consider. Yeah. Maybe this is the value in terms of money. And this is the value. In terms of my appreciation of the landscape because if it's culture it's aesthetics and so on good. So that was it for. Today. Little clip. It shows the relationship between landscapes and ecosystem services in particular biological control. And we see it with more diversity. We get more services. Thank you.",

                "text": "Hi My name is Selena from the tests. And then in this next few minutes. I will tell you about a roll of soul nutrients in relation to cooking and safety and the immense Yeah. Which nutrients of foods may be of influence. You know as a short list of some that have been investigated. But in this clip. I will only focus on those written in red. So the only cuts refits Yes it's. The be five immense. And fights I mean the. Poor nutrients. I will first tell you about their nutritional sources. About the mechanisms. And on the total body of evidence based on observational studies. And into fencing studies. To start with the omega three fatty acids. They are Poti and said to eat its fancy as its meaning that they have a very long chain of carbon atoms with multiple double bonds. Mating making them quite flexible. Those investigated in relation to cotton safety Colline are the fairly long chain so. Twenty or twenty two carbon atoms and names. E.P.A. or D H A with their short names. They are mostly found in fifty fish. Such as. SELMAN or mackerel. The brain is a very fancy organ. Sixty percent of the dry weight of the brain. Is fits. And the ha. Is a very important components. And as you can see in this figure. Increased. Only cuts promotes several. Mechanisms. That's not good for optimal. Brain functioning. But to the observational studies say. The numbers on the slides are from a review from two thousand and twelve. So the current number of studies will be higher. However this is not the main message of the slides. I want to show with a slight at that time. Out of the nine core sectional studies that looked at a higher. Oh my guts refits Yes it. Into a core status. Six out of the nine. Showed a beneficial Association for a higher in say core status. With cognitive decline. And so when the. And of the twenty eight prospective studies. Twenty one. Showed a beneficial. Association. So it allots majority of the studies showed beneficial. Associations. How much fish. Did cease people. It's. As can be seen in this figure. About one fish meal per week. Showed a beneficial. Association. If you would eat. Two fish meals per week. No not much additional benefits. Was shown. If we then look at the intervention studies stats can infer causal effects. And that she was Omega three fatty acid supply mentation in their studies. This is a meta analysis of. Ten randomized controlled trials. Not all of them could be compared because of different outcome measures. But what was shown here. Is that in that there was a beneficial effect on different cognitive. Domains. So much as shown here. Attention and processing speeds. But also on short term memory. And what was particular. Was this effect on the specific domains force only shown in cognitive flee impaired in the field Ewell's. But not in healthy or demented participants. Then I'll make a shift to a to B. Pfizer mance. Those mainly investigated are folic acid and fights I mean B. twelve folic acid is found in green leafy vegetables fruits or whole grain products. Whereas fights I mean beats wealth. Is mainly found in dairy products such as milk. Meat eggs or fish for the fight amends are important co-factors. In the remet elation of whole you know acid homocysteine. To prevent high homocysteine. That could lead to increased. Apple souces and know its existence see increased platelets active facial. And increased. Amyloid. And so the important components of. Amyloid plaques and tangles stats are correct touristic of Alzheimer's disease. And also they could lead. You know. No Ronal that's the observational studies. This review. I include it's thirty five covert status with a total in of individuals. Of fourteen hundred twenty one of those studies for considered of good quality. And seven showed protective. As a shade of a higher fights I mean the status and less cognitive decline. What was specific in this studies. Was that was that. Association was more consistent with specific markers of fights I mean B twelve status. If we then look at the trial evidence. This is a meta analysis of two thousand and fourteen. That included eleven trials with cognitive data. On twenty two thousand individuals. It was shown that. Because of the fights maybe twelve supply mentation. The homocysteine levels were successfully decreased by twenty eight percent. However even though this decrease of homocysteine. No effect was shown on cognitive performance. Not on individual domains so not all memory. Speeds. Or execute a functioning. But also not. Global co-ordinates if and shooting. Then we shift to fight I mean the the last nutrient that I will discuss in this clip. Our body can synthesize. Its own fights I mean D.. In the the influence of certain lights. But we also consume it. By for example butter or fish. As you can see in this figure. Verified to mean the is in the middle. There are plenty of mechanisms on how fighting in the woods. Extort beneficial effects. In the brain. That's also why it is a whole topic. Of research in this area. But what do the studies. Tell us. This forest plots. Is based on thirty seven. Observational studies and tends to Dish for comparison in this plot. Because those were ten that used at least the same. Cognitive outcome. And it's. Shown that those with a higher. Fights I mean the status also has a higher score. On this cognitive tests. Furthermore in the same meta analysis. They showed that those with a high fives I mean these status. Also had less Alzheimer's disease risk. In this area L five to mean the Nobel the signed randomised control trials. Yet. So if we summarize all those studies. For the omega three fats Yes it's. The OPs of all observational studies overall. Showed protective associations. However for the trials a positive effect was only shown in Cochrane safely. Impaired people four to be vitamins. It was more mixed forty observational studies. And the trial so far did not show. A lot of effect. Fights him indeed. That's also means shown as protective in observational studies. And Nobel the science trials have been performed yet. So at that moment this moment of time. It's too early for specific nutrient. Recommendations were directed to coke and safety Klein and dementia. More research is still needed. So after this clip. You have learnt about so nutritional Ric's risk factors that may be relevant in the prevention of course if decline. And the immense Yeah.

                "text": "Hello everybody. This clip is on the analysis of life they balls. What is that. Life tables. Well first of all the purpose. The purpose of life tables is the analysis of life tables is to estimate the intrinsic growth rate. Are that we know from exponential lodges to girls. For a population based on the life history of individuals. So the life table. Is the life history of individuals so. Not all individuals in a population of similar births and thus rates. Younger ones are not reproducing but to survive very well that they become reproductive they get more babies. Maybe they're. There does rate is already increasing as they get older. Reproduction will taper off will become less and they will die. Over time. Not to grow also for the population. So are it depends on the composition of the population in terms of the number of individuals. In the different. Age or size classes. And the characteristics in terms of life and death of each age or size class. Now how can we calculate what a population as a hold us. Based upon what the individuals to. This is what the. Life Table. Is helping to do. Now we will introduce the topic was an example and the example is for the green peach if it. So does the green peach if it. And we use a very simple experiment. To introduce the idea of. The life table. In the experiment. The researcher put twenty seven. Newly Born a fit's individually all the leaves. Cabbage slaves. So we have an experiment with twenty seven. Cabbage clouds and on a certain stand. Leave. There was a single if it and is single if it was followed. Over time. Each of the twenty seven. To see if it was still alive. And if they were getting any babies. If they were getting babies. The babies who are counted and then after counting the babies were removed it's a very sad experiment that so often then. In biology. So we start with twenty seven. We go to twenty six so this is a bad luck if it's already dying at age four. Here's a not a bad luck if it then. We stay at twenty five. We drop to I think twenty two to twenty to seventeen. So this is a survival curve. And. After thirty five thirty six days. It's over. So it's. Five weeks and then. The last if it has died. How many how many babies are getting well. Initially. If these are not getting any babies it's on day six. That there is the first baby and the. X. is here. It is the reproduction it is expressed in the offspring per our mother per day. And if it is for the mothers that are alive so. It's only counted for the modest. That are still living the matters that have already died. We're not considering them when we calculate the reproduction. So reproduction goes up to approximately five babies promotor per day. And it's like that for approximately a week and then it becomes a little less less less less less until at five weeks. The process is over. So if I would ask you at this time. What is the intrinsic rate of the population. What is the proper proportion. By which a population will increase. Per day. Will you be able to answer that you are very smart if you can answer that. Now the idea of. The life table analysis was introduced by Elsie Burch in the paper in the one nine hundred forty so it's already a raga all technique. And he used certain assembles that we are still using and population ecology today. And these symbols are not here yet. Actually I'll skip a slide. They're here. These are the symbols of. Elsie Birch. X. is the age. L. X. is the proportions survival. Now you remember we started with. Twenty seven if it's here. Here's twenty six O L X would be twenty six. Defied by twenty seven. At this time here it would be twenty five to fight a by twenty seven. Etc. So it is the proportion of a life. At age. X.. You can also see that as. What is my probability. As a newly born. If it. To reach age. Let's say this is eleven. What that probability is twenty five. Over twenty seven. Because that's what in the cold heart. The safe is have done. So Alex is the proportions of awful. And X. is the number of nymphs. Per mother. Per day. So this is the measured offspring for tomatoes that were alive on a certain day. Defied it by the number of mothers. And then. From decent numbers. We will actually calculate three things and. They will be introduced one by one. The first thing that is introduced is. Is calculated these are not. Is the net. Reproductive number. The new. That's reproductive number. And I should first define what is really is. It is the average number. Off all spring. Per newborn. A fit over its entire life span. So it is the expect this reproductive output. Often a fit. And you can calculate it. When it's just born. And the way you calculate it is. It's pretty straightforward. It's simply taking into account what your probability that you will become one day old. Two days old three days old. Etc. So you calculate the probability of reaching a certain age. I remember. That was L. X.. And you also calculate. If you are alive at this age X.. What is your reproduction at that age. And that reproduction is. M. X.. So you multiply. The reproduction. At age. X.. If you are alive. With the probability of debt you will be alive. And this is then your expect its reproduction at age X.. At your time of birth. And you are adding them all up. You adding them up for days zero one two three four five. All those ages. In the future. And that is your. Expected lifetime reproduction. So that's the net reproductive. Number. Are not is a very important number and. Disease epidemics because if are not is less than one. It means that. Per individual. There will be less than one individual in the next generation so it means that the population will decrease. On the other hand if our knowledge is bigger than one it means that for an individual in this generation there will be more than one individual. In the next generation so the population will increase. Now. Are not. Is important. Population growth. But it's not the only thing. Important for population girls. It's also important to know how quickly does one generation. Follow on. Another generation. How much time elapses between generations. OK this is also a N.D. analysis of birch. He defined a generation time T.. As well. Something complicated as the sum of each. Tarbes. Expected reproduction at an age. Divided by. The total expected reproduction. Now what does the formula mean. What it really means. Is it is the expected. Age of the mother at childbirth. Because what you're doing in this equation. Is you take. L X M X.. At any age. So that is expert. Expected reproduction at an age. You multiplied with the age. And you add it all up. So that gives some summation of. H. times. Reproduction. You do find it by the total reproduction. So what you're doing is you're calculating and. Weighted Average. Of age. You're calculating a weighted average of this X. and a waiting factor is. How many offspring you get. At that age. So this is what Birch. Used as the measure of. Generation time. Now if we combine. Are not the net reproductive number. Wasted generation time we can calculate the intrinsic rate of increase. And that. The formula for that is here. Then our equals. The longer rate I'm off. Are not. Defied it by this generation talking. Summarizing. The lot of stable analysis. It is based on a cohort of female. Newborns. We followed this cohort over time. Until the last one has died. And we count the number surviving. L. X.. Is the proportion of a live at age X.. At the same time. We determine the number of female all spring produced for each a live mother. M. X.. Is the average number of daughters. Produced by a mother. At H. X.. If she is alive at that age. Then we calculate the net reproductive number. And it's the sum of all the products. L. X. X.. To calculate the generation time. We do it by calculating the average age of the mother. At childbirth and. The formulas here. That is. T.. Generation time. Is one over our not. Thompson mation. Of H.. Tom's. Expected reproduction. At that age. Finally we calculate the intrinsic rate of four people a sion for cos that from the average life history off individuals as our equals logarithm. Of are not. That's here. If I had it by T.. So this is how L.C. Birch solved the problem of. Cockle ating the growth of a population. When we know. The life history. Of individuals. Thank you.",

                "text": "Hello everybody. This clip is on population growth models. We present only two models today. It's the exponential growth model and although just a gross model. These girls models. They represent in principle. The key processes that a population will experience. So I'll walk to the board here. First of all there's. Individuals coming in that's immigration. And individuals can be leaving this emigration. And the example here is. When they've it's now and. If it's are in a crop of course still reproduce still got babies. And that's birth. And that is an additional term of. Influx into the population. But of course there's death as well and they can die of old age or. Of just getting crummy and they can also. Die because predators are coming as you see here with a lady beetle. Coming to E.T.A. if it's. Now. If you look at. Population growth process. Usually what's being done. Is that people focus on the birth and death process and they ignore. The simple population models immigration and emigration. Of course that's not realistic. But that's how. Population girls models work they focus on the internal dynamics of the population. So we focus on the birth death. Axis. Now if you focus on the birth. That's axis. The figure is simplified. And then the equation does being written it's a very fundamental equation and. Population dynamics is the exponential growth equation. And here this is really to get to. Shocks. This is the. The rate of growth. It's D N. Over D.T.. And usually. We will say D N D T. What does that mean. D N D T is the difference. That's what the letter D. means here. The difference in an the difference in number that you get. Per unit. Difference in talk. So as. Time elapses. Your numbers will change. So how do they change while they change because of birth and the change because of death. If we keep it very simple. And we will say well if we get more parents we get more babies. And if we get more parents we also get more parents dying. So let's go back to the question. The rate of change of numbers is burrs mind is that. If we keep it simple we issuing that birth. Is just some kind of. Relative burst rate. Times the number of parents. And the number of deaths cases is relative to us rate times. Also the number of parents. What is really means to be here is the number of death cases per parent. Per unit of time or. You can also see it as. The probability per unit of time that an individual. Will give birth. That's the birth rate. This is relative death rate. That's the probability per unit of time that an individual. Will die. What is now the overall population growth rate. Well. It's the births minds' the death. And we can write it as a B. minus the times than. And then the shorthand notation is our times and. So the rate of change. Of the population. Is some kind of constant. Are talking to the population that you have and is all or is the intrinsic rate. Natural increase. That's right and here. Intrinsic rate of increase. It's a very famous number. And when people develop theory on this and nine hundred forty S.. They consider this is something intrinsic to the population but actually or the species. But really it varies with the weather. With the quality of plots with with just anything so it's extremely variable. So to know the intrinsic rate of increase. Is interesting is that clear. OK good. So we made a equation for the rate of growth. And that equation expresses what we believe. The process is like. So it's about the rates. But we cannot calculate the numbers using this kind of a question. To get the numbers. At any time. And that's written here. The number at a time T.. We would like to have a formula. Now this formula. Is derived from the exponential growth. Equation. As a rate equation by. Integration. The integration is in the lecture notes are not going to integration on the blackboard because I don't have a blackboard here. Also I don't think that lecturing on this is so useful. You can read it so I look back at how this works. In the notes. But this is the end result. If you have this previous life. This kind of. Radio question. The rate of change of numbers is proportional to what you have. This is the equation that you get for the numbers the numbers. At a time T.. Are some initial number of times the power of R T E. Is a number two point seven something. And are times T.. Is the product. Of the intrinsic rate of increase. And the time that has elapsed between. This time and. The initial time. And then number increases will usually look like this they will increase steeper and steeper. Why are the increasing steeper and steeper That's because the rate of the increase. That is really the slope of. A line that you can draw. Through the points. The rate of increase. Is proportional to what you have. The more parents you have the more babies you get. That's exponential growth. Now to get the intrinsic rate of increase of the population from a time series of numbers. You need to do a transformation on it because it's going back to the previous slide. If you look at these points here. The curved line. It's difficult to see. The intrinsic rate of increase. But if you take longer it himself the numbers. You can see it. Readily here. It's written mathematically what happens if you take longer atoms. So here is again the exponential growth equation. And T. is and not times into the R.T. we take the longer events of the left hand side. We take the longer it himself the right hand side. And then. We need to apply rules. Of working with logarithms. One rule is that the longer it I'm off. Eight times B. is the logarithm of a plus the logarithm of be. Another rule. Is that if you have. The longer a them of eight to the power of B.. That is equal to be times the longer it I'm of age. You can find it in a lecture notes. These rules are applied here. So here I have to look great I'm off and not times into the power of R T. And I say. Well this is actually equal to the longer a time of the first part here. Plus. And I would be the longer a time of T.. But that would turn out to be. Just simply R T Because logarithm and. Exponential function are in first functions. So if you take those logarithms. This is the slighted you get. You know we have the luxury of an order a logarithm of. Density. Or the population size. Here we have time. The series of points. Has become more or less linear. If the points are on an exponential trajectory. And then. The slope of that line. Be. This will be the intrinsic rate of increase. And you can calculate it readily. You can calculate the intercept. Which is the longer a time of the initial number. Initial density and and the slope. Is the natural. Is the intrinsic rate of increase. Now. So far for the exponential growth model. Now the exponential growth model is very simple it has a very simple idea and. It's attractive and useful because you can issue. The assumptions to be true for a certain amount of time. That the number of births will be proportional to the number of parents and the number of death cases will be proportional. But you are actually your issue meaning that things are unlimited. As the population is growing. According to exponential growth it will keep growing and growing and growing. So you can calculate for a fits that if you let them grow without limits they were covered the earth in one year. So it's absolutely impossible for population girls to do this. So exponential growth will be constrained by our pool limits to the population densities. Resources are limited and then you can get the logistic roles model. So this shows a. Trajectory to squares. Which is exponential and another sort of directory. Which is that V.A. ting. And where the population seems to reach him kind of ceiling. Now the equation for this kind of limit is Gross is the logistic growth equation. Again. You see a rate here. The change in number. Per unit of time. So population growth rate. The first part is just like the exponential those are times on the same. Intrinsic rate of increase. But here is the limit or it says that. As population size increases. This factor will become smaller. And if. Population size an equal Scape which is the upper limit for the population. And this ratio will be one and one minus one is zero. So then the growth rate is zero. So this equation specifies that as the population increases. The limiting effects on the growth rate of. The resources. Which become limiting is getting more and more important. If I go there for a look at this figure here. Then we can consider that. Our Times and here. That is really. The driver for gross. The more the greater and is the steeper the girl's rate will be. And here the space for gross a still very big but the space for growth the room for growth. Are getting less alas. So. This limiting factor on the girls will become more important an issue approach the ceiling. The girls will stop. So in this model. Growth is proportional to the population size. And to the room for girls which is K.. Minus an integration leads to the logistic growth equation and. This. Senior notes. And to read the parameters of this equation. You also need a transformation but this time we're not using the longer it him. But we're using the low get. The low get. Of the population density. Is defined as a low grade them off your population size. Defied it by. K. minus an. So population size over. The room for growth. And this ratio will change. And then you will linear. Linearized the. Sick with gross rate and you can again read. Our last check. OK. I didn't put it into figure but it works just like the exponential. OK Dan summarizing what did we see. We thought to population growth models. Exponential girls and logistic roles. Both are widely used to analyze plant disease epidemics and the growth of pest populations exponential growth is based on the assumption of constant life history and unlimited resources. And the intrinsic rate of increase are is the only parameter in the exponential growth model. It expresses the proportional increase of the population per unit time. Exponential Growth cannot last. There's always something that eventually constrains photographs. A plant to value. K. also called carrying capacity sets the upper limit to the population size in a logistic model. Growth Rate diminishes. As the population approaches. K.. And both models are wrong. But both models are useful. So you can see that in the exercises. Thank you very much.",

                "text": "My name is on the uniform the best. And in this clip. I will tell you about. Pencil held in this case dementia. And the prevention of dementia. There are different risk factors. Against dementia. There are some fixed. Risk factors meaning that you can change them such as. AIDS six. Or genes. There are also some extra genius factors. It's just calm on to your pet such as a head trauma. Depression or social factors. Additionally there are some modifiable. Basic factors. For example smoking. L coal consumption. B.M.I.. Physical activity or diets. These are all. Lifestyle factors that you can change. In this clip. I will tell you about defectors. That are. After Reds. Full size. Except diets which will be in another clip. To start with one of the fixed. Risk factors. Which is age dementia risk. Shop increases or it's with age. As you can see in this figure. It increases. It doubles about doubles about every five years. Starting at one point five percent. At the age of sixty five and over at the age of over ninety. The prevalence. Is more than forty percent so almost all of the population. Another fixed risk factor. Is gender. Dementia is predominant in women. Which can be seen in this figure. On the left the graph. Of men is shown and on the right. The graph. Of women. And both the number of cases as well as also the standardized rates put out since individuals is almost double in women. Another fixed risk factor I.D.'s. Dartrey so-called. All time with genes. Percent all in one and two. And the Emma Lloyd's precursor protein. Gene. These are rare gene with. Ations. Accounting for about five percent of the cases. And usually early on stands. Meaning that people get the man chair at their relatively early age. There's also the A.P. for a while which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. If people have two of those a four L.L.C.. They are homo scientists. For idea for it. They have a fifty to ninety percent higher chance of alzheimers disease as compared to those people who only have one L.L.. Who have a forty five percent chance. Or the general population without any for a while will have a twenty percent chance. This makes to. Having the E.P.A. for a while a very important. Risk factor it's the seconds one. After age. If we then look at some of the potentially modifiable risk factors which are shown in this table. Here is. Population. At your bootable risk or that part is shown that stands for the number of cases this. That is attributable to deaths. Risk factor in the population. You can see. At first. That's low educational attainment is worldwide forty percent. Making is one of the highest risk factors. What can Furthermore be seen is that if we take all those factors together and we assume. Independency of those factors. Forty nine point four percent of the cases can be attributed to those risk factors. However they are not independent. And but if we take that into account. Still. Twenty eight percent of the cases can be at two to two dose risk factors. Meaning that's a change in lifestyle is really important. In the prevention of dementia. I will go into one of the other important risk factors into more detail. This forest plots. Shows. The results of a meta analysis on fifteen. Observational study. Yes. And the result is that. High level of physical activity was shown to be protective against cognitive decline. With eight thirty eight percent. As it's also shown here with a hazard ratio of zero point six two. They also looked at studies with a low to moderate. Physical Activity and. Even then there was still a protective protective role of thirty two percent. In summary. After this clip. You have learnt about some fixed and no nutritional risk factors. In the prevention of dementia. Thank you.",

                "text": "Hi My name is Alina from the rest. And in this clip. I will tell you about mental health. Or more specific about cognitive decline and dementia. The definition the consequences. And the prevalence cognitive functioning is one of the functions that declines with age. However this is different per individual. At first. We all have a different. STARTING POINT of course. Cognitive functioning. Which is pointed out with a. Besides that the moment of. Decline is also different per individual. Which is pointed out with B.. And additionally the rate of decline is also different. Pointed out with see. These three factors together. Determine when and where and. And whether a person. And in the gray area. And when the diagnosis dementia or Alzheimer's disease is made. So what is dementia. It is an umbrella term. Describing a variety of diseases. That develop when nerve cells in the brain. Die or no longer function normally. Also Misty sees is the most common form of dementia. Responsible for sixty to seventy percent of the dementia patients. All the major subsides are first killer dementia. Which is the second most common one. Or Louie Louie Body Dementia. Frontal temporal lobe dementia or a mixed type of dementia. Which is a mixture of the above mentioned. Types. All timers diseased the most common form. Has been discovered in one thousand nine hundred six. By a German doctor called a lawyers all the time are all timers disease. Is correct arised by plex. And tangles. Those plaques and tangles more or less. Eat away the brain as can be seen on the. Own little on the top sides. Is caused by the. Tangles no of February tangles. Which are aggregates of the protein inside the cell. There are also Emma Lloyd plex. These are deposits. Of another protein called. Emma Lloyd Bedser and those are around to sell around to neurons. The Plex and tangles are only physical by my crossed by a microscope piece are only off for person died. So only then it can be made sure that the person has all time or C.C.'s. So how have is it diagnosed them. Now different ways. Usually it starts when the person starts to experience. Memory complaints. Itself. Or that a close relative. Is pointing it out. Now. In the clinic at start. Several mental status this will be performed. Ranging from some screening tests assess the minimal state examination. Or the clinical dementia rating scale. To more domain specific. Now up so-called logical test focusing or for example memory or at tension. Additionally a neurological exam will be performed. Focusing on motor and neuron functions and. Brain imaging will be performed. Such as an M.R.I. scan. Which is the picture. Over there. Or a PET scan which is to picture over there. What are the consequences of all timers the C's also missed the Cs course of strangers in memory. Behavior and the ability to fink clearly. There's a serious loss of quality of ability especially the higher mental functions at later stages. People also become disoriented. In time. Place and person so they don't know where they are and who they are. And they have problems with simple daily tasks such as. Pushing your hair or. Brushing your teeth or combing your hair. They also personality changes such as people can be. Home anxious or. Or angry. This all happens over a course of about seven to ten years. In the end total care is needed and also most disease is fatal. Thereby it is one of the major causes of this ability and depends. Dependency among all the people worldwide making it also one of the most expensive. Diseases worldwide. The prevalence and incidence of dementia. Worldwide are almost forty seven million people with dementia. As has been estimated by the most recent report. Of Alzheimer's disease Internet shill. Published or guessed two thousand and fifteen. This amount is expected to decrease. To increase to one hundred thirty two million by two thousand and fifty. About every twenty years the number of people is doubling in both high income. As well as low income countries. This is mainly due to aging of the population. And it implies that every three point two seconds and new case is occurring. Can the disease be treated. In two thousand and fourteen. Clinics and his colleagues before. Litter to review all drug trials in this area. And they observed that ninety nine point six percent of the drug trials failed. So at this point of time there are no medications to cure or stop the disease. Only so in that's reduced the symptoms. Also there are relatively few trials seen the magnitude of the problem. This shows that we have a relatively large problem but still a lot of research to be performed. To disentangle the physiological changes. That underlie. Dementia and. By combing through our treatments for the disease. After this clip. You know what dementia is. And you have learned about its consequences. Diagnosis. Prevalence and incidence. Thank you.",

For modifiable risks. Such as physical activity. One can take action. Age. Is a major risk factor. It's hard to change the majority of frac to occur in people aged fifty years and older. After that age. Incidence rates increased steeply for fractures at the hip spine. And trees. Overall. Women are more prone to fractures than men are partly because of hormonal changes occurring around to meno polls. One of the risk factors that can be modified to physical activity. Are in it in physical inactivity. People with a sedan three lifestyle are more likely to have a fractured and those who are active. This is illustrated by reason me that analysis involving twenty two Cold War Studies. From me to certain percent for. Risk Reduction. Can be derived. So for all the people.

                "text": "Hi. Today we're going to talk about some ancient knowledge. Which is still very useful today. We can talk about that we thought was total. And this is about persuasion. How do you get your message across in here to three important concepts. Eaters. Logos and battles we will discuss them all together first and then go into them one by one separately. Each us. This is about making your speaker. More trustworthy. The question is should I trust this person within. So it's about the speaker. And we have logos and logos is proving a truth. Or apparent so. Showing that your message it sound. Does this make sense. But those. Is steering the emotions. It's making the message memorable. This is move me. And why do I need to remember these are questions audience could ask themselves. So it us. Here you see a picture of the president of the USA. So what makes him so credible. Why we trust him. This is what ethos is about this witness. It's an appeal to. Trustworthiness. Which is about the authority. And the honesty of the speaker. For example reputation is a very important one in here. If you have a reputation. There's already some authority. Most of the times in there. Sometimes it's also a lack of authority. Also the character of the speaker is very important. You should shows things like good emotions and. Connections. You have to relate to the audience. And then we have delivery as well the livery. If you have a very powerful voice. You have a very powerful body language. You come across much more authoritative than. When you have a very weak fois for example. So there are different perceptions of the various channels. The content. The body language. The Force. And very important that the. All in harmony. You can imagine that if I have a very strong body language. But a very weak voice. This is if you sense that there is something wrong. So you have to see that. All three elements. Are in harmony with each other or all channels. So take for example the setting here. But UK Obama stands there in front of flags. Which shows a lot of authority in a suit. Which also is very authoritative. So in all these races is to us and but also for example if there is a professor who says. This is very untrue. Then you are likely to believe in is that when. Some junior researcher said it. You might well take it into question. So the locals. This is about the correctness of the argumentation. With logos to try to prove that your message is sound and. Consist of evidence and reasoning. So data. Facts figures. But also argumentation. Important here is that you relate. The facts. To the reality of the audience. For example if I talk about climate change and I want to convince them that it's really necessary to do something. If I go to drowning. Island. Then I would use my facts of. Rising water. But if I go to the polar regions I would use that the temperature is really rising so you have to think about which facts you use for which. Circumstance. It's all about expressing your argument in the appropriate forum for the. Given communication method. And audience. And then part of us. Is about the audience in motion steering them. And connecting with them. And you try to make an emotional affection towards the objective of your presentation. With and the audience. So you try to connect with the underlying values here you see a beautiful example of. Martin Luther King. With his speech where he is really doing this. Using as well our very question at the livery and. Making a claim that the measure is an injustice all helps. Steering the emotions of the audience that I make a memorable connection with it. So you have different appeals to each of us. Logos and battles. But how can you use them how you do your race your thoughts for example. Well there are different ways. Titles for example. Accomplishments. But also language delivery. And like I said the character you're free a fair mindedness. Or your sincerity. And we have logos you use these. By using facts. Data. Figures. But also theories and. Even citations as well. And battles. You can use emotional language. Examples emotional examples. But also shared identity. Creating between you and the audience. So you both feel connected in the end. The center of attention remains. The audience doesn't matter what. In which part you look. But. Each of Logan about us. All need to be related to your audience. So what do they believe in what do they trust in what to do what this. What do they think is the truth. And what are their values. So if you use them all. You will be very persuasive.",

Also showing you the teachers involved. The details of the exact planning of these modules will be announced in the beginning and often told that this is just to give you a first introduction. Why it condemning skills. Well in the first part of this monster to focus is mainly on acquiring new content knowledge. And by the assignments you will process does knowledge. And this is to give you as much knowledge and insight as possible under the topic of study. Academic skills try to improve one's ability to used and. Knowledge gained in an affective way. It is important that the skills have an academic quality. The skills modules are focused on finding. Communicating and writing about the gaining knowledge in an appropriate way. You're going to learn certain rules on how to gather process and spread knowledge. You will receive specific guidelines on writing academic papers. Presenting clearly referencing. And critically reviewing literature. Also you're going to practice working together an effective way. Online. Provided by guidelines. Your course moderators will be. Doctor engineer young gay scout from the mosque of planned breeding and. Dr engineer of those early don't look so it's a form Oster. Of nutritional if you demure logy and public health. The course moderate this will be really your first contact person. They will follow your progress on the dive your skills you're going to be told they will intervene when necessary. When you work in teams or example. And they will assess your level of competence in the diverse skills. So they. Those are the faces you're going to see a lot. But for the different skills modules. We give we give five different skills modules. There will be different teachers. Involved and those will be the ones you will see. In the videos and in the content matter. Of the skills. It will be. The five topics will be. Information literacy communication interaction. Presentation skills. Argumentation skills. Scientific writing skills and project planning and management. Some of these skills modules run. Throughout the two years of the master. Like communication interaction others like information. Literacy will be finalized. In the first eight weeks after the First Aid Week from the start of this monster. So it's different for. Topic. When you will finalize the module. On it. For information. Literacy. Doctor engineer Mario not Nkrumah she's a information specialist at the library. She will tell you all about using the library and information sources that the library provides. And then this course. You will learn how to use a digital library. You will develop your skills in searching obtaining the relevant literature. For your subject. Area for communication and interaction it will be me. This is a very broad skills module containing diverse elements such as communication skills. Online learning skills. Feedback skills meeting skills. Personal qualities and pitfalls teamwork. But most important for this training. The skill of self reflection. And I will be the person guiding you through this scientific writing. This module. Provides a general overview. And some theoretical background. On various aspects of a condemning report writing such as. Report structure and parts. International standards for illustrations and referencing. Then the use of English language for increased readability. Dr Curtis Barrett. Will tell you all about this. For argumentation. It will be me again. Teaching. The main part of this skill. For some this will be in the on campus week for some this will be an online module. And it gives theory and tools for the same persuasive argument ations. You will observe others and. You'll get peer feedback on the way. On the way of your are. How you put forward your argument. Several aspects of persuasiveness and structuring your arguments will be discussed and practiced. Both in theory and practice. For presentation skills. Will guide you through that you will get insight in your own strengths and weaknesses in online presenting. And providing and improving your personal profile performance. Erica high amounts. Will guide you through the basic skills on project planning and management on home. How to organize projects and keep control of the process. You'll start to understand more about. Project budgets and project monitoring and control. If you have any questions about any of these skills for the general you have to go to the course moderators. But if you have very specific content questions then go to that specific teacher and they have lots of more information about it. I hope you really enjoy the skills modules. And joy of learning progress could. Good luck with it.",

                "text": "Hello my name is John from Conn and I'm in the laboratory for the pathology. In this clip I would like to discuss how parasitic plants hijacks plant micros are signaling pathways. I will focus specifically on root person the plants of the family. Of Oregon Casey. These are parsley plants that are not able to produce roots themselves and therefore are obligate parasites. On roots of other plants. They're also referred to as a broom ripe. And I will discuss especially. The genus triger. And the genus or a bunky. That form an important. Problem in agriculture. It is an enormous economic problem. And a threat. To food security. In Europe. The Middle East and in Asia. Losses have been reported in. Different crops. And in Africa. Striker and oral bunky. Challenge. The production of sorghum maize. Millet rice and cowpie which are important. Staple foods. In Africa. Now the. Oregon Casey have evolved from autotrophic. Free living plants. And they have lost several properties that have made them to parasites. In this phylogenetic tree that you see. The closest relative to Oregon Casey is. Edginess called minimalists and. In the Oregon Casey. They have successively lost. Different properties. To become parasites as they are. So the genus try physio area. Is able to colonise roots of other plants but it can still produce some roots by itself. And it has retained photosynthesis. So it is a facultative parasite. Striker has lost. Root production completely and is an obligate parasite but it still has four percent to synthetic capacity. So that is why it's called the Hemi parasite. And oral bunky. Has lost. Reproduction. And it has lost for the synthesis. And therefore it is an obligate parasite called a holo parasite. And you can see the images of these plants. On the picture. There are many similarities between. The interactions of. Roup arsenic plants. And their hosts and plant microbe interactions. For example the production of penetration structures that through parasitic plants make. Are very similar in function. To microbial EPP of Soria. Then also the infection structures that are produced. Inside. Host routes to extract food. Are very similar to microbial House story or. Also there are resistance mechanisms in plants against. Root parasitic plants. And these can be at the level of the prevention of penetration. Or at the collapse of the feeding structure. And this resistance often involves. Resistance genes that operate through a gene for Gene interactions. And these resistance genes look very similar in architect architecture. To resistance genes against microbes. The life cycle of root person at plants is quite simple. The seeds of the plant. Are stimulated by struggle act on. To germinate and struggle act on is released from the roots of the host plant. Into the soil. And this. Stimulation of seed germination. Seed germination is essential for the parasitic plant. To actually succeed. The plant the person the plant then. Attaches to the host root. And it forms a house story in a feeding structure. That takes up nutrients from the host. And this allows the process to develop a chute. And eventually flower. And then. Lately. The seeds are produced. And they're released to the. Soil. Where they can remain dormant for many years. Struggle like tones are crucial in this process. And they are. Plant hormones. Of. A category of carotenoids. Compounds. And you can see in this image. An illustration of the diversity of structures. Of different struggle like tones that are produced by different plants. And there are slightly different biological properties also to the strike like points. So struggle like nonce essentially have three different effects. As I mentioned they used to germination of seeds of root parasitic plants. In the host plant itself to inhibit the branching of shoots. Especially in soils that are depleted in phosphate as. Occurs in many countries. And thirdly. Struggle act ons promote the branching. Of Mike a rise of fungi. That are beneficial creatures. And that. Develop an iteration structures. To interact with the host. Route. This leads to a very complex role of struggle act owns. Where the compounds. Are hormones in the host plant. To inhibit should branching. The concentration of struggle act on. Increases in. Soils with low phosphate content. And this automatically implies that plants will branch less. In such soils. That are low in phosphate. The struggle Acton's are then released into the soil. To stimulate the interaction with Michael Rice the fungi. And those microphones are beneficial because they provide the host plant with. Phosphate. And with nitrogen sources. But then the root parasitic plants. Have learned to recognize struggle acting as a signal for seed germination and. In a way. These intruders. Abuse the information that is meant to attract a beneficial organism. So the take home message for this subject is that root person it plants are bad. Guys. Causing enormous economic damage. They invade routes. And they tap nutrients from their host. The infection structures that they produce to achieve this are very similar to microbial infection structures. Struggle act ons. Inhibit Shute branching. Especially in the presence of. Low phosphate. But they are meant to attract the fungi that are beneficial. But on the other hand. They stimulate the germination of person he plants. So there is a delicate balance between. The micros ation. And the invasion by parasitic plants. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is John from Cannes and I am in the laboratory for the pathology. In this clip I would like to discuss the role of Fido hormones in plant defense. Just like humans. Plants of homo aunt's home and so they find a signal molecules that are produced in one tissue a cell type. But have an effect in a different. Tissue a cell type. And I'm sure you're all familiar with the classical fighter hormones Orks in. Cytokine in general like I sit and abscissa gusset. And these are involved in all kinds of developmental processes and in seed germination. And dormancy. I hope you're also familiar with the hormones. Struggle act on. Salicylic acid. Ethylene. And just Monica acid. And these are involved not only in development. But also in defense responses. And interactions with other organisms. Hormones can be produced. Can be transmitted through the vascular system or. By cell to cell. Transport. Ethylene however is a gas. And it can be transported via air outside the plant. The hormone salicylic acid. And just want to acid can also be methylated to form volatile derivatives. That can also be transported via the air. Plant hormones often work in couples. And in some cases there is. Antagonistic activity. And in other cases there is synergistic activity. And this leads to a complex situation where different interactions between hormones and hormone pathways. Leads to networks. Of interactions through CROSSTALK. And. It means that. Changes in one hormone balance. Can have multiple consequences. In other hormone pathways as well. People have studied the role of hormones in plant defense. By using both. Genetic and chemical approaches. And this is led to many new discoveries. For example people have applied. Hormones or hormone in him. It is to study the effect of this application. Or they have used mutants. That are defective in the production of hormone. Or in the perception of the hormone. Or the response to the hormone. And if used mutants that over produce a certain hormone. Or that. Overreact to a hormone. Even when the level is low. It should be noted however that these mutants often have very strange. Phenotypic. Features. So they have developmental phenotypes. In the left image. You see. Tomato never right mutants that are insensitive to ethylene and. They never develop. Beyond the Green stage of the fruit. So they never fully ripen. In the right image. You see are a bit obsessed mutants. C.P.R. one. And Ball which constitute a fully express. Defense reactions and. Homozygous mutants. Are extremely resistant to attack us but they are seriously dwarfed. Because they invest too much energy in defense. All these experiments. Have led to the discovery the three plant hormones are very important in defense. And those are sell a select a sit just Monica acid and ethylene. Now salicylic acid. Is essentially operational against defense against bacteria and by a trophic fungi. Ethylene is operational in defense against neck or traffic fungi. And just monic acid is operational in defense against insects and they could profit fungi. And in the red and the blue and the green image you see the chemical structure of these hormones. Each of the hormones activates. Different types of defense responses. And we can study this by looking at the expression of market changes that are specific for a certain pathway. In the image. You can see the. Gene expression that was measured in our beat up as plants when they were treated with. Salicylic acid or just monic acid. Or both. And you can see that if you are priceless Like I said to the plant. The Jean-Pierre one. Is highly expressed. Because this is a solicitous it specific market chain. In response to just money Gossett the expression of the P.D.F. onto gene is very high because this is a just minute. Specific marketing. And when you apply both compounds at the same time. You can see that the P.R. one gene is expressed highly. And the P.D.F. onto gene is suppressed. And this means that when the compounds are applied. Together. Salicylic acid is dominant. And suppresses the just Monica sit. Signaling pathway. To very important to note. The different attackers. In use different hormone pathways. And there are also attackers. That are able to produce fighter hormones. Whereas other attackers actually exploit. Fighter hormones. To their own benefit. There are three types of resistance to attackers. That involve hormonal signaling. In the left. Image you can see. Systemic acquired resistance. Which is triggered in vegetative plant to shew by. Necrotizing pathogens and. The resistance is also operational in the vegetative tissue. In the middle. You see the process of. Induced systemic resistance. Which is triggered by nonpathogenic rise of bacteria that. Interact with roots. But the resistance. Is mediated in the vegetation and in the right panel. You can see wound response. To nematodes that infects root. Tissue or to chewing insects to chew on the vegetative tissue. And this triggers a wound response. These three. Resistance responses. Involve hormones. Namely the systemic acquired resistance involves the signaling of. Salicylic acid or methyl salicylate. Where. As the. Induce systemic resistance. Involves the signalling pathways for ethylene. And just Monica acid. And thirdly the wound responses. Involve the signaling pathway for metal just night. Now in nature plants are challenged by many different attackers. Both the root system. And the vegetative tissue. Can be attacked by viruses bacteria fungi or my seeds. Insects mites or. Vertebrates. Suppose you are a plant. What would you do when you're under attack. Of multiple creatures. You would need to think about the situation. And reach a decision. And. Reaching those decisions. Requires. Home on mediated defense. So in the image on the left. You see a plant. That is obviously under attack. And it needs to consider whether it's being attacked by a chewing insect or. By a fungus that causes Niekro tick lesions. It needs to think about the signal signatures. About volatile compounds. About decor strategies. And also about the presence of beneficial organisms. And it needs to weigh all those types of information. To make a wise choice. I would like to illustrate that. By means of the salicylic acid pathway. In order to defend themselves against bacteria. Plants need to sell a silica acid pathway so if a bacterium is around. It must be able to recognise. The attacker as being a bacterium. The recognition then must lead to the production of salicylic acid. But not the entire going to stick pathway of just Monica it. The essay mediated defense. Then. Confers resistance against bacteria. But also as a side effect to buy a trophic fungi. The solicitous and then suppresses the just Monica as it mediated. Defense pathway. Which are operational against insects and them adults. So by choosing to activate the defense against bacteria. The plant becomes more susceptible to insects and them adults. So when you're under attack you need to choose a weapon. And hope that this is a good choice. At the same time. Attackers manipulate the hormone mediated defense. And I'd like to illustrate that. Also by means of the cellar select as a pathway. Because. As I mentioned this defense pathway is active. Against bacteria. And by a traffic fungi. But there are bacteria that are able to produce Corona thing. Which is a chemical that. Structurally resembles. Just Monica as it. And the corona team is recognized by the receptor for just monic acid and induces just Monica acid signaling. But that suppresses the pathway for salicylic acid signaling. So essentially these bacteria sabotage. The defense pathway. That makes use of salicylic acid signaling. And this suppression then makes the plant more susceptible to bacteria. Which is exactly what the attacker wants. So there is a continuous chemical. Enzymatic an information warfare going on between the plant. And its attacker. The take home message for this subject is that. Plant hormones provide very in for. Important information for plants. To reach fundamental decisions about their development. Or their defense. Hormones can operate independently but they can also act synergistically. Or antagonistically. And mutant plants have been used to actually study the role of hormones. In different processes in plants. Sela silica said ethylene. And just Monica acid are very important. Hormones. In many defense responses and. It should be noted that one difference pathway. May go at the expense of other defense pathways. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is young from Cannes and I'm in the laboratory for the pathology. And in this clip I would like to discuss how attack is manipulate plant immune responses. Immunity is defined as a state of biological defenses that is meant to avoid. Invasion or infection. And for induction of immunity it is important that organisms are able to recognize non-self substances. Animals have both an innate immune system. As well as an adaptive immune system. With learning capability. And with memory. And they have a circulatory system with mobile defender cells. Plants or ever only have an innate immune system. There's no circulatory system of they have no mobile defender cells. But each plant cell is equally able to defend itself. Plants can recognise non-self molecules and. Some examples are listed here. They can recognise molecules that are derived from bacterial cell walls or bacterial enzymes. Or they can recognise. Components of fungal cell walls or membranes. As well as fungal enzymes and collectively. We refer to these molecules as. Pathogen. Associated molecular patterns or bumps. And some people used. Malek microbe associated molecular patterns or months. The recognition of these pumps. Is mediated by receptor is in the plant membrane. That function as a radar. And the recognition leads to prompt triggered immunity or P.T.I.. Here are some examples of pumps and there Receptus some. Bacterial molecules or fungal molecules or all my seed molecules. Occur in the upper plastic space in between plant cells. And they are recognised on the outside of the plant cell. By receptor proteins. By means of an extra cell or a recognition domain. The binding. Of the pump. To the receptor. Leads to the transmission of a signal to the inside of the plant cell where a signaling process leads to the activation of defense. That we call. P.T.I.. Obviously. In order to be successful the attacker. Must suppress this immune response. And it can do this by means of. Effectors. And effectors can be low molecular weight compounds. Or proteins. Now effect this can operate in different ways. They can avoid the recognition of pumps. By binding to microbial cell war fragments and thereby masking them. Or they can inhibit. Enzymes that the plant releases. To generate these pumps. Also the effect this can suppress upon perception. By destroying the radar of the immune receptor. By means of protease activity. Thirdly effect this can suppress the down seems. Downstream signaling a pathway by the force for a later protein kinase is that they're required in the signaling process. In addition effects can degrade. Defense molecules that plants produce with anti microbial activity. Which we call fight two elections. And these affect this concludes the fight to elections. And finally affect this can manipulate. Gene expression in the plant. By being targeted to the nucleus. And act as a transcription factor. Obviously suppressing the P.T.I.. Is good for the attacker. And this results in a process that we call affect are triggered susceptibility. Or E.T.S.. The plant now. Is suffering. And the attacker wins. And this puts selective pressure on the plant. To come up with a solution. In order to achieve this. Plants have evolved. Receptors that enable them to recognize the effect of molecules and the recognition. Leads to a very rapid and strong defense response. Which we call. Effector triggered immunity. If the effector is located inside the plant cell. The recognition is obviously in the cytoplasm. Any of the effector occurs outside the plant cell. The recognition is extracellular. The receptor that mediates E.T.I.. Is called a resistance protein or are protein. If the plant manages to induce. E.T.I.. This is obviously good. And this defense response. Obvious often involves a local cell death response called hypersensitive response. And it is accompanied by the accumulation of numerous defense compounds in defense mechanisms. If the plant wins. Obviously the attacker surface. And this puts pressure on the attacker. To find a solution to overcome this. And in order to do that. Attackers have evolved new affect those that can suppress the hypersensitive response. And lead to affect the triggered susceptibility. And the plants evolve. A new receptor. To recognize this new effect or. To again. Induce. Effect or trigger immunity. This illustrates the continuous battle between a plantain attacker in the left here. You see. Ramp recognition by receptors that triggers. P.T.I.. And the plant is resistant. In the middle panel. We can then see that effect was suppressed immunity. And it leads to affect the triggered susceptibility and the attacker. Is winning. And then we have our proteins. That have evolved into plants that recognize the effect for activity. And that mediate. Effect are triggered immunity. And the plant is. Resistant again. And this succession of. E.T.S.. And E.T.I.. Can occur multiple times. So this has led to the proposal of an evolutionary model for plant immunity. Which is called the zigzag model. And in this model. Initially. Plants were only able to recognize a pimp. And trigger P.T.I.. To mount a certain defense. And the defense. Lead to resistance. And the attackers then evolved in effect or. To suppress that resistance. Leading to susceptibility. Plants evolved in our genes. The green gene illustrated here. That recognizes this effector and mounts the E.T.I.. And leads to resistance again. Then the attackers. Evolved a second defector that was able to suppress the reaction of E.T.I.. And again lead to susceptibility. And this put pressure on the plants. To develop a blue are gene which recognize the second effect. And again restored. The E.T.I.. And this can continue for several cycles. And hence the name. This exact model. The take home message for this subject. Is that the plant immunity involves the recognition of non-self molecules by plants. Leading to pump. Three get immunity. And the attackers then use affect us to sabotage this P.T.I.. Leading to affect or triggered susceptibility. And plans evolve. Resistance genes. To recognise those affect us. And mount. Affect the triggered. Immunity which puts pressure on the attackers to evolve new effectors. To suppress the E.T.I.. So there is a continuous genetic battle for control over the plant immune response. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is Mike and often I work for the center of cop system analysis of the university. And today I'm going to talk about. To excise that you will be doing. In our the content of this presentation it is that will start with short introduction to our. In our studio. And other will will explain a little bit about the two exercises that you were going to do. The goal of the first. Exercise is to get a feeling for the effect of sample size on the variance of the sample means. And we're going to use data. Of the Colorado potato beetle. In a potato field for that. And the goal of the second exercise is to get a feeling for the relationship between spatial pattern and. Sample. Unit size. And the frequency distribution of the sample counts and with sample unit size. We mean. The size of the sample unit so that's where you sample one plant a square meter or two square meters. And with the sample sayst. We mean. How much impulse you to take. And for to let for the second. Exercice we're going to use computer generated data on seats that spurs away from their parent. For the next two exercises he will use our to analyze data. Generate data and put three Schulze are a very powerful language. And environment for statistical computing. Simulations and graphics to fun to just of are that it's open source. So you can use it freely. And there's ample Mulisch online and I would advice you if you don't know how to do something. Ask Google and look. Because there's always. Other people that's off the same question and this is the general tip for programming. Use Google and look online. Because there's a lot of people that have the same questions. And to use our studio. This isn't as. User friendly interface for our and. It's also free ware so you can download it for free and. It makes it easier to use our links to assist in so our in our studio. Are in the last light. And there's also an instruction fell on blackboard. How can you use our. In our studio. This is when you open our studio for the first time. You will see. The name of your first one of our. This changes every free free. Month so this will be outdated to at the time you will see this. This is cool to console. Here behind this bracket. You can type. Anything you want so for instance you can use it just like a calculated. You type one plus one. And you will get the answer to. But you could also say. I want to quit the session with are you typing Q. and with two brackets. And then it will stop here. You can find the open science. And with this. This is one of the advantages of. Are you don't all have to type in the same commands all the time. But you can use a script in a script you can save to commands that you used before and you can open it again in the next session and. That will look like this and this is the first example that you will going to do. This is called distribution Colorado the are and this is the text. Of to exercise that you were going to do. And this will start with some green lines. And this. Are just comments for you for your information but are will not use this. And the. The ones that are in black. Or in in another color. Article months that are values and will execute. And if you want to start there you want to run a line and want to do this for you. He will just. Select one line. Or a couple of lines and press. Control and. Are at the same time. And then it will execute these lines and. Furder. In this exercise you will have to read in a data set. So it's very important that our notes from watch which. Folder. He shoot a download that. So that's. You have to set the working directory. And you have to set it to the rectory. And the folder. Your data file is in. And if you do this. Be sure that you take into account that R. is very sensitive for. Spaces so you have no spaces in the name of the folder and. Use double the Shish. Instead of one. To Mark foolish. In foolish. And if you do this you can type in there. And then also to bracket. And if the a file with the data is there. Then you can go furder. Here you. If you execute these lines. It will read in the file cool Beatles. Twenty five. The all to see as feet and will store it in a fair bill. Or in a table. Beatles. And that is what you can see here. All the data that you read in is here. And all the fairy bills. That you use. Is in this part so that these are the values in this is the data and. If you execute it. You will always see the same amounts. In the control. And here you see. For instance. We use symbols. To make this graph. And this will Croft this will appear here. But if you want a bigger graph to look at you will pressure. Sume and you will get a bigger graph in a different. When. Oh. If you want to know more about this function symbols or a different function. That you use. You can type in a mark and then the name. Symbols. And then there will open a new top. With help. And it will give you extra information about this function. This is always this not a lot of information here but if you look on the Internet you can find more information. You're going. The first exercises you're going to look at the F. ect of simple sites. On the ferry and of the mean. And we're going to look at the Colorado potato beetle data. For this we compare tree temple so ISIS. So instead of looking. All the values. From the field where we got the Mena Fife want to phone in the France of. Eleven point nine. We're going to randomly take only five. Of the simple units. Or only twenty five. Of the simple units. And only fifty. And we do this five hundred times. We'd replicated five hundred times. And but look what it does to the meaning of the sample that you take and to defend every inch of this mean of the sample that you take. And that's what you're going to do in this exercise. And in the next exercise. You're going to look at this effect of spatial pattern and simple unit size all on the dish of sample counts. And for this. You will generate data of addition of seats. And you will start with to run the placement of one hundred C. tortious what you can see here show this is just a random placement of these on the Cheech or fish and. Each of the seed sources will produce on average with a post on process. Twelve point two individuals but four samples. For the spatial pattern if you want to make a difference spatial pattern. You can change the number of seats or. That you can take or you can change the number of seats. Or itching. Originating from the. The source code. Is deceit. Distributed in the area. We assume that most of the seats will stay close to a parent so it will to have approximately a normal there should be you should the means of placement this is zero so at me. Means that the highest fraction stays close to the parent. And then the standard deviation of to its normal distribution is two point five meters. Which means that seventy percent. Will stay in a in a radius of two and a half meters. Around to the parent. And ninety percent of the seats that. From this parent will stay in Fife meat dish. Around this. Parent. So most of them stay close to the parent so it is just for short distance. Dispersal. If you want to make it better in that this less close start you would have to increase this. Standard deviation. So that it will become more random. But in the exercice we will give. Example fellow use that will generate different patents. The direction of the movement of the source is drawn from a distribution between zero and two pi This means that it can move in each direction. Away from the parent that links to download our studio. Given here. And it is also a useful link for an infer further introduction into our. This is not for discourse but it's. If you want to know more about our it's very nice to look into this story.

                "text": "Hello my name is Mike and off and. I work at the Center for coop system of the official fastening University. And today I'm going to talk about the negative binomial distribution. The negative but nobody. Distribution can be used as a descriptive model for natural phenomena. That can cause clustering of individuals. Close to each other and. It is useful so for statistical tests and something methods. And it's suitable for many different situations in which. Organisms are not theirs to Butte it. According to a purely random process. Over simple unit. For instance. If there's a habitat that they prefer. Or where. When parents and offspring. Are in the same unit so that the offspring stays close to the parent a good the temple of address the distribution. Welse the potato field with the. Colorado potato. Beetle in it's a female. But they cannot update the beetle. Lays up to thirty X.. At the same time. Then the needs one leaf. And some plants will receive such a cluster and other plants will not receive cluster. Therefore. The number of individuals in one sample unit. Will tend to be clustered. And due to discuss the distribution. The ferry in special ample unit. Will be larger than the mean and this is a correct three sticks of the neck they've. But no meal distribution. Justice for the distribution. The probability of finding expression months. In one sample unit can be calculated. With the following formulas for negative but no militia Buescher In the mean. Is equal to new. And the ferry ns. With two new times. One. Plus. Beautified by K.. Which means that it's always. Larcher. Then you sort of ferry and his larger than the mean. This is an extempore of recursive function This means that the fellow you. At X.. The Pens on the fellow you. The previous value sort of. X. minus one. So. To be able to calculate this. You have to have a starting function and this is the first function that you need. You need to calculate function for X.. Is zero. And then you. If you have that. You can plug it in here and then you can calculate a failure for X.'s one. And that's it. Maybe look. Maybe looks complicated. But we will calculate it. In the next light and. You will see that it can be done. Again. The two functions. If you can see here is to fill you. X. is the number of. Specimens in one sample unit that you want to calculate the probability for. And this was the number of the previous step. So we will first Coke late. The failure for X. is one. And for this we take a median of two so new is two and we take a failure for the clustering. K. is one. And then we try to find the fail use for exist Ciro X. is one and X. is to end just calculate this. So for exists hero. We are going to use this formula. So we decided that. Came must be one. So it's one. The fight at plus one plus an emu was two two and two the Power case showed it was also one. And then you get one third. And this is the value that you want to plug into the next formula. So if we going to calculate B. is one. X. is one week. Going to place the. X. is one here and. We going to pluck. In the one. Here. And then we go and the coke laid that again. And we get to mind. Of. As a value. And then we can use that again for to calculate the chance of. The probability of finding two specimens in one simple unit. Then we plug in the two here. And we used to valued at the found before. Again here. And then we calculate the new value in of this. Eighty five at by fifty four. And this is what you can do yourself. And we going to use Excel for that. And this is plotting this graph and. In the next slide you see the same profit also in green. For case one and all these spatial graphs are made for a mean of two. So we have a spatial domain of ten by ten meters. And we have a simple Krit of one by one meter. So there are two on that. In a few deals. In each of these. Spatial the mains. But the distribution is very different and its distribution is very different. Because the values for a very different here. Case. Point two so that's very small so it's fairly clustered. Here it's one so still some clustering. Here. It's becoming larger to value case ten. And you can see that the that it approaches. Across on the strip you should so it becomes more and more random. It can also see this here. If you would look. Just randomly. Take one sample unit out of this. Distribution. You have a very high chance of finding a share. Oh but A to B. does there. If you take a random sample unit here. You still have some chance of finding. Zero potato Beatles in in your sample unit. If you take one here. This chance become smaller and that's just what you can see in this group. Probity. Of finding a certain number of. But they to be deals. In one simple unit. And he can see that the one with a large Katie. Approaches. To probe with ability distribution. For us on this to be sure. And in summary. The plus one process shows the complete random process. Is fairly rare in nature for the C.S. and wheat. In this distribution. The Fairy ation is equal to the mean. And this means that there is no preference for location and there's no preference for being close to each other. Apache there is more common for pests and diseases in the pitch there should be in the ferry and his higher than the mean. And this could be caused by favored Habert habitats or clustering near the mother and. Also possible. It's a regular. If to view sion. So that the spaces between individuals are almost the same this. Occasionally happens and this is mostly happening. When there is competition between individuals or when they have territories. And in this case. The mean ferry ation is smaller than the mean. Incl clue Shion the distribution is off best diseases. And wheat crops. Is often patchy. And the negative binomial. Can describe. This but she distribution. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is my love. And today I'm going to talk about fossil. Distribution the problem. The properties of this distribution. The push on this abuse in it's a very basic distribution. That is suitable for counts. In of organisms in space. The persona distribution describes the probability of finding of. Expresso Ment's. Of an organism. Exactly expressions of an organism. Pair shampooer units. So the simple unit could be one plant or a square meter. When individual. Specimens are distributed completely lend them. Over the simple units and with completely random. I mean that they have no preference for a specific location. And they have no preference for being close to. Organisms of the same species or being far away from. Organisms of the same species. We generated a possum distribution. With it in the computer. And we did this by introducing. Fifteen hundred individuals and. Randomly assigning. X. look Asian and. Why a location T.. To each of these individuals. And this gives a random spatial pattern of individuals and. If we overlay this. With a simple grit. We could look. Each sample unit is two by two meters. And if we look at this graph you can see in some simple units. There are no individuals. In some temple. Units there are a lot of individuals. And there's a lot of. Sample units that contain only a few individuals. And we can plot this. In an autograph. Where with a spatial pattern. With a Class A cell phone so a small vault. Is a few individuals. A large bill is a lot of individuals. And just like the previous picture. You can see. There's a few a lot of them have only a few individuals. And some of them have many individuals. And a lot of them have. And in the immediate. Amount of individuals. If we knowing. Going to look at the. Mean number of individual sampled fair sample unit. It's two point four. And also the ferry insist two point four one and it says. No coincidence because with a random distribution the sample mean is equal to the ferry and and. It is a coincidence that it's expected the same you don't always expect to be exactly the same. But they should be very close in the same order. And if you know look at this graph. You can see the frequency of the number of individuals. Bear simple unit. So and. Black lines. Are Did they tell from the generated data. And the blue lines are. The frequency for it up for us on distribution and you see a very good match. Not a complete match but the very good match for the fossil distribution. In the practicals. We're going to do some calculations on the person distribution. Because the calculate the probability of finding expresso ments in a simple unit. For certain. Mean. And we can calculate that with this function. And the properties of the person distribution is that the mean is equal to lump that the variance is equal to a lump. Distance affair Ians is equal to the mean. And we're going to. I will show you some calculations with this function. And first I want to say that X. is the number of individuals. That you expect in a certain. Simple unit. And lump is the mean. And this X for Tauriel. Is. You can calculate. By multiplying X.. With X. minus one. And until one so if you have three factorials when you would. Multiply a tree with two and one. And you would get six. And now we're going to do some. Example calculations. So we have to same function again. And we take long ties one. And we try to go collate the probability for finding Ciro. One or two individuals. In a sample unit. And that's what is here show first we will try to. We will calculate the probability of finding Ciro individuals. In a simple unit. Then we do. Eat to the minus minus one. And one was the mean. Times. One. To the power. Ciro. Because we are looking at excess Ciro. The fight it by zero factorial and Baikal French and this is also one. So we would get. Opioid three six. And if we do it again. Just fill in one. Four X.. We would also get zero point three six eight. And if we now feel into. Four X. in this equation. We can't open point eight four and we put that in this graph. So this is the probability of finding. Zero. Individuals in the sample unit. One individual in sample unit and. We also plotted this for other. Means. So this black line is the same one that we calculated before. Now we also. Calculate that it's for. Lump. It's a half so a smaller. Mean. And. We also plot at this. In a spatial graph. So we made a spatial graph of ten by ten meter. And we have a cent per unit of one by one meter. And we introduced. Fifty individuals there. So then you would have a mean of a half. Prayer. Square meter. And you see that if you have this sample unit then you would just randomly. Draw one sample unit. From this graph. There would be a very high probability that you would draw. Ciro individuals. In this sample and. So this is more than sixty percent chance of finding several individuals in a sample unit. So this itch. Coincides with this blue line. And here is a lump there is one that we calculated. Before. Here is a month to Soviet. Two hundred individuals in this. Spatial graph. And then there's a slightly higher chance that you would find one or two individuals and. In your sample unit. And if you would even increase the mean. The mean. Of the distribution to five. Then. On efforts you would most likely find four of Fife individuals. In a sample unit. Which is also reflected in these Bruff below. In conclusion. The force on this abuse. Is based on complete friend the Miss. And this assumption is phrase. Often not correct for pests and diseases and weeds in crop fields. Thank you for listening.",

Of festivities and wheat in. Crop fields. And in this first picture you can see a maze field with it. We in between the rows and there's really large patches of weeds. And also some patches that are still empty. Best the season weeds are almost never. Homogeneously distributed in a field. They are patchy. There's also can still be seen in this picture below. And the specialness has consequences for. Best control. For decision making because when patchiness. Increases its becomes more and more difficult to assess the correct. Pest density. And it's also important that health also has consequences for pest. Equality. Because if you would introduce a natural enemy of the best in the field. If the bestest. Clustered the enemy can have more difficulty in finding its host in the field. In this graph. In this picture. You can see. Rows of mace and patches of wheat in between. And these are clustered. And also on the smaller scale you can see cluster shape of species in this field so you have a cluster of. Train a podium. Album. And some specimens of. At the pics. But. About Tila next to it. So also the species are clustered in a landscape. And if you look at the whole field. There are differences between species and also this difference. Francis can be caused by Saul. All of thirty also by the dispersal ability of the seeds how far they can disperse away from the parent. Whether they stay close to a parent or whether they disperse far away. And also buy something to feel like where's the interests of a field. For instance in these fields. The entrance was in the top of the fields. And you can see that the density of the best. Plants. Is higher in this. Top of the graphs. And for this species here. Can a podium. Police bear limb. You can see that the density. Is higher in one side of the field. And there were differences in soul quality. In this field. That could affect this. Why is it important to know the distribution of a pest. The decision to take a corrective action like spraying. A field or releasing. By control agents. May be based on pest density. Sampling can give information on pest density. Important considerations for sampling are is how to make these observations how big should be the same pool unit to two sample individual plants. For pest. Disease or shoot you. Sample per square meter. So what is a correct. Sample unit size. And how large should you simple be to get a good position. And this is depends on a very ability to hire to ferry ability the more samples are needed. And last but not least how much variability should we expect. This is. This depends on the species. Of interest. And not much only its quality can give you information that can be used to set up a good sampling protocol. In this. Practical we will look. At the Colorado potato beetle and look at this distribution in a potato field. The color out of potato beetle isn't a major pest. In potato fields. A female Colorada potato beetle can lay up to eight hundred eggs. In her lifetime. And she usually lays closer for about thirty. Eggs and they need one leaf often today to plant. And then she will move to a not a plant to randomly selected in the field. And lay a not a cluster of eggs. After some time these eggs hatch and. Turn into larvae. The larf a feat on the potato. Plant and also the adult feet on the potato. Plant and they can completely differently ate and potato plant. After the larvae have eaten enough. They form a pupil a that falls in the ground and. They survive into the ground until the next season. And we're going to look at their distribution in a potato field in the next light. This is a potato field. On the expects this you see the row number show from the bottom of the graph. To the top of the graph. You see a potato row. But with potato plants. And each thoughts. In the graph. Three percent. A section of. Seventy one centimeter wit potato plants. And it represents. How many potato Beatles were counted on these plants that were in this section. Of seventy one centimeters. And if you look at this graph you can see. Simple units that have only a few potato beetles pressure and also some simple units that have no potato beetles pressure and. And also a lot of dots. Where are a lot of individuals frail. Counted and. If you look at this graph. You cannot directly tell. Whether it's a cluster distribution or. Random distribution. You will have to look at the mean. Of the simple simple. Unit or death. Variance in the number of beetles. Sampled spare units of safety one centimeters. And we will see that. In the next graph we are going to look into more detail. There we can see that in most simple units be found. Approx me Pfeifer slightly less or slightly more. But the to speak those freshened in this. Seventy one centimeter section of a row. And in some sections we found fifteen or more individuals. And if we now look at the mean number of potato. Beetle sampled per unit. This is five point six So this is really close to the Fife. That I mentioned. And the ferry and. Is eleven point nine So this is much higher than the mean. And if the. France is higher in the mean this indicates that there is a clustering of individuals within the sample units. So this will give a cluster distribution in conclusion. The density of. Best the season which. They ferry in space. As can be seen in the picture. On this flight. And sampling for quantification needs to take into account for your reality. Thank you for listening.",

                "text": "Why reflection. During our academic career you were asked several moments to reflect upon your performance. In this clip will tell you why this is seen as an essential skill for any academic professional. Involved any university employers of where graduates complained about the lack of communication and reflection skills. Actually it was sad that the university students were actually quiet. Were having a lot of content. So they really knew a lot about the content of this studies. Yet. They were not so much. Able to communicate that content. Effectively. And they were not so self-aware. About where they were good at and where what they could improve. So university. The university decided to put more emphasis. Emphasis on self reflection to become more self-aware and more communicative. About your own strengths and weaknesses. Also in the UNESCO program and. Lifelong Learning Program of the European Union at the same time it was the end of the. The end of the nine hundred ninety S.. There was a lot of emphasis on creating competent individuals. With lifelong learning programs. There was much more emphasis on becoming flexible in late. Labor market. So you had to be. Be aware of the competence if you were bringing from one place of work to another place of work. So you needed to be self-aware what am I actually good at next to the content knowledge I have. What am I actually good at Am I good at communication can I present can I we're Corgan eyes. Can I separate. Means from goals. Things like that you were able to really communicate about what you were good at and what you could improve. And lifelong learning programs. Put an emphasis on that. You know within the universities. Also because of globalization it is very useful that you know. You know yourself. Because when meeting other. Other people and you're not able to look at things different than your own perspective you're not so self-aware. Than it is very difficult to communicate in this globalized world. So therefore reflection on your own performance. Is essential. So what is academic reflection skills. Economic reflection is about observing analyzing your own behavior. It is about evaluating whether it was effective and pleasurable. And if not setting up a plan to improve and consciously try out new behavior to improve your performance. It is not only about behavior. But it's also about your thoughts. Analyzing your own thoughts analyzing your feelings and analyzing if those were pleasurable or effective and maybe you could even change. That. So it is really. Analyzing dissing the way. The way you think the way you behave in the way you feel. In academic reflection often also the focus is. Is On. Often the focus is taken on learning. So becoming aware of your. Your learning behavior. That is what really separates academic reflection from normal reflection. So reflection. Is about having it critical. Not in a negative or destructive way but. Through deep questioning. Into what and how we learn to perform. So it's about being critical on. Well how do I actually behave in wasn't actually pressure. Pleasurable wasn't effective. And how could I improve. Reflection leads to greater self-awareness. Which in turn. Is a first step to positive change without a process of actively thinking about or experience and questioning ourselves about what they mean. Learning often doesn't really happen. Because ninety five. Of what we do is habit. Not all our habits are effective or pleasurable. So when taking time to look back at them. We might ask ourselves the question Hey what. What actually do I want to keep and where would. Actually want to make an improvement. If we don't do that. This at the end of the day. We actually often. Next time do exactly the same. Even if it wasn't so effective. It also increases. The ability to take different perspectives. And taking different stands on the same situation. By reframing it. So awareness is not a laugh. Reflection should lead to improving performance. By using the outcome of the reflection. To inform your future practice. So act. Try out new behavior. Or try out new thoughts that might be more beneficial. And really look at your feelings and maybe. Reframe those type of feelings. So that you can become more effective. So we are learning deeper and Foster when we reflect. Because we are really living a situation where looking back. And we actively thinking about it and because of that it moves knowledge from our short term. To our long term memory. There's a tendency to focus on the negative with the reflection if we look back at a week for example and. You made two mistakes and the rest of the week went fine often we remember off this week the two mistakes we made. And not the rest of the whole week. That went fine. So with reflection. We can also have a look at that. To put our mistakes into perspective of the total view. So it can help you to take a more positive mindset. And with a positive mindset actually. We are more open to learning. So with reflection we put things into perspective. Perspective. And also looking at the positives. Also helps us to know what we can do actually the same the next time. So with reflection. We also look at the polls what if and not only at the negative. There are several places to look with reflection. And this is a model to show that. There are places so there are areas of your reflection you could say. You have yourself that's the I. You have teams. That's we. Working together. And you. Got it. The context or the the actual content of what you're supposed to do your tops. The things you have to deliver. Etc. So those are places to look when you. You want to reflect. These could be areas of reflection. So you could reflect on your own talents your own values your own faults. You can also reflect on our way of functioning our destroying of a team. What are we doing well together what not. Another place to reflect on could be your tough your tossed your the product you deliver is that of a good quality or not so there's several areas where you could reflect on. To look at. Well is it. Is it done in a pleasurable way and is it actually effective what we've done is it a good product. Etc. So these are the areas in between are actually interesting to look. It is about. Team reflection. So in between. How am I working in a team you could really reflect on hey what am I doing in a team. Or what is the team what kind of effect does the team have on me and is it. Positive or negative. You could also look in between well how. How am I working on this end product. And what could I improve. To it's. And how what how does the end product in for me and. Is it effective and pleasurable what I deliver. And with. You could also reflect on the process you were in the planning in a team how do you together work on the end process. Products and. That's also a place where you could look for reflection. Is it actually did we manage our time well as a team. Did we really make it clear planning together. Did we reach the outcomes we wanted. So. Team reflection is also an area to look. So make time for reflection. A piece of paper a pencil a mug of tea and a quiet five minutes at the end of the day could make all of a difference. For your learning. As a summary. Without reflecting there is a lot less for learning. Reflecting increases or self-awareness and self if it is easy. So good luck with your reflections skills.",

                "text": "Hello everyone welcome to this short video. About online learning. For this video we chose a very practical perspective. With some suggestions to starting learning online in an effective and pleasurable way. So let's look at Five Tips to work efficient create a study space. Don't underestimate the influence of space on your concentration. Prefer you create a comfortable atmosphere where you are relaxed. But focused. But whatever your situation is most important is that you minimize distractions during study time to maximize concentration and efficiency. Close all programs on your P.C.. Have everything you need with you. Your notebook your pen water and put away all the things that my district you like cell phone or your food etc. Set aside time to study. Schedule at least as much as you would in this classroom setting. After which you can evaluate and change your approach. Prefer you set aside by times by Ty's times daily. For example one hour now. One hour later. Blocking time for the things you have to read and assignments you will have to do. Take breaks while having planned time for studying keep in mind that you also need breaks to keep the concentration high. If you cannot concentrate any more. During a specific activity. And you do not need or want to break. Considered to change to a different online learning task. Read carefully. During toss careful reading is essential. There is no one to correct you so make sure you know exactly what the instructions are. It saves time later on and make sure. To be in stay organized. The priest structured course design already helps you a lot to manage and structure your work effectively. There are many advantages to stay organized during the learning it increases productivity. It reduces stress. And it enhances your creativity. So to summarize creates a nice study space plan time. I was to study. Take breaks really carefully. And stay organized. To keep up motivation there are also some tips. Work together. It is generally more difficult to get through the whole process. On your own. Then together. So get to know the other students show interest in them. And check on each check out on each other. Keeping in touch and feeling a connection with other participants. Or reaches the experiences of learning and it increases the motivation. And therefore it. It increases the chance of study success. Share with family and friends. Let your family and friends know what you're doing. It is nice to have some people to talk about your story and. Sometimes maybe even blow off steam. They might be willing to encourage you to finalize all your tasks. When nobody is watching or checking on you. It is of course easier to not do things. Just remember that laziness and under prioritization is lurking. When you're all on your own. So make sure you stay motivated by setting goals you're motivated for. And do not forget to celebrate your achievements of course. So share with fellow students. Show interest. She with family and friends. And keep your goals in mind. To get most of it. Out of it as Edward Young said. Pro Christian nation is the thief of time it leads to rushing later on. Which is detrimental to deep learning. So remember that you're doing this for yourself. So don't fall behind this is even more important than online learning because once you fall behind. It will be increasingly difficult to join and learn from the discussions and group assignments. The other students won't wait for you to get most of it. Put really sincere effort in doing the assignments and discussions. They're extremely valuable. And taking it up. Them up seriously leads to much deeper learning. In the end. It will all be worth it. So keep up with the speed of the course and dive seriously into the material and assignments provided. I hope you use these tips to your advantage and good luck. Learning Online.",

                "text": "Hi welcome to this now this clip. About cell directed learning. We specifically dive into the topic of self regulating. Because that's fight all in online learning context. Where there are no students and teachers physically at your side to support your learning process. And help to motivate you. We're going to talk about what is needed to manage your own learning process so what is it self directed learned. South directed learning. Is the ability to take control over your own learning process. It is about learning. Independently and making learning meaningful meaningful. To your situation. Here you can see. One of the most famous self directed known is known in history. Leonardo da Vinci. Well educated in art. He structurally observe the world. To understand it and was continuously eager to learn. And by this. Self directed learning he became next to an artist also fame is a mathematical in a world class inventor and are detected. So we're not all Leonardo Da Vinci's. But we can. Might be able to improve. Or motivation to learn and to keep or keep learning. So let's have a look at it. Self directed learning. Is accomplished by three dimensions. Interacting with each other. First of all is motivation. This is about your perceived value of learning. And your anticipated sess of learning. The second is self management. Implementing your learning intentions. Then come self monitoring the monitoring over performance and thinking and being able to adapt. This performance. So let's dive a bit deeper into these three. And start with motivation. Motivation is the willingness to give sustained effort. Needed to successfully learned. Independently online. High motivation is one of the leading factors in student success. What is your perceived value of learning. And how self-confident are you. These to keep these two factors. Are key to your motivation. Are you seeing and earning us something that. Is that is something you have to do that you actually should be doing. That would be good but actually you're not liking it or are you are you liking learning and. Are you actually self confident that when you're when you're going to to learn that you actually will reach a reach a success. Are you not so self-confident. That decreases your motivation because if you think I will start by I won't get it anyhow. Then why. Start. So your motivation goes down. So ask yourself the questions how how self-confident am I. And how do I look at learning to have a vision of liking it or not liking it. And maybe. Could you change it. To increase your motivation. So and. That will increase the chance of student success because highly highly motivated students perform better at the end. So make for yourself. Also the goals. You want to reach very tangible. Set clear intentions. Why. Remind yourself of why you're doing this master. For example if you know. If you don't feel like going for it. You start to procrastinate. Then. Remind yourself why you're actually doing it. Maybe later on. It will increase your salary or your. It increases the chance that you will be able to do research in your specific field of interest. So make sure you know why you're actually in this monster. And reminding yourself of that. When things get difficult sometimes and you don't feel like it. That itself builds your commitment and persistence. And when you commit and persistent. In the work that will enhance your. Your self-confidence as well. So you're and then opt in a positive spiral. Because when your self-confidence is enhanced that builds your motivation. Then the second dimension in self directed learning. That is about self management. And that is about taking control of the learning environment. To reach your learning objectives. No way to find everything. Like schedules like the blackboard like. Feedback from snow how it works. Have a good look at what a sign. EMMONS are expected from you during the week. And plan your learning process and. Most of also patients self don't overextend yourself. But also do not procrastinate. Because once you are looking behind it's difficult to catch up. It is not the same as a classroom setting. Online Learning requires a very proactive approach. So. Have a clear overview of the learning environment. Have a realistic. Penning and. Proactively ask questions and supply questions to your peers. And when you need support. You have to be really assertive and empower yourself frequently. To take control over your learning process. Then the third dimension. That is about self monitoring. It is the continuous monitoring and evaluation of your own performance. That and he and Hans's your learning things to manage or could be your concentration level the quality of your work. The interaction with peers. Identifying your personal learning style really help. Was the way I was thinking and contribution to the. What the way I was thinking contributing to this situation what kind of thinking. What kind of acting would have been more helpful. Did I integrate my new knowledge in a meaningful way to the context asked for or to my own Qantas. Text. So all these questions are vital to learn affectively. So. Continuously money storing reevaluating. Your own performance. And strategy. Reflecting on how you do it. And look at your own learning performance. Integrating new. Newly learned knowledge. In a meaningful way to the context. Being honest and critical. With yourself and make the content valuable for yourself so also over time you remember. They actually I've done this and it was me. Meaningful. In my own context as well because of that. So if you act if you think about it. But whatever you do. It's actually enhance your own learning you're not doing it for someone else. And you try to see it in. To make meaning of what you are and for your personal contacts. It will be. You're learning process. Then the last. Touched. It's not one of the dimension but it touches upon a participation. Studying alone without classmates or an instructor can leave. Some students to feel very isolated and frustrated. Students can help alleviate these feelings by logging into the Course day. Participating in group discussions reaching out been frustrated or confused and sending emails to share ask questions. And it's proven that actually being more present socially. Builds your deep learning. The connections people make during their learning. Are determining factors in the success of self directed learning journeys. Studies show that. Online participation and Hans's. Learning performance. So in action help is the motivation. And on a more social level. It helps also the learning. So as a summary. Self directed learning is about the ability to control and direct your own writing process. Key to it is motivation self management and monitoring. Participating. Actually actively builds your learning. Builds your builds on your deep learning. So I hope you will have a great learning journey.",

                "text": "Hello my name is young from con. I'm in the laboratory of fighter pathology. And in this clip. I want to discuss how plants can distinguish itself. From non-self. In order to defend themselves against attackers. Plants must sense the presence of the attacker. And respond to it adequately. They must know that there is a problem. That an attacker is nearby. So they must recognize it. By a sensor. They must generate a signal. That is process than transmitted. To raise an alarm. And activate genes involved in the synthesis of defense products. That effectively counteract the invasion. Or interfere with the reproduction of the attacker. In this clip. I want to focus on the recognition face. How do plants know that there is a problem. There are three ways of detecting this. Plants can recognise non-self molecules. Which do not occur in plants. And this serves as a direct recognition. Plants can also recognize that their cell walls are being degraded. During invasion. And the damage that occurs. Is picked up and. As an indirect signal of a problem. Thirdly plants can monitor. Crucial physiological processes. By guarding vital functions. Also in an indirect recognition mechanism. Which type of. Non-self molecules can plants recognize. There is a large diversity. Of components that can be recognized by plants. Such as the components of bacterial cell walls for gel in order to properly Secor eyes. Conserved bacterial enzymes. Such as the inauguration factor. E.F.T. you. Fungal cell wall and membrane components such as kiting. And of course role. As well as fungal enzymes. Involved in the degradation of plant cell walls. For example exile in Asian poly Galaxian ace. Finally plants can also read. Ignite effector molecules of attackers. That act as modulators of the immune response. And work. As sedatives. In the interaction. When considering this recognition process. It is first important. To be aware. Where these molecules are located. Because that's where they must be recognized. All the molecules in the green box. Occur outside plant cells and must therefore be recognized on the outside. The effect the molecules of attackers. Can occur both outside and inside plant cells. And therefore can be recognized in different places. If we consider the cell will damage the plants can recognize. This is illustrated by. The breakdown products of plant cell wall. Polysaccharides. That are released by the action of enzymes. Of microbes that degrade the cell walls. And an example is the ONLY GO collection ice released from Picton. Dido this is affecting obviously affects. Tissue integrity. And it destroys. Tissues and cells. But also the pectin fragments. Act as. Self molecules. That serve as damage associated. Molecular patterns. There are a warning signal. The only go go look for nights and all the cell will breakdown products. Are always located outside the plant cell. Plus a membrane and must therefore be recognized on the outside. Finally the vital functions that are guarded by plants. Are illustrated here by two examples. First there are. Signal transduction pathways that are important in the defense signaling. And they often involve. Protein kinase activity. The protein kinase activity is important in the transmission of defense signals. To raise the alarm. And. Pathogens. Can. Tamper with these. Signal transduction pathway. Yes. And plants are able to detect. The tampering with this pathway. So the monitor that the pathway is functional also their extrasolar protease is that can destroy proteins of the attackers. In the extrasolar space. So they are true defense products that counteract the invasion. And in some cases pathogens try to reduce this Proteas activity. By producing inhibitors. But the plant monitors the activity of the protease. To make sure that it is functional. And if it is tampered with. It is detected by the plant and. A defense response follows. The monitoring of these vital functions. Occurs in two different places. It can occur. Inside the plant cell. Such as the protein kindness activity in the signal transduction pathway. But it can also occur outside the plant cell. Such as for the. Protease activity. So how do. Plants actually detect all these problems inside an outside plant cells. They have Receptus. That are able to detect the problem. They recognize molecules ligaments. That are released during the attack. As a warning signal. And he's reset the proteins often. Recognize the leg and by a protein domain called a loosing reach repeat. Obviously the recognition must occur where the signal is. If the signal is outside the receptor must be in the plasma membrane with the. Loosing rich receptor. Losing rich repeat. Sticking on the outside. If the signal is. Intracellular. The receptor must be inside the Plaza and the L R R must be inside. The recognition then triggers a resistance response. Obviously this receptor like an interaction must be specific. It must be sensitive. And it must be fast. So here is an illustration of the architecture of receptor proteins with different protein domains. As shown in this slide. We can see on the left here. To interest seller receptor proteins. That have the L R R domain here at the bottom. And some other domains involved in the signaling process. They can recognise. Intracellular. Signals. Of a problem. On the right hand side. Are two Receptus. That are embedded in the plasma and brain. Here. And they stick with the. L. or R. domain on the outside. To recognize like and on the outside of the plant cell. And in some cases the. Receptor protein such as here. Has a kindness domain which is able to signal by itself. And in other cases. This protein with the L R R. But lacking the kind his domain. Needs an additional protein for the signaling process. And in many cases the receptor is that you see illustrated here. Act as. True resistance fruitiness in summary. Plants can recognise problems in three different ways. They can recognise non-self molecules. They can recognise signals of damage. And they can monitor vital functions. As signs of a problem. The recognition is often mediated by receptor proteins. Either. X. or seller or intracellular. And the Receptus of non-self molecules often act as. Resistance proteins. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is John from Conn. And I'm in the laboratory for the pathology. In this clip I want to discuss the plant cell wall as a battleground between the plant and its attackers. Plant cell walls are very complex structures that consist of three types of police like Wright's pectin. Cellulose. And he said those. In the image. You can see the white thick bundles of cellulose. That are interconnected. By Hemi Solo's fibers. In the black strands and then the white spaghetti in between is depicted the cellulose provide strength to the wall where respect and provides flexibility. And cell walls are highly dynamic. They differ between plant species. Between different tissue types. And even between cell types in the same tissue. The three polysaccharides. Are build up of sugars. And solos. Is built. Of only glucose. Whereas heavy cellulose is build of five different. Sugars. Namely run knows. Gallic those silos. A rubber nose. And minerals and pectin. Is largely made of got a chronic acid with some around nose and some silos. Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide on earth. It is built of a single. Linear polymer strand of glucose residues. And the strands will. Interconnect the hydrogen bonds to form fibroids. And these fibers then associate to a pair of crystalline complex. Pectin is the most complex polysaccharide in nature. And it comprises homo collection as its main component. And that is a linear polymer of galaxies like acid. Decorated with. Methyl groups and as a field rips. There's also run neglect through non one. Which is composed of an alternating chain of REM nose and got a chronic acid residues with sight chains of garlic dance. Robin and and Arab in your gullet dance. Then there's also run neglect on on too which is largely a linear chain of galaxy and acid residuals decorated with very complex. Different. Sugar site chains. And a solid election on which is built. Of a chain of us address and use. With silos. Residues. Site chains. And these different components. Make up pectin. In different amounts. Plants are walls. Are a very important target for the attack by enzymes of attackers. That want to benefit from the plant. The cell wall they could ation. Facilitates both the entry of the. Of the attacker. And the colonization of the plant issue. But it also provides carbohydrate nutrients that the attacker can use for its growth. And there are several of the grating enzymes that target both pectin and cellulose and Hemi cellulose. There are two types of enzymes. The endo acting enzymes that work by internal cleavage in the polymer. Such as. Scissors and they cleave the big molecule. Into two smaller molecules. The exo acting enzymes. Cleave the molecule from the end. And work like a Pacman to release one. Sugar monomer in every. Hydraulic hydrologic cycle. As an example. I've listed here. The breakdown of pectic polysaccharides. Where you can see the Pickton chain. Of collect on it as a dress and use. That is degraded by. Esther raises here. Cutting the site chain the metal group from the galaxy on it as it races you. And then there are two enzymes that act as. Deeper limb races. That cut the back bone here. The. Poly collection ace. Will hydrolyzed the glue because it bond between to collect on it as it residues. By the addition of water. And there are lying aces. That work leave. The glucose in. And between two receipts use. By the extraction of water. And these enzymes act in concert. To degrade. This complex. Substrate. And the same is true for many other cell wall based police record rights. Plants. Try to reinforce the cell wall when they're under attack. And they defend themselves. By deposition of. Finola compounds. Such as lignin. Or the deposition of the. Glucose polymer kilo's. Which forms a popular in the image. Here you can see a fungal saurian that tries to penetrate the plant cell wall. By means of an infection pick. And the plant is the positing. The colors. The pop. In a popular. Underneath the cell wall. To plaster the cell wall. And keep the fungus out. Leaving if occasion of the cell wall. Is mediated by the. Polymerization. Of phenolic compounds that are derives from the amino acid finial alanine. There are three different. Monomers alcohol can Freule alcohol and seen appeal alcohol. And they are linked. Enzymatic Lee. By Proxy days. The remaining hydroxyl groups. Can then be further cross-linked. To proteins or polysaccharides. To form a very complex. Impenetrable network. That this essentially. Very difficult to degrade by enzymes of microbes. The attackers in turn. Need to deal with cell reinforcements. By destroying them. And in this image you see in them a toad with a style of here. And this style it. Can actually brute. Brutally force its way through a kilo's plug. Here you see the starlet that has pierced the. Popular and has thereby gained entry to the plan cell and insect style it's made. Work in the same way. Microbes of course don't have stylists. So they need enzymes to degrade kilos and. Find their way inside the plant cell. It's very important to note. The plants influence the susceptibility to pathogens. By modification to their cell walls. If we consider the structure of the plant cell will polysaccharide make tricks. There are plants so will the growing enzymes. Acting on those Matrix's. And these are involved in fruit softening in cell growth in the obsession of organs. And in the germination of seeds. And this is all part of normal plan development. At the same time. There are pathogen proteins that act. And are able to degrade the cell walls. In order to decompose the host tissue or to establish feeding structures or to translocate. Effectors. Into the host cell. And this illustrates the complexity and the dynamics of the interaction between plants and attackers. In the neighborhood. Of plant cell walls. Cell wall damage not only causes damage but it also in uses defense. Plants are able to sense that their cell walls are being broken down by enzymes of an attacker. And the fragments. That are released. Are signals of danger. It is obvious that if you would see something like this in your house or next to your house. You would be notified of danger. And this is act actually were plants also do. They recognize these fragments as danger. Here is an illustration of the real life situation. A fungal Haifa. Tries to penetrate a plant. And it produces. Fully Gallic trace. Enzymes that are labeled here. With the pink. Circles. P.G.. These particular traces will. Lies The pectin in the wall. And they will release. All ego galaxy nites fragments of the electronic assett. That are then perceived by a receptor in the plaster membrane. And this receptor signals to the nucleus. That there is danger. And that. Genes must be expressed. To defend the plant. The genes that are activated. Our defense genes that are involved in the production fight to Alexis's anti microbial metabolites. Or in the production of quite an Asian gluconate enzymes and. Enzymes that can hydrolyzed components of the fungal cell wall. So these glue can isn't quite in Ace's are produced by the plant cell. They're released. Outside the cell and they will attack the fungal Haifa. Which is then. Destroyed. The only go go look for nights that mediate the signaling. Damage associated molecular patents. The take home message for this clip. Is that the plant cell wall is composed of three types of fully Secor writes that it can be reinforced with lignin. And or with Carlos. That the cell was a major target for hydrologic enzymes of attackers. For the purpose of both. Colonize ation. And nutrient release. And that the damage. To cell walls release is molecular. Signals that serve as warning systems to reduce plant defense responses. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Academic reflection skills. How to enhance your academic inflection skills. We all have certain behaviors. And our behavior causes a certain effect whether we like it or not. So by sitting for example still in a corner. You might think. Nobody sees me you actually. Also show behavior. And that also has an effect on. On yourself. And on others. So what we want to do with reflection is looking at our behaviors zooming in to that be her behavior and looking. If that. If you're causing the effect that you actually desire. You can ask yourself some questions for example. Is it effective. Or is it pleasurable what I'm doing. I'm an academic. Reflection. This is are some essential questions. The actual thing I'm doing. Is that effective. For me and for others. That I'm working with. Or is a pleasurable. Am I enjoying what I'm doing. If not maybe we can and harm something there. To make it even better. So with reflection. With reflection. Resuming in in our behavior. Ninety five percent of what we actually do do during the day. Is habit. So we don't have the habit. To look back at our behavior. And therefore often. We learn less. Effectively. And by if. Economic reflection you actually zoom in on what you're doing. We use. The reflection cycle reflective learning cycle of course. Made in one thousand nine hundred three. He made the circle and actually. You can improve your import. Performance by going through the circle. More often. Starting with the action so we all behave that's your behavior. The action. And then. Consciously looking back on the action so actually. How did I behave. And was a defective. Would die. What were essential elements of that behavior that. That could be improved or. That were actually nice. And if we zoomed. In into our own behavior. Then you might fall and you might fight elements. With becoming more aware of essential aspects of a behavior. We might think of creating alternative methods of action that might be more effective. And by doing that we would like to try them out. So. Trying out some new behavior. Number five. So the trials actually the conscious act you're trying something new out with an action is the unconscious act where you just do it. And you look back. Afterwards. But once you've done a trial and consciously tried some new behavior can look back again. And you can become aware again of some essential aspects and. By that going through the reflective learning cycle more often. This is also showing. Shown by this spiral. So with. Reflective learning. And wanting to improve your performance. You repeatedly go through this reflective learning cycle adapting along the way. Actually I tried this new and this works but this might not work. And you could look at skill. The skill of performing you could look at the knowledge do you have enough knowledge to perform better. Or. What is the attitude to use the things you would like to improve. If your attitude is I don't want to improve this I don't like this. For example presenting If you want to improve. A part of your presenting If you have to design don't like it. Then maybe that is the goal you want to work on. With setting up personal. With reflective learning. Setting a personal learning goals or. Are vital and. With setting. Choosing goals you have to think of a goal that is really motivating you. That is not too much in your comfort zone for trying to improve something you're actually already quite good at it you don't think it's so important. You fall asleep by trying so you actually forget. So try to pick. Goals. You would like to improve. That are actually challenging for you. That are your challenge so you feel motivated. Feted by. And you have some energy for it to improve. But don't pick goals that are too. Far out too far away for you don't. Don't make a plan of action that. Basically goes over your limit. Because that will really diminish your learning over time you'll probably stop. Be frustrated and don't want to learn anything. Again. So try to pick a goal. That really challenge you and motivate you to work on. Then we're going to set up these personal learning goals and we do that in forced. Steps. We first create a skill for each goal from zero percent to one hundred percent zero percent. We do not perform at all well. At this goal. And one hundred percent is totally good at it. I couldn't be better. So first you describe the topic of the thing you would like to improve. Then you make a full description of this full achievement. So how does it look like to be fully good at that. Describe your platform your current level. Step see. So and place it somewhere. At the line. And then describe your action plan. How you're going to go from your platform. To which one hundred percent. I will go into every step. With a bit more detail. Setting up your personal learning goals. Step. A topic. Described in one neutral sentence the topic of the cool. Start with I make it personal because it's you that works on the goal not someone else. Formulated in a positive in an active way not. What you don't want I don't want to defend myself when I get receive feedback something like that because then you know what you don't want but you're still not working towards what you do want. For an example I accept and use receive feedback. That could be a simple sentence for the goal you would like to achieve. Then describe your full hundred percent. I accept and use. Receive feedback as your. Is your topic. Your four hundred percent How would that look like. And then imagine all the aspects you could think of. What you would do or how would look like. If you're really performing this in a good way and. Combine knowledge skills and attitude aspects in that. So maybe you need more now. Alledge Do you accept and. Use receive feedback. Maybe you have to enhance your skill maybe you have a negative attitude to it's. And it could looks like something like this. I have an open attitude and proactively ask for feedback. To peers and teachers. I'm able to engage in conversations about to receive feedback to truly understand it. I respect the feedback received and I'm able to provide my opinion on this. And able to implement crucial aspects of that feedback. And I regularly monitor my developments concerning my capability to integrate. Great suit and feedback. So this will be the best way for this person to go about with accepting and using. Receive feedback. And sometimes to set up this hundred percent you need to do some research. To be able to think of elements you could put in there. Then decide what your platform is. So where are you now what is your current level. In comparison to this one hundred percent. So. Put to put a mark somewhere on this line. And describe how it looks like what you're doing now. In this case I'm open to receive feedback from supervisors. But I struggle receiving feedback from my team members. There I hardly want to ask for feedback. And I doubt the use of it especially for members that I appreciate less. I also struggle with the selecting relevant feedback. And continuously implementing feedback given. I tend to stick to my own preferred way working. So this would be the current level of a person so there's enough room for improvement. And then we go to the last ep. The action plan. We actually want to go from your platform. To your full achievement. And that's actually the most important step. What are you going to do. To get better at it and make this specific. And make this. Action oriented and. Decide when you want to work on it. Where with you maybe an example. I welcome feedback given to me. Regardless of who gives it by taking up an open attitude. Thanking the person who gives feedback and. Asking clarifying questions if. Needed for the feedback I receive about my function I select relevant aspect to implement and make. At least one. And make an. At least once every two weeks. A plan of action. To implement that feedback and. I ask a pin. The opinion of my supervisor and my peers about the quality of the actions. And continuously search for improvement throughout the period. So you can see that. Here the time aspect is covered. You know this person knows about when to do what. And that. It's actively. Written down. So it's about taking action. And with that we can go back to the reflective learning cycle. Now you know what to do to improve so you can try out. And you can look back on your trial. So what did you actually do. And what were sensual aspects now we're actually getting better at feedback what was working with it what was not. And then we could even adapt or learning or say well this aspect actually didn't work the way I thought it would work and. Adapted to it's another goal and try that out again. So repeatedly going through the reflective learning side. Cycle. Adapting along the way and hopefully. Stepping up the ladder getting better at it. So to summarize. Decide what you or any goal you're going to to take up. Something you feel motivated by. Then commit to it by really turning it into action. Working on it. Doing it and reflecting back on it. And by doing that and going through the reflective learning cycle few times. You might succeed and get better at things. So to actively improve your performance use a reflective learning cycle. And settle personal learning goals. In four steps. Good luck.\n",

                "text": "Written feedback. Feedback is key to improvement in online learning you mostly work with recent feedback. And feedback therefore is the tool. That makes online learning possible. Learning in online courses rely on peer feedback and instructive feedback almost soly therefore. It's important to give this skill your full attention. You're dependent on written feedback and online courses. There's no aural feedback. There are no nonverbal cues. And there's no direct question on supposable. So when somebody says something in a very gentle way. Or a very harsh way you cannot tell. With reason feedback. So you might not get the subtle message that somebody is bringing across. Therefore the quality of your feedback. Is extra important sometimes you need to actually even more words. Instead of less words to bring across what you're actually wanting to see. So Williams of the University of Hawaii. Said. As a peer reviewer your job is not to provide answers. You raise questions. The writer makes the choices. You act as a mirror. Showing the writer how the draft looks to you and pointing out areas which need attention. So you ask more. What do you. What you read here. Do you actually like it or not you give you could give a positive comment. Learn as you learn much faster. And you could also comment on hey this is actually not. Not clear yet. What do you mean here and that's already giving a lot of feedback. Pointing out those areas which need attention. P. feedback takes time. It takes actually a lot of time. You might just be ready with your own assignment and you're happy you're able to upload it in feedback froze. And then. You still have to give feedback to your peers. And. Well some. Somehow you think I'm done with it now I'm free because I'm done with my own job. Now. Also reserve time for feedback to others. You might learn. Just as much or even more. Or. From reading their comments seeing things from a different perspective. So the one giving feedback you learns as much as the receiver. And do not forget to take time for that. Read first. What. The whole document. Of the document you want to give feedback to. Because the structuring might be different then the structure you would you would give give it. So read fist through the whole document. And then decide this is most essential to give feedback to and this it's much easier to decide what the areas of feedback when you know. The whole document. Be clear about the type of feedback. What are you trying to get feedback about. Is it the purpose. Is it the content. Is the style format the side that beforehand. And separate those as well. Maybe you can even comment on saying this is purpose. This is content with. Looking at the argumentation and. Comment on hey here the style could be improved. So this side before hand. What are you going to get feedback about. You could also ask the receiver what would you like to get feedback about. So that makes it easier for you to look specifically at what you want to give feedback at. Mix feedback. Giving your strengths and weaknesses. People grow much faster and get more motivated. When they also know what they're doing well. So do not only point out the things that are not good. Also point out the things that really made sense to you and offer suggestions if the. If you have the but not come ons like you should be or you have to be clear like that but. Offer a suggestion or give remarks like this is not clear yet. For me. Because it's personal. Be clear and take specific. So that you appear will know what you're referring to so. With trick changes you can. You can precisely highlight. What sentence you're referring to. You can. Precisely highlight a spelling error. Etc. So. Be specific with. What you know what you give feedback to. Also read your comments before passing them on to your peer. Because once you read them again you might see that actually hey. I was not so clear yet. Avoid turning your peers paper into your paper. You have a certain style and that might be your preference but your peers a different person from a different perspective. Maybe so. Keep your eyes on your own paper. And that you can do exactly as you wanted. But try to read from the perspective of the other and give suggestions and come ons. From that perspective. Think the one that gives you feedback. Because giving feedback. Takes an effort and it takes time to do so and a person is actually helping you to get better at something. And if you have questions. You might want to ask the person also hey this is clear for me this feedback but here. That was not yet. So clear. And thank the person. For the effort. So. Summary. Feedback is the most essential tool in online learning. Giving good feedback. Takes a lot of time. The one giving feedback. Learns as much as the receiver.",

                "text": "One of the most essential things. To be able to learn effectively. Is giving and receiving feedback. With feedback from our teachers or pairs of family. I the written non-verbal of verbal you get an indication on how you perform. Why giving feedback. And why is it important. It supports. Self Assessment. Or self-awareness. Look at this cat. He looks in the mirror is an actually things have a lie and I'm very good. So imagine he would not get feedback from all his surroundings then he would keep think people on thinking that he would be a lion. So feedback is important to get a better idea about. Well who you are and how you perform. It might also be. That actually your lion. Thinking that you are a little cat. So there. It would also be nice when your. People around you would tell you hey Actually you are much bigger your much better you are much more powerful than you actually think you are so feedback and Hans is your self awareness. Feedback. Also enhances your reflection and learning skills. It demonstrates your progress or. Over time. Your performance over time and. With feedback. You starts no better hey here and there. So here and there I could improve. And I could. And by doing so you can step up the ladder of learning. Feedback. Also improves. Self-esteem for that. Because when you know you are able to perform better. You. By trying and. With the feedback of others. You start to perform better. Feedback improved your satisfaction. Because imagine that you would never get feedback Why would you do things by hearing hey actually you did great or you help me or supported me or that was very clear. We get satisfied to bow to work. And that builds your motivation. In general feedback actually build your motivation look at this test. By now you've probably tried to read this. All the way and. This test immediately gave you feedback. By being able to do so or not and therefore you probably got motivated to want to read it all. Well. In general with feedback it works the same it builds your motivation. You get better. You want to get better if you know well. Where you can. We can improve or and if you can do it well so feedback builds your motivation. Then we go to. Well so how to get feedback. And one of the most important things. With giving feedback. Is sharing your observations. Of what you see. And what you hear. So this is some here's some essential points in giving feedback first of all these observations. These are vital sharing just giving back. What you see or what you hear somebody does often already gives a lot of information for the receiver. Even more information you can give to the receiver. By also sharing your interpretation of that observation. And the effect it has on you. Make sure you always get feedback. In. I form. So you make it personal because. Feedback is something you see and it's your interpretation ends and the effect. It causes and you might be very different from the affected course in someone else so. Always give feedback. In. I form. I see. I hear. I think you do it because of this. And the effect on me is because that's a very personal thing and. So. Try to stay away from you. From you you do this or. How good in general. But keep it personal. Let's look at an example of how to separate this observation into petition. And effect. Here. The observation for example. I hear you speaking at a slow pace or. Another observation could be a saw you were late at our meetings for out of five times. Then you can have an interpretation around that behavior problems are not sent through just about the topic. So if somebody speaks low. You might interpret it as well. Maybe you're not so enthusiastic. Or maybe you did not prepare well. You need a lot of time to sink. With the person being a four out of five times you might interview is I think you very being lazy. What a lazy person or I think you are very busy. So that it's British I'm as as as a big difference also on the affected calls us. The effect. Could be I find it hard to keep focused on what you say because of the slow pace or. I find you very easy to follow. Or with the person being made to dim of demotivates me I will not put everything being in time. Next time either or. I don't mind. Understand you're very busy I'll just start without you. So all this information is very nice to hear for receiver. Because it gives a full idea of. Well what do I do. What. How do people interpret it and what is the effect. And that is what you want to know is what you do. Causing a beneficial effect or not. So when you get feedback you really help the person. By giving as much information about it as possible. Some more tips about giving receive feedback. Try to be direct. In giving feedback so I'm not beating around the bush like in this picture. But. Be a fair and honest and respectful. Don't talk. Give feedback via chippers know via someone else but. Speak to the person you want to give feedback to be aware of your personal preference. With feedback. Your pointing with your finger at someone else. Be sure that this is a subjective as possible look at the objective criteria. And try to separate it as much from. Only your personal preferences. Because these are different from person to person. Makes positive and negative feedback here you see a sandwich which is basically same. Positive Negative. Positive. And that to some. That would be a could be a way that you want to get feedback really. People let in also negative or improvement points negativity in much better if they feel safe. So also tell them what they do write often. Most of what people do. Is actually quite good and some things are there to improve. And we learn much faster. If we also know what we do well we feel more feel more comfortable when we feel more comfortable. We learn faster. So try to also give a lot of positive feedback. Be specific with your feedback. And not like. This dog with his boss. He would like to get more feedback. About what he done wrong. Then receiving feedback. If you. If you receive feedback if you get feedback you don't like it. Don't try to push it away to have tried to let it in. And thank the person giving you feedback. If you feel offended you might want to say so but also this she tried to state it in a and. In a neutral way. So and try to let it in at first light. Let let it sink in maybe you want to take a timeout or take. Take some time. And later on you want to come back to it. But try to let it in and. Ponder about it if it's true or not. But you also can do is ask others do you agree with it or. Do you not to agree with it. So you get more feedback about the same situation. Try to let it in because feedback is. You could see it as a gift. It's there to help you gain insight. Ask questions. To receive more detailed information if you get feedback that's not given very clearly. Because often people don't give you the observation intimidation effect but they just say hey that was very great. So then I ask hey what was actually so great what did I do right. Or when you can improve. Where can I improve what exactly did I do that was not very effective. Receiving feedback also. Is not that you always have to have to change what people are giving you ask others. If you. If they also saw it and decide for yourself it's. If it's important enough to change or not. So as a summary. Separating observations from interpretation and effect. Is very beneficial in giving feedback. And especially given your observation. Is key to improvement. Feedback is indispensable for effective learning. And feedback. Is a skill that you can practice and improve. Good luck with giving and receiving feedback.",

                "text": "I co-founding. It's a threat for into an awfully tittie. You can prevent confounding. By For example in a machine ation. But you can also repaired. Co-founding you need gait analysis by. For example mildew for the in your Christian analysis. And after this clip you will know how you can use this mill to ferry and lean your aggression. I notice. And I'm killing tooling the principle of confounding sort of. Trying or. To describe all of analysis. So be sure to cue and stand. The principle of confounding before you continue watching this clip. So as to post. We want to study the. Association between sex and blood pressure cross-sectional. Blood pressure will be included as a continues for able. And the search we are able to use a linear regression model. And I hope you are familiar with read it. Then your question more ruling. So we have to dependent variable blood pressure. Yet the intercept so did verify the immigration line crosses the. The Y. X. and. We have a one sort it is to intercept this how does the slope of the Christian line. And we have the independent variable. And in this example that has sex. So it is also cool to university at a linear regression model because we only include one. In the tenth variable. In the model. So it is how the crowd of looks like. We have D Y axes. With blood pressure. And only actually have sex. So here we did. The mean blood pressure in maim and men are depicted and. You can see men. Appear to have a higher blood pressure. Then we men. So when you draw a regression line. Then. This. Bieda regression line. So how do you know how you calculate this quote of his regression line. So I hope that you don't remember Dad the slope. Is just calculated by dividing the change in blood pressure by to change sex in this example. The change in X. is just one because we assign is dated two women and. I want two men then when you subscribe to fill you just want to change and why is the difference. In blood pressures between men and women. So when you divide it by one. You still. You still have the mean difference. So disloyal. Is nothing more then a crude. Blood pressure. Difference between men and women. So I am explaining this crude as you're shaking because you need to understand that before you can understand how you can use. Milk you very good learn your question. To adjust for confounding. So be aware that a regression water. Only describe the data. So it does not represent. Per se. The truth. So is it what you make that. It's the slope is just the crude. Blood pressure difference. So now we look at the model itself so how can you calculate the blood pressure in men. Using this model and. As you can see over here. The blood pressure in men is just the. Intercept plus the slope. And then you calculate the blood pressure in women. It is just the. Intercept as you can also see over years ago here the line closest to the Y. axis. So when you subscribe to these. These models because you want to know the difference between men and women. Then you end up with the intercept. Because when you subtract a zero from a zero then is just zero. And then use a strict. From the use of strength to zero from a want. It's just a one. So death that fits with each other so that means that they want really to crude. Up every difference between men and women. So suppose. We think that age is a confounding initiation we know from literature. That blood pressure tends to increase with age. Furthermore we know dad's age. Is not a consequence of sex so do you still hear Tyria. Our answer tweet. Yes. But what about the second criteria. So that's what we want. Would like to study in our own study population. Or actually want to study it in our fourth population but of course we can do that. We start with studying these issues Jason in our own study population. And it appears that men are ten years old wooden women. So. Also the second strike to be at is fulfilled so Daire for H.. Is a life You Tube you can founder. So to question is. Is the crude. Blood pressure difference is it just due to sex. Or is it due to age or two boats. At least when you look at the triangle you would conclude that it's. It's not only due to sex because AIDS. Appear to be a confounder so. Part of the effect of a wound is attributable to the effect of H.. Own blood pressure. But how much we do not know and therefore we would like to use a milter very linear Creston analysis. So death means that you include the potential confounder. As independent. In your model. So. So it's not longer want independence for a while but you should therefore we cool this mill deferred. In your aggression analysis. So again we have depended for our blood pressure we have the intercept. We have the slope. However be you be aware did this. Slope is the age or just a sex difference a blood pressure and B two is the slope of Blood pressure on H. I mean I know that you. Be a positive. Because we know that from literature. So again we have to use this craft and how about a little differently in your breast analysis. When you include. Eight. So actually about adults. Is just studying gushy asymmetry in fact some blood pressure. In many many many. Age groups. So debt's re presented with did the queen. Aligned over here. So and. If you threat to fly then. The confounded does not for you read in the straight out self. And a search. It's not a confounder. In that specific strata. So as we know. Dead men. Have a higher blood pressure and also. All the or. It is more the association between sex and blood brain the higher. Age groups and year. This is the lower age groups. So how do you take an average of these. Gresham line. So deaths. That's through there to adjust its model. So it just is a kind of. Average of all these separate lines and. The slope of the association. Is just. Aged just as blood pressure difference in men and between men and women. So did means that. This is due to a fact. The Through difference in blood pressure but. The men of Mammon. So when you compare it with the crude. You see. Dat. The slope is much steeper. When you have the crude analysis. So it's. The case in this situation. And the the myth. Men and being men and women. And the men and women blood pressure. Difference is confounded by age. So can you also use this model to calculate the blood pressure. In men and women separately you can. So first of all would like to draw your attention to the university at analysis or without including age. Just as a refresher. So you know death in blood pressure men it's just the. Intercept a zero plus the slope and. In women. Is just the. Intercept a zero. Because we assign a zero to women. So you use this a regression analysis to calculate the proper show you men. And therefore you do you add the intercept of this line. Plus the. I just did a blood pressure. Their friends and D. D. if the B. to show the effect of age. On blood pressure in men is or should be demeaned age and. That's the same you you feel out. The model also you can also feel I would be more dough to obtain a blood pressure in women. And therefore you. As you can see. B. You won does not contribute to the proper show in women. So to summarize decompression between the crude model and the MIL deferred model I am. Have in this slides. So you have to crest. The pressure model first of all we had to. Crude model. So the independent for able the. Intercept the slope. When you want to describe the stock specific data. This. Are to mortals. So in women only the intercept contribute. Three percent the blood pressure on women and to calculate the blood pressure men. You have to add in the step plus the slope of this. So when you want to calculate a different. President men and women then you subtract these two models from each other and. It appears that a one. Three percent to the crew difference but. In blood pressure between men and women. The second Mortal we looked at will be no to Faria it's a mortal. And in that mortal we. And it's sex. Of the edit. Age. Because there was a confounder initiation. And I hope did. You and you know by now death be one is the true difference in blood pressure. Due to sext. When you want to describe. Used this model to describe the sex specific data. You are doing it as follows. You have you feel in this model and you use the mean age to suppose you mean age in in men is fifty. And the mean age. In women is forty. You used it in you formalized. And then used to obstruct the smaller from each other it appears that the blood. The the difference of blood pressure men and band. Men and women. Is represented by would be one. Close be to multiply by ten. So what does it mean for example when Beach is Ciro if the two is zero. It means that there is no issue she. Between age and blood pressure. And a shortage the first part is not fulfilled. And if that is Ciro this part of the model. Does most contribute to different. And therefore a one just three percent. Be Won so. This is not confounded any more so if B. to you. So if there is no is your station between eight and blood pressure to be two would be about. And therefore. It does mean that a one is not. Confound it. If there were no and mean no age difference between men and women it means that ten will be zero. So what does that mean. It's means that it's second criteria so initiation between your exposure and your cool fonder is not fulfilled. Any more. So again this part of your model. Does not call into beauty to D. mean difference. And therefore is not. Confounded. And this re percents it's true a fact. So due to differences between men and women. So in a triangle. It's actually explaining the same thing. We have to just add more also be one show just a true difference in blood pressure between men and women and. We have do crude models sort of a one. And in this a one the effect of age and sex are not all this and tangles. But if you use you build a first analysis. Then you are disentangle these effects of age and sex speak. Kills you you have the the. The difference or just a difference in blood pressure. And that is in the benefit of age. And these effect of age is its. Is represented by. This part. So. As I explained to previous like this. Ten is related to deceptions. Cartier Yeah. And this beach hue is represented. To the first criteria. So what I explain to the grapes. Is that you can of prayer. Founding by mildew for your date analysis and such analysis. You disentangle the effect of to confound it. And the exposure on the call. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "High school funding is a trap for the. Into inability. And you want to have an effect measured that there's no bias of. Biased. Of course. You can remove confounding. By stood to fight another says. And I'm killing to explain in this clip. How you can do that by to to fight analysis. So when you start your analysis you first of all do your crude analysis so you study yesterday. You knew you were told the population. However if you think there is it will found a press or present you can also start the fire analysis and. That means that you study U. S. or Chez sion. By your confounder. So for example if you think that smoking is a co-founder you can study you as you. Never smoke is by foremost smokers. And by current smokers. So actually death. Is not thing more then just a trick your in your own data. So you. You use. So the fight analysis. Because then the confounded does not fairy. With in this trad to use. So I am going to explain a third a weed an example. So does is a follow up fifteen years. And you were in this population. Is the Amsterdam civilians of are sort of and. You want to study to be hypertension. And more tell it. So in you want to know. Age is a founder in this issue. Going to start the fight and not of this. So first of all you started the association in your total population. So in old age groups. So you have the. The number of deaths in a person's death the hypertensive. And the number of deaths in a person that are not hypertensive. So your. Measure of Asian. Is in this exam. Incidents reports and raids. So do you remember how to go play that. I hope so first of all you're calculating your incidence proportion you're hypertensive participants. So it's the finding the number of deaths. By the total number in that group. And you also get instant proportion in your normal hypertensive. So defining the number of deaths by the total number. In this moment I pretended scoop. The instant the portion rate is calculated by dividing these two numbers by each other. So as you can see the crude incident reported it is one point eight So that means that persons with hypertension. Have more risk to die. So what are you killing to do next when you want to know where the AIDS to confound your association. So you're going to stratify analysis. So actually you are just tricked you up. A confounded two fer you eat in the strata. So weary you have this for. Age groups. And you study to specific as to Shay Sion in each of these for. Age groups. And you can see the incident proportion rates in each of these groups. So as you can see these incidents proportion. Rates are reasonably. Him with genius. In just shot off. H.. So now you have. For instance the portion rates be how are you killing to compared it to crude want to actually you want an average of D.S.. Before into the proportion rates and of course you know how you can calculate an average Joe just adding these two Kadar and dividing by four. However. It's better to use the mental handle approach. And in do use this approach. Then the. Adjusted estimate so you are just a fact measure. Is. Also adjusted for the size of each traitor. So let's play net so it may seem quite complicated but it isn't. So you have the ideas that instant proportion wait. And what you are killing to do is just. The incident proportion hypertensive to two the divided by forty three. The why did it again by the total number. In this age group. So this is. The first. Age group is the second is the third. In this fort. And you. If you defied the. Instant proportions. By the total number. In each group. So as you can see the number of participants in the last. Age group so that are those who are fifty five years and. All there is the highest. And that means that this incident proportion rate. Contribute to D. and average. Incident proportion weight. So does the adjusted incident proportion rate. And do you remember the cruet. Is a proportion rate. So that those one point eight. And if you compared these numbers. You can conclude that there. There is a difference between these two. So you. You see to try angle to here you see the incident proportions are just that and a crude one. And you can see that a crude. Association is biased. Upwards because but. Dispense with a high blood pressure. So hypertensive participants are all there in a search. Your crude. Association does not represent only the between hypertension and blood pressure and mortality. Birds. Also reflected as she asymmetry in age and mortality. So deaf or. Do you shoot straight the fire you know you can stratify your analysis. Calculated the average instant proportion raid using the mental health. Hensel approach. And it shows. Search. Kimo pretty. Incidental portion rate that reflect as you share. Between hypertension and mortality. Independent of the fact of age. So when do you conclude that there is some difference between these two days between the crude and just an instant proportional rate or any order. Or other. Relative risk. So a rule of. Found is that if it's about ten percent different. Then there is probably confounding. So deaths just a rooftop. So in this clip. I told you how you can use rectified. Analysis to groom the pair confounding. Your data analysis. Thank you for your attention.",

As much as possible. You can prevent confounding bias. And after this clip. You will know why. So suppose you are interested in. Alcohol intake. And risk of Type two diabetes. Smoking is a co-founder it's. Educated drinking alcohol. It's a risk factor for type two diabetes. And it is not a consequence of. Drinking alcohol. So it via your what do you think. If you include only smokers you study. If smoking still co-founder. Think about the triangle. Smoking is no blower. Officiated with drinking alcohol because you only smoke when you study. Because you have only disc. Also. Smoking is not so long were educated with risk of Type two diabetes. In your study population. So I search. There is no bias. Due to go founding so strict in is a way to do it because it prohibits. Your potential confounder to vary. So in Stuart. It provides a fiction prevents confounding. Because it prohibits.

                "text": "And in case of heating a fluids. The heat transfer can be very fast in case both the heating medium and heated product. Are well mixed. For solid foods. Or for food and blankets. The heating profile is very different. And there's no escape. I will discuss the heat transfer. In solid foods. So let's get a certain size of solace in effect. Have to be heated for some time to allow the heat. To penetrate to the inside this key metric graph. Gives the temperature profile. As a function of the time assume an outside temperature of the heating medium. And an initial inside temperature of the product. But ongoing time. The product is also heated in the center. And in the end. The product reaches the dark a temperature. Which is the outside temperature. So there is a slow heating inside. Solid process you can think of meat vegetables and cancer. That have to be heated from the outside. The Heat transfer is quantified to its various core fissions. Here you can distinguish. Heaters for. By conduction true a solid wall. Or to assert in a solid medium. Here we have the conduct of heat transfer. Coefficient which is the right from the conduct of fifty and. The distance over which the heat has to be transferred. In case of convection. So we talk about a fluid medium that. Bill and Holmes. He transfer. We have to take into account. The properties of the flow. And that is done with the right notes number. It describes the flow properties. And we have the fluid properties. And these are combined in the. On the number. The two are combined again. In another number. And then we notice Nussle number. We can derive the convective. Heat transfer. Coefficients. This is the case for. Heat transfer from a medium. To arts. An object. But also from an A for instance and he did well in sight. Of liquid product. Knowing these we can derive the overall heat transfer coefficient. So we talk about two. Convective heat transfer core fissions outside the product and. Inside think is really good as well. And the. Conduction over the wall. He transfer. Is enhanced by a driving force. Which is that then but your difference. But due to resistance to heating was a limitation to the rate of heat transfer. Regarding the heat transfer. To and in the cellar product we did we can distinguish. He transfer from the medium. To the product. So the outside and hear the confection is limiting. So it's this part of the graph. The consequent heat transfer. In the product. Is limited by the conduction. Which is often the case. In a solid product. The two resistances. Are combined. In a new number. The bio number. This bio number. Gives the balance between the inside. Internal conductive resistance. Over the external convective resistance. In this relation. You see the conductive part the convective. Part. And combined. We see. Externally. Convective heat transfer coefficient. The smallest. I mention of the product. The internal heat conduct of fifty. For the calculations. Of the heating time or temperature. They have to distinguish three different. Archetypal forms of products. The dark about the cylinder. A slip or a sphere or four. Products that deviate a little bit. We can combine them. So we can. Effect calculated for all types of objects. So think of a tin or a pouch. Can be derived. Knowing these are the data of these forms. And another know this clip. On indirect heat exchange. In a vel makes product. It was derived. How fast a product. Is heated. And this relation. Is given here. What we see here. Is the external temperature. The heating medium. C two times the initial. Product temperature and product temperature. After a certain time. We have the different. The overall. The heat transfer coefficient. The area of the volume. And we have a time of heating. So knowing all these. Better meters. And knowing the time. Can the rife. But then picture or the other way around. Every no temperature that you want that you want to achieve. We can derive the time that we need to heat the product. This relation. Cannot be rewritten by introducing the typical for. The typical dimension of the products. Here we had the area. Over the volume. Well dear H.-A. Area overfull you can be transformed. To the square diaries or over go to distort. Power. Felt this part. Can be. Really written. Furder. And this will be the result. What we see here is in fact three parts. We see this part. That's the B O number. It's given there. This part is the heat a few seventy. So it's there going to to fifty over the density and the heat capacity. Realized at the. OK. Given here is often given in literature. But it is in fact. The conductivity. But this heat if you seventy. Is a measure of the rate of conduct of heat transfer. In the product. Combining the he diffusive to even the temperature and the dip typical dimension. We have a new number. Which is to free a number which is in effect a dimensionless form of time. So we can say. The temperature part. Is a function of the bio number and for a number. And now for any bio number. We can infect the Rife temperature in a product. After a certain time or. The time to reach a certain temperature. In order to make these calculations. We have to use. Heisler charge. So we can calculate the temperature in the product or the time that we need both. In order to do so. We have to know the DIA geometry. The outside temperature. He diffusive fifty. In a product. The heat transfer go fish and. The density. And the conduct of fifty. Well here you see a typical high slit charge for. A fear in this case. And what this graph I will explain a little bit a little bit more. How to use this. What we see here is different girths. And they give the one. Over by zero number. If the resistance is outside the product so in the convective. Part. We can say that the bio number is free. Low. And the one over by zero is for a high. So we are in this part of the curve. In case we have. Most resistance. In in the product inside product. B.-O. is high. But the one over be zero is low so we are more at the left part. And this left part. Is magnified in this. Separate graph. A What else do we see in this graph. We see. The four year number. And we see the typical temperatures. At the Y. axis. Well how to use these. Oh first. Have to realize that we have different charts for the different geometries. So it's fear. A slip or a cylinder. But they work in the same way. Here is an example of how to calculate a temperature. After a certain time. But all these data. We can calculate the bio number. And we know. One over by zero. So we know which course to use. In this case. Be asked the temperature. After twenty five minutes. So we know that the time. Time is given twenty five minutes. Knowing the time it allows us to use the four. To calculate to free a number. So we know which girth. Well. Summer here. We are. We know. The typical course we have to use the biochar for and we can go to the left. To be rife. Temperature part of this formula. Well we know the external temp to your initial tempter. So we can calculate the temperature. After twenty five minutes. In this case. Seventy five degrees. The other way around. You can also do it at. Question is now what will be the temperature. After. Now what. Yeah. When will the temperature be eighty degrees. So in that case. We know. The left part. We know where we are at the Y. axis. We still new bio number. And now we can derive to free a number. So going back. We can see that. We did arrive to free a number. And knowing to free a number. We can see that it takes thirty minutes. To bring the temperature. To eighty degrees. With an external. Temperature of hundred and an initial temperature of four degrees. Regarding these stun mentions it should be. They should take into account. How the product is heated. For instance heating. Of meat. You can heat from one side or from more sides. In case it's two sided heating. This typical dimension is only half the thickness. And for a sphere or a cylinder. The typical dimension is in fact. The radius. Because the product is heated from all sides. For objects that deviate a little bit from fear slip or cylinder. We have to combine to form enough. Of in this case a cylinder and a slip. This is the situation for. Again. We can see this as a cylinder. It's certain size or. Quite a thick slap. First you have to determine the free number for the one dimension. Then we have to drive to free a number for the second dimension and. To derive that. The temperature part. You have to multiply the two. Here is given in an example. I will not. The sculls discuss all the numbers. But the cylinder. It's given here and. We find the temperature part. Open fifty eight. And for the snap open ninety five. And by multiplying the two. We can again be rife. The temperature. Similar situation for a brick type. Product. Now we have in fact three dimensions. So the length of it. And the height. So in effect we do the same calculation. But now. Three times. In case of a a loss my own number which. We often have indicates of heating solid foods. We can derive that case we increase the. I mentioned that effect to the time to bring it that a certain temperature is four times higher. We can derive that from the. Free a number. If the four year number. It is. Well for a low. Or hero. In fact the risk of poor heating. Well if the. Time is short. To also be of a low for a number. So we are still at the outside of the product the heat is not really and. In the product. But once the number it's quite large. The product will be fully heated. You can also see this in the. Die a meter. A small diameter. Have a larger for ya number and. The heating. The fool he think. Will have happened. Faster. So in the heat transfer of solids the B.-O. number is free important. Case of a small. Bio number. You can say that the hull outside. Heating is a limiting factor. And we can improve the heating. By changing the process. In case the dimension is twice as large the. Time to heat the product is also a duplicate and. In case you have a large bio number. Which is the case for many. Solid foods. The insight. Heating is the limiting factor. We can improve the heating rate by changing the temperature. Sorry the product that mentions. In case that the mention is twice as large. The time. Will be four times longer now. Or better in the other way around. If we decrease the size of the product. The full heating will take shorter time.",

                "text": "In food processing and preparation. The often of heating and cooling steps. So we bring in heat. Upon heating. And we extract heat. Upon cooling. The rate of heating. The amount of heat that we need any effective. Effectivity of the heating. Depends on the thermal properties of food. So in this knowledge clip. I will discuss the Turmel properties. Of food. I will explain. The entropy. The heat. Specific heat capacity. The thermal conductivity and the Turmel diffusive A-T.. First the end will be because C. the end will be. As the energy of a material. Or a product. Upon heating or cooling. We et orbi extract and so this result in an end will be changed. For systems that have constant pressure. The end will be changes equal to the amount of heat that is added or removed. Regardless of what happens inside the system. Of course upon heating something they'll change. This can be either a change in temperature or a change in a face or to vote. We can distinguish two types of heat. We talk about. Sensible heat. And let and heat. A product that increases in temperature. Has gained sensible heat. It is the heat. That we can feel. A product that has undergone a face change the face transition. So friends is from water. To vapor. From ice. To Water has gained. Let and heat. It is the heat you're going to feel the temp or the temperature is unchanged. So we just don't feel a difference. We just see the difference. For the sensible heat. It's given as good as your particular gram. For. Degree. Kelvin or are centigrade. Whereas for LET. Indeed there is no. Temperature change so. The unit disk usual. Per kilogram. Let's look at this figure. For explaining a bit further. The sensible heat and the length and heat. A few We start with ice. At zero degrees. Upon melting of this. Ice. We can say. We have an. Let and heat step. There is no. Temperature increase. Both the ice. And the water. Will have will be for us here a degree centigrade. So there's only a face change. The heat that this required to melt the ice. Is three hundred thirty four killer Szell per kilogram. It's called LET and heat. In the next step. Upon heating. This water of zero degree centigrade. Up to its boiling point. So hundred degrees we have to bring in a certain amount. Depending on the amount of water again. And this is called sensible heat research. A temperature change. And now the amount of heat that this Rick writes. To increase the temperature is four hundred nineteen. Killer sial particular from. It is boiling point. Three strands from ation. From water. At hundred degrees. To Faber of hundred degrees. So there we have a lot and he'd step again. If a procession. And this requires a lot of energy. More than two thousand per kilogram. But also the other way around you can say. Going back from Steam. Favor of hundred degrees. Back to water. Of hundred degrees this delivers a lot of energy. The steam tables. Tell us the values of the sensible heat. And let. Heat of vaporization a different pressures. And together they give the total entropy of the material. In this case steam. So for water. You have the sensible heat. The liquids and will be. You can say. It's four hundred nineteen. Give us your particular gram. The lead and heat. Or the end will be of evaporation or representation is the. Two hundred two thousand two hundred kilos you'll particular gram and together. It's that those will and will be. Of the steam boat. Let and heat and sensible heat are pressured dependent. The higher the pressure. In this direction. The higher the boiling point. The higher. The sensible heat. But the lower. The end will be of use operation. So in total the entropy of the set you rate the steam. The different pressures. Does not change that much. In principle you can see a process in which. If a process in which no and will be is lost. Dental P.. That is coming in but also come out. What incoming. Arda. The flows. France is a product. And a heating medium. In the process. There will be heat transfer. And what's coming out hasn't totalled the same amount of and will be. There is a transfer of energy however. From in most cases. The upon heating. The heating medium. To watch the product. So the individual flows. Will have a different. And will be. But the total entropy is unchanged. And example. Is a steam heater. Here we bring in cold water. But you want to increase in temperature and we use steam. To increase this temperature of the water. So the cold water and the steam are the incoming flows. Both. The steam will compensate. And a hot water. Of the water will take up this energy. And will become hot water and the steam. Both show up as scum and saith. So the total entropy of the cold water and the steam. Is equal to the total it will be of the hot water and the going inside then the specific heat capacity. It's also given as. Just heat capacity or specific heat. It gives the amount of heat. That should be added to raise the temperature of one kilogram of material with one degree centigrade. It depends on the composition of the food water has a very high heat capacity. Looking at the different components of a product. We can see that. Well water has. Heat capacity of. Four point eight hundred years you'll procure from the degree. Whereas for Fed protein it's a lot lower. All we can determine heat capacity. But the formula. Where we increase. Where we include the must fraction of the components. And the individual heat capacities. Of these different components. So a product. With a lot of water. Will require quite some energy to heat it. Another property. Is the thermal conductivity. This determines the rate of heat transfer. Become talk about heat from heat. Conduct to fifty. Through a wall. For instance in an indirect heating system. Or heat conductivity. In a solid food. The total heat flow through a conducting wall or a food product. Depends on the driving force and the resistance to heat flow. But the driving force is the temperature difference. And the resistance depends on the the. The distance that the heat has to travel. And on the property of the material. Well total heat. That will be transferred. Depends on. Well is proportional to the temperature difference. The heat exchange. Area. But that's it refers proportional to the thickness of the layer. While the proportionality constant is called the conduct of fifty. So the units off to a con the devotee. Is then she will for meter for second. Kelvin or. Combined it's what per meter for Kelvin or per degree centigrade that's the same. Then the heat. If you're fifty and the other property. It gives the ability of a material to conductor more energy. Relative to its ability to store. Turmoil and. So it has to conduct a fifty. And it has the heat capacity. And we have the density in between the units for he diffuse if he is. Square meters per second. This makes me do the summary of the thermal properties of food. We can see the end will be. As a total energy content. Regarding heat. We can distinguish sensible heat and light and heat and the important property. Properties. Thermal properties of food are to. Specific heat capacity to heat conduct to fifty. And the diffuse seventy.",

                "text": "There are many methods. To heat a food product. Quite some foods are heated and cooled. In an indirect way. And this knowledge clip. I will discuss the heat transfer. By indirect heating. The methods. And the efficiency. The most common way to eat food. Is by. Indirect heating. Which is heating. Through a wall. There is no contact between. The heating medium. And the product. They think can be done in a batch mode. Or in a continuous mode. Here is surely examples of the bet's mult. And he continues mold. In case of. But heating you can think of heating in a bent or heating in a vessel. You have a certain amount of product in case of heating. In a vessel. We often have a double jacket he first saw the tank. Where we have the heating medium. Inside the jacket. Besides. Rich an educator to promote convective hatred for further into the product. For the continuous remote we can distinguish crosscurrent. Go current and. Counter current approach. Here you see is the examples of the. Different modes of the continuous heat exchange. We have to cross current the Coker and. And the counter current in the case of crosscurrent. We have. For instance. Steam. At the one side of the heating medium and. The product at the other side. That's the case for all these these three. Situations. But in case of cross current the temperature of the heating medium. Remains the Same. For instance when steam is commentating this creates a constant temperature. The product is flowing in a certain direction. And when we look at the temperature profiles. We see. The constant temperature for the. Steam. In this case for the wall. And we see the increasing temperature of the product. And a Coke or in situation we have the flow of the heating medium. And the flow of the pro. Product in the same direction. And we look at that temperature profile. The incoming heating medium. Is it initially. Has a high temperature. And we start with cold product. And they come together in the end. And they have the same temperature. So this can be applied for heat sensitive products. In the come to current mode. The two flows go in the opposite direction. This is the most efficient way of heating. Because in this ship this mode. We have a stable and constant temperature difference between. The heating medium. And the product. Here are some examples of continuous heat exchangers. We have a plate system where we have plates. Bits on one side. We have the product. Flowing through on the other side we have the heating medium. And this is going on and on. This way. There is a very large heat exchange area created and it can be a lot of heat transfer. However it only works for products with a low viscosity. For products with higher viscosity. We have to go to Cuba or system or a tube and shell system. Or for very high viscosities. We need to scrape surface. Heat exchanger where the product is continuously. Clean from the wall. And this can also be used to create. Forensic crystallizing or solidifying. Product. Well. Regarding the heating and cooling. We would like to know how long does it take to heat a product or to cool a product or. What is the temperature of my product. After a certain time of heating or in case of designing. Equipment. You want to know. What does that require its heat exchange. Era. Area. To achieve a certain temperature. Within a certain time of heating. To find out. We should know bit more about the barrel meters of the heating medium and. The product to be heated. Here we have the heating medium. We have a wall. And we have the product. For the heating medium. The following paramita shower important. The temperature of the heating medium. The initial product. Then pure because that gives the driving force for heat transfer that the difference in temperature between the heating medium and the product. We have to heat transfer. Coefficient. And heat transfer area together. This gives the amount of heat. That is delivered by the heating medium. Then we have a wall. Which has a certain connectivity. And a certain thickness. And knowing the conduct of the. And the thickness. We can relate. The overall. Heat transfer. Course percent. Then to product which takes up the heat has a certain mosque has a certain heat capacity. And initial. Temperature. And a dark a temperature the amount of heat. That the steak not by the product is given in this relation. And case of continuous heat exchange. It's a little bit different because we cannot use the mouse. But we should talk about the most flow. And in that case also the temperatures. The changing temperature. Both of the product. And the heating medium. Are important. But let's look at its. Is for a better situation. In an indirect. But. Heating. We can say that all the heat that this. Delivered by the heating medium. Is taken up by the product. So we can equalize the two. This gifts. Well we can resolve all these formula. A little bit. And this gives a final. Formula where we have. The temperature of the surface. At the site of the heating medium. It's at both in the upper and lower part. We have the temperature of the product. After a certain amount of. Of after a certain time. Of heating. And we have the initial. Temperature of the product. Then we have the factor with the different. Paramita of. Heat transfer core fish and the area of the density and the volume. Which forms to get at the most and heat capacity. Well these different. Paramita are often combined. In a value B.. And this B. is in fact a measure of how fast the heating takes place. Depending on what we know. And what we do not know. We can calculate the temperature. After a certain time or. The time that we need to. Needs that we need to reach a certain temperature or. The area that we need to heat a product within a certain time. A similar. Calculation a formula. Is can be made for the continuous heat shit heat exchange. Here we have the heating medium. With an initial temperature. Fell in this case for cross current this. Temperature of the heating medium is constant so. At point zero It's the same as. At later on. And we have the product. Flowing from the left to the right. With an initial temperature. And a dark a temperature. So the temperature of the heating medium is constant. Now the formula. Looks more or less the same. The only thing is that we have a Maslow. And not a mass. In this case. Then for the Coker and heat exchange. It's again. More or less similar. Here see that. The flow of the product. And the flow of the heating medium. Is in the same direction. Well again we have a similar formula. But now. It has the most flow. And it has an overall heat capacity in overall most flow. And we can derive the overall Maslow in the overall heat capacity from the most flow of the cold. Site. So the product and all of the hot side. So the heating medium. A similar situation again. For the counter current heat exchange. Now the product is going. In one direction. And the heating medium is in the other direction. Again a similar formula. Again with these. Overall. Maslow and the overall heat. Capacity. And in case these two are the same. We can make it a little bit simpler. And we can have just one. Maslow and one heat capacity. So for all the situations. We can calculate the temperature we can calculate the time. Or we can get laid the heat transfer area that we need. So an indirect. Heating and Cooling. We have two modes of. Heat exchange can have the bet's mode. Or we can have the continuous mode for making some calculations on the required. Area. Temperature or a time. We need to know. Some paramita from the heating medium. And we need to know. Some paramita. Of the product. Well once we know these. We can calculate the temperature. After a certain time of heating. Are we can calculate the time that we need to reach a certain temperature. Or we can calculate the area that we need to reach a certain temperature. Within a certain time.",

                "text": "My name is young From come. And I'm in the laboratory for the pathology. In this clip. I will discuss. The plan defense toolbox. Plans are under constant attack by different organisms. And in order to survive them a sense the attackers and they must respond to it. So they must be able to know that. An attacker is nearby. And recognize it. By some kind of sensor. They must then make a signal that they. Process and transmit. To raise the alarm. And to then synthesize. Different defense products. That effectively counteract the invasion. Or interfere with the reproduction of the attacker. It is very important to realize that plants have a very strong defense machinery. That consists of two different components. They have preform physical and chemical barriers. Comprising the plant surface. That has cuticle and wax layers. There are cell walls and vascular tissue composed of different polymers. And there are metabolites that are toxic for attackers. Also plants can induce defense mechanisms in response to an attack. They can reinforce cell walls or produce novel toxic. Metabolites. They can produce. All kinds of. Enzymes with anti microbial activity. And also. They can trigger a host cell death by a so called hyper sensitive response. And this is often accumulated by an oxidative burst. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Some examples of defense machinery components. Are given in this slide as preform defense components. There are physical barriers. Such as the cuticle and cell walls. And there are fighter and disciplines. Anti microbial metabolites. And in the picture on the right hand side. You see the compound of Venus in which is produced in a single cell layer in all truths and which has very strong anti microbial activity. Also plants can produce volatiles. That smell bad and chase away insects. As exam. Of in use defense responses. Plans can produce. Inhibitors. Of insect routine basis. That make the digestion. Difficult. And in that way service an antecedent to insects. Also there are fight to elections. And the microbial metabolites. That are produced in the. Response to the attack. At the site of invasion. That can be sellable reinforcement. By kilos and lignin. And there can be pathogenesis related proteins. With hydrologic enzyme. And some activity. Against kiting. And Lucan. Components of fungal cell walls or lysozyme a component that tacks a component of bacterial cell walls. Also plants can form double standard R.N.A. is that act in R.N.A. interference in a defense mechanism. Against viruses. Here's an example of the cell wall reinforcement. By the formation of a popular. At the top of the image you see a fungal upper story and. That is trying to invade. A plant cell wall. Through an infection peg. And underneath the cell wall. The plant is producing a popular. Composed of colors of glucose polymer. And the popular actually tries to plaster. The cell wall. And keep the infection. Out outside the plant. And sometimes this is effective. And sometimes it isn't a common theme. In many defense mechanism. Mechanisms is the induction of local cell death. It results from a hyper sensitive response that is caused by the recognition of the attacker. And this is mediated by. The interaction of a. Resistant protein. Of a plant. And in effect the molecule. Of the attacker. And the hyper sensitive response activates all kinds of. Downstream defense responses. In the image on the right hand side. You see I percentage of response to fight off her insistence in epidermal cells of potato leaves. And the hyper sensitive response. Is often accompanied with an oxidative burst. Which is the very rapid. Local accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Which is a collective name for three types of molecules. Hydrogen peroxide. Super oxide and hydroxyl radical. And that is illustrated in the next slide. Where the oxidative burst. Is indeed. Formed of these three molecules. The super oxide and ion. Indicated here in the red circle otu minus radical. It's a very toxic molecule and it's extremely reactive. Hydrogen peroxide. Is not so reactive. But is very highly water soluble. And it is actually membrane permeable. And it may serve as a signal molecule. To neighboring cells. Finally the hydroxyl radical. Is a highly reactive molecule that destroys liquids and proteins and D.N.A.. And these three molecules. Can be synthesized both chemically. And enzymatic Lee. At the interface. Of the plant. With the attacker. Reactive oxygen species actually have an ambivalent role. On the one hand they cause cellular damage. And on the other hand. They are important. In defense signaling. So on this image. You see a pathogen. Invading a plant cell wall. And it is sick creating molecules. And these molecules are recognized by a plant and. They cause. A production of super oxide and hydrogen peroxide. And these molecules will be toxic to the pathogen. And they will start to attack it. And try to counteract it. But at the same time. Hygiene peroxide. Is a substrate for enzymes that are involved in leaking if occasion. And the cross-linking of souls. And hydrogen peroxide serves as a signal to neighboring cells. For the induction of defense responses. So this creates a difficult situation. Which is very dynamic. And very complex. Understand. In defense responses it is also important to be aware of local responses versus systemic responses. And local. Responses. Are obviously only effective in restricted area. Usually around the site of the invasion of the attack on the other hand systemic responses are effective throughout the plant. Even in tissues where the attacker is not present. It is obvious that the build up of systemic resistance. Requires a signal to be produced and transmitted. And it may require a little bit of time. To be fully effective. Systemic resistance responses. Involve the signaling processes of hormones and especially cell of silica said. Just Monica acid and ethylene. Have been studied in this context. In the next slide. We illustrate three different types of systemic resistance responses. On the left here is a process of systemic. Acquired resistance which is. Induced in vegetative tissue. And also effective in vegetative tissue. And it is triggered often by a hyper sensitive response. The middle panel shows induced systemic resistance. Which is induced in Roots. By the presence of the bacteria often. And it is effective in green tissue. Above ground. And the third response on the right. Is the wound response where. Damage induced by insect feeding. Or nematodes feeding. Triggers a response to this wounding effect. And all these three responses require fight or hormone production. And signaling. The take home message for the subject. Is that the plan defense machinery. Is both. Pre-formed. And induced. And that. Defense compounds. Can either be targeting. Multiple types of attackers. Or they can be focused on a single type of attack or a common theme. Is the local cell that induction following a hyper sensitive response. And the accompanying. Oxidative burst. Including. The production of reactive oxygen species. And there are differences between local and systemic. Resistance responses. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Welcome to the course of plant pathology and disease epidemiology. My name is young from Conn. I'm in the laboratory for the pathology. And I will give you an introduction to this course. It is obvious that plants are sessile organisms. Once they have established somewhere. They cannot run away. And they must make it there. And then. Because of the photosynthetic capacity. Plants are loaded with carbohydrates. That serve as a food source for many organisms. And for these reasons plants are in the constant attack by other organisms. And they must be able to defend themselves. Effectively. In this course we will focus on the interactions between plants and attackers. And on the quantitative impacts on our crop existence. We will not focus on symptoms or on the. Morphology of attackers. Or the classification and identification of attack us. Attackers come in different size ranges from very small to very large. There are viruses in the nanometer range. Microbes in the micro meter range animals in the millimeter range. And plants. That can grow from centimeters up to meters in size. And all these attackers want to grow. On plants including our crops. We can study the interactions of plants and their attackers at different levels of integrations. From very low to very high. At the level of molecules or cells. Organs or tissues. Individual plants. Populations or on whole ecosystems. And in the first part of this course which will last three and a half weeks. We will study at the lowest levels of integration from molecule to individual plants. And in the second part of the course which will last about a week and a half. We will study it at the higher integration levels. From individual plants to hold ecosystems. In the first part of the course. We will look at the physiological mechanisms. And the interactions at the molecular and cellular level. I will discuss. The defense tools that plants have available. To counteract attackers. We will see that the plan to schoo acts as a battleground. And we will discuss how attackers attempt to invade plants. The strategies and mechanisms used in the battle by both partners are discussed. And we will see how plants can distinguish friends from enemies. India and we want to know what determines the outcome of an interaction. And eventually. Who wins the battle. The good outcome for a plant. Obviously needs. That it. It can recognise a problem. It must know that an attacker is nearby. So it needs a sensor. And it needs to generate a signal. That is processed and transmitted. To raise the alarm. And to eventually synthesize all kinds of products. That counteract the invasion and. Interfere with the reproduction. Of the attacker. After the first part of the course we hope that you will be able to use the knowledge that you have acquired. To put yourself in the position of a plant or in the position of an attacker. And understand and know how decisions are reached. In this battleground in the second part of the course we will focus on the quantitative aspects of epidemics. We will look at the spread of diseases and best in space and time. And in the population dynamics of attackers. And we will see how. Attackers are spatially distributed in fields. An example of it. Of such studies is presented here. And we will look at the spread of diseases and pests. In fields and. On a global scale. You see. As an example here. A virus infection in a beet field. Which is very patchy. Because this virus is spread by atheists and we can study this. And we can also study it at the space level of. Regions and. Level of whole continents. And the image below. Illustrates some. Continental migrations of important disease epidemics. That have been listed. We can also look at invasions by new pathogens and pests and. Invasions by new Geno types of existing pathogens and pests. We study. Population dynamics to understand the epidemiology. Of diseases and pests. We look at the population increase. And try and describe it in mathematical models. Using models for. Exponential growth as shown here in red or models for low just a growth. Shown here in blue. And we try to describe the relationship between rates of development. And survival and reproduction. To understand the population dynamics. And describe it in life tables. And the image here on the right. You can see a FITS infesting a leaf and. These A fits. Can be reduced their population can be reduced in size by beetles. Eating the eggs. And this influences of course the epidemiology. Also we can look at spatial distribution patents. And here you see Colorado. Potato beetles. That infest the potato plant and. In the left figure here. Is a reprint Taishan of the density of the. Colorado potato beetle. In this field. And there are obviously. Areas with a very high density of beetles on a plant. And there are areas where plants are almost free. Of the beetles and it is important to sample. In such a way that we can quantify in a reliable manner. And take into account the variability. So we need to consider this. When we want to obtain. Data of counting. For sample unit. We use all the epidemiological information. In an integrated pest management system where we combine different management strategies and practices. To obtain healthy crops with minimal use of pesticides. And the components of an integrated pest management system. Are often represented as a triangle. Or as a jigsaw puzzle. Of interlocking. Pieces. As a summary. In this course. We will look at. Interactions between plants and attackers both diseases and pests. In the first part. We will focus on. Physiological mechanisms. And molecular and cellular aspects of these interactions. And in the second part. We will look at quantitative aspects of epidemics. And for further info. Feel free to contact me. If you have any questions. I hope you will enjoy this course.",

                "text": "There are different methods to heat a food product. In this Dallas clip. I will give an overview of the diff different heating mechanisms that we apply in food industry. The different hitting mechanisms are. Conduction convection. Radiation. Steam meeting and dielectric heating of the first mechanism so conduction convection and radiation are often mentioned to get or France is when we heat. A product. In a vessel. Or in the bend. We have heat transfer from the hot part. To what's called parts. So the temperature difference. In this case. Is a driving force for heat transfer. Also in the case of steam heating. We have to heat transfer from the hot steam. Towards the cold product. And dielectric heating. We have internal heating it's not a real heat transfer by that's directly he generation. Inside the product. First conduction and conduction. We talk about in the right he think through a steel wall which has a higher temperature at the outside. But the heat medium and the lower temperature at the inside of the product that you want to heat. Risk conduction. Through the wall. And it depends on the conduct of the of the wall. We often use a steel wall. Because of the. Good going to fifty of steel. And it depends on the thickness of the wall. Besides the larger to heat transfer. Area. The more heat transfer. Will be in the end. Also for heat transfer. Within a solid food. We rely on. Conduction. And other further methods of heat transfer as convection. Then we talk about heat transfer in a. What it's going to be either a liquid. Or a Gus. So the fluids. Molecules are heated. Close to the wall. The heat is this first through the liquids. By flow. However close to the wall. There's a furry limited flow. And for that reason also very limited heat transfer so infective can say that close to the wall was transfer. Based on conduction. So again we have the thickness of this. Small layer. It's. Slows down to heat transfer. And we have a certain conduct of the of this sort of. This this small layer and the bosu getter. Are combined. In a new paramita. The convective heat transfer. Coefficient. The touch. Methods that this often mention to get of it. Convection and radiation. Convection and. Conduction in a in a heating. Through a vessel for instance. Is radiation. Radiation can occur through. For instance the some. Are heating element. All energy that this. Emitted by an infrared heating source. Can be either. Reflected. Transmitted or absorbs. Radiant energy is not absorbed by the air and fecht it does not become heat. Until the object. The food to this case. Absorbs the energy. So once the energy is absorbed by the product. It results in the temperature increase. And the case of radiation. It's mainly. Surface heating. Because there's a very poor. Penetration of the heat. In the product. We use. Radiation for heating the surface of product. But also other. Transformations. Related to heat friends. For are a plight. With radiation. You can think of drying. You can think of some drying or fruits for instance tomatoes and grapes. But also for. Reactions related to heat. For instance the mayor Dacian. At the surface off of meat. And the case of steam heating. We have heat transfer due to compensation of steam. On a cold of product. In the case of indirect steam heat think. The steam will commentate on a surface. And by conduction. Of the heat through the surface we can heat. A product which is not in direct conflict with the steam. In direct steam. Injection or infusion. The steam is brought in direct contact with the product. This results in an instant heating. And a very fast efficient way of heating. It's also possible to have a very short heating time. But the product is slightly diluted for the common state. However this can be fresh stuff again. Then we have dielectric heating. Which is in fact not a real heat transfer. But the direct heating with electricity in the product. For dielectric even we need a food. With dielectric properties. Of food. Contains a lot of water in many cases. And water molecules have type our dipolar molecules. And also ions have. Dielectric properties. And a case of dielectric heating. We have Fosse heating. Both at the surface. And in the inside of the product. Comparing the different. Heating methods. We can compare their heating profiles. And a case of. Conduction and radiation we have the external he think it's his follow up followed up by. Furder convection. In the product. Or in case of. Of Soul It's a foods. Also conduction in the product. Also the case with steam is that the wrist. Steam coma say to show heat. Generation. At the certain place and furder steam. Furder convection. In the product. On the other hand. The dielectric eating. We have he directly in the product. Looking at the temperature profiles. You can see that with infrared heating and electric heating by. Conduction for instance. First the outside this heated and it takes a while before the inside is heated as well. On the other hand for dielectric heating the whole product. Is Starlee heated. At the same time. Where do you where we have the votes of molecules in the eye and. So the inside is heated. In this case. You see a lower temperature. At the outside. But that this will be due to evaporates of cooling. Because at the higher temperature. Some water will evaporate and that will lead to a lower temperature. At the surface. So a different he think mechanisms they differ a little bit. In the mechanism behind it. For certain situations the driving force is leading to the heat transfer. They differ in heat. See heating source. Can be external or internal. There is a difference between. Direct heating and indirect heating. Regarding the. Conduct or. No contact between the medium. And the product. They different. The speed of heating. And the can be internal heating or it can be surface heating. And in case of surface heating. We need further conduction and convection. To heat the product fully. We can use different he thinks sources. Can be hot liquids in direct. Heating for instance or oil or water. We can use steam. For the direct. Heating or also for the in the direct heating or use electricity. For the radiation. And the dielectric heating.",

Most foods contain quite some water and water. Is a dipole or. Molecule. Also ions have dielectric properties. The polar. Water molecules haven't run them. And orientation. When an electric field is applied to molecules will orient themselves according to the point or two of the field in a microarray field. The priority. Will alternate for a fast. So to the motor Kulas will rotate as well. And a case of. Ions it's a bit different because the ions they'll move to the. Bowl with the opposite. Charge. So the positive ions will. Moved to the negative side. And the negative side. Ions will move to the positive side. So under influence of an alternating electric field. The polar. Water molecules fill or reorient. Whereas the. Ions will move. And all these were stationed and movements will lead to friction. And he generation. And increased temperature. For further he transferred to the. Known dipolar. Molecules and I and. We need conduction. Within the food so further conduction. Into food. The absorption of the. Electro magnetic energy. In the product. Will only occur. For the food itself. Which has some water. Packaging material. Will not have. And he dielectric properties. So the packaging material will not be heated and. Only into food. There will be he generation. So in the case of dielectric heating to heat. Electricity. And there is no real transfer of heat but he generation in the product. It only works for materials with dielectric properties. So it depends on the water content. It's a very fast heating. Both at the surface and. Inside the product. However it is quite expensive because we need electricity. It's applied for the. Baking process. Only the second part because of its cost.",

                "text": "There are different methods to heat a product. You know he'd transfer by convection. Conduction radiation. Electric heating and heating with steam. And his nose clip. I will discuss. Heat transfer. By steam. Steam. Contains a lot of energy. You can see this. But this graph where we have a temperature. And the entropy given starting with water office here to Greece. Sent a great. Heating it two hundred degree centigrade. That will require. Four hundred nine hundred kilos you'll build per kilogram of water. Then transforming. This one kilogram of water at hundred grease. To what Faber. Of hundred degrees. We need to face transformation. And that requires a lot of energy. More than two thousand kilos Yule per kilogram of water. On the other hand. When we want to heat the product. The steam is coming in contact with the goal of product. So it will become the station of the steam. And the and the T. in the steam. Will be given to the product. So that's again. This amount of. Of energy that this transfer to the product. Besides this energy. We get one kilogram of water. On the station water. We can heat with steam. In an indirect way in a direct way in the indirect way. The steam does not come in contact with the product. There is still a wall. In between the product. So we need conduction. Through the wall. To heat the product. In a direct heating. It can. We have contacts between this steam and a product. This case. The steam is brought into the flow of the product or. In case of an infusion chamber. You have a chamber full of steam. And. Product product is rubbing. The mechanism of steam. Heating is based on. Instant commendation. Of the steam. On the product. A show we have steam. And it comes into contact with the water. But with the product sorry. There will be instant condensation. And this face transformation from vapor. To steam if the large amount of energy. It will be transferred to the product. At the high rate. So does a very fast and but your increase of the product. Besides the product is slightly diluted and. Sometimes we hear some. Some noise. Because the Faber bubbles will build will collapse. So we U.T. implosions that case. It is probably possible. To best price or sterilize a product. With steam. Assume. We work with such a right to steam. At atmospheric pressure. It will boil. Our condensate at a hundred degree centigrade so at this point in that case the product going to achieve them pure of hundred degrees. It is suitable for Best was a shim in case we want to get higher. We should have a higher pressure. At higher pressure. The conversation of also take place at higher temperature. So this way we can also a chief. Higher temperature of the product. So. In this region. At the higher pressure. Hired and one atmosphere. We have a boiling temperature hired and one hundred degrees and we can realize. A sterilisation. Of the product. So we need. Super heated steam in that case. The cases for direct heating. Can be done by injection. The. It injected in the product. And the product. Is instant dangerously heated or it can be done with a new infusion chamber where the product is brought into a chamber. Full of steam. Followed by cooling. By two balls. Let's look at the temperature graphs of direct heating for us in the direct hating. The first girl if the purple girth. We see for indirect heating. The product has to be heated and. Forder real intense heating to achieve a sterilisation. We need a longer time. We have such a long time. At the high temperature. So in this area. We can say. We heat the product but there are also some some. Product damage. And then followed by the cooling down. In case of. Direct he think with the steam. Again we have to bring the product to certain temperature. But this period of time. At the very high temperature we can keep a lot shorter. So it's a short heating. And of course we have to cool down the product then. But altogether. The direct heating. Has a shorter. Is a shorter heating. Which results in a better quality of the product. Looking at for instance press was ation of milk. In the rec heating. The bill quite. The build. Will be quite some he did not ration of way proteins last for direct he thinks that's a lot lower. The same is true for the loss of nutrients in this case do you mean. They will be. The real bead. Not so much loss in case of. Direct heating. Because the total area. Under this curve. At the very high temperature is just. Is just lower. So we end up with a better quality of the product. So we have a very instant he think. Once the steam touches to the product the wrist instantly think we can have it a short holding time. Which is enough for sterilisation or best reservation of the product. But it should be followed by a fast cooling is well it's going to be achieved by fresh cooling. Or fresh evaporation. And that case very cool the product. To a separation temperature again. At the reduced pressure. At the reduced pressure. The separation temperature is a lot lower. So once we bring it out the reduced pressure. The favorite will evaporate. Because at this. Lower pressure. The separation and. Boiling temperature is a lot lower as well so the water evaporates. And will be a cooling to a situation temperature. So the mechanism of heat transfer. By steam. Is based on condensation. And a case of indirect steam heating we have a constant temperature of the surface or of the wall. The transfer of the heat towards the product. In direct. Steam heating we have instant heating. It is fairly efficient very fast. And we can fulfil it at the for a short heating time. However to product this likely. The looted for it to go on as eight. But this can be fetched of again.",

And this knowledge clip. I will discuss heat transfer by term radiation. Radiation is one of the mechanisms of heat transfer that is often mentioned together with conduction and convection. For instance heating a products in a bent. We have conduction. From the stuff to watch the pen. Further he transferred. Inside the product by convection. Related to flow. Inside the product. But you also have the radiation from a heating source. Towards the environment. The experience radiation from the some or any other heating source. In the field radiation. As heat. As in other methods. Was he transfer from a hot. Site of a. Emitting source. To watch a cooler site in case of radiation only to surface of this colder site its heat is the further heat transfer inside the product depends on the conduction. And in case of liquid. Products. On the convection. Into the product. The most well known. Applications are heating or reheating a food. But in some situations where not only the heating of the outside this important. But we also want to achieve some other transformations. The radiation. Radiation is also important. You can think of. Drying a product. For instance. Sun drying. Of tomatoes or grapes are my yard reactions. Taking place. Under the influence of heat. However we should realize that except for sun radiation. Radiation is quite expensive because of its. Electric source. Infrared radiation is one of the types of electromagnetic radiation. Infrared light. It's a part of the electromagnetic spectrum. That people and counter. Most in everyday life. Although much of it is is quite unnoticed. It is invisible. But you only feel it this heat. The basement of infrared radiation is seven hundred nanometers. Up to one millimeter. And as I said. It's invisible. But we feel it is heat. All energy that this. Emitted by a source by infrared heating source. Is either. Transmit that's reflected or absorbed for heating a product. We want. Absorption. Radiant energy is not absorbed by the. By the air and. It does not become heat. Until it is absorbed by an object. A product. Because there is no absorption by air. It's a perfect. Mechanism to heat a surface. In case of absorption by a product. We get fiber ations inside the product. And the temperature is increased. You can see the product as an absorbing surface. And in case it acts as a blackbody develop be much more mature option it will be no reflection or will be no transmission. So the next time he transfer. Will take place. However only. Surface heating. Because Reza very poor penetration in the product. For calculating. The total heat transfer. We could have to Stephen Boltzmann law. It says that he the mission. By a black body is trying very new rate that related to the temperature. Even to the fourth power. It has a cause. Stint. The Stephen Boltzmann constant. Andrus effect or forty emissivity of the emitting. Material. For the total he transform we also include. The total heat. Emitting area. For a black but. Black Body. Because say. The emissivity. Is one. Whereas for a mirror. It's zero. So you can say. The larger. The area. The higher the temperature of the of the object. The more emission real. You will have. Comparing that. And that he transfer. By radiation. It's conduction and convection. We see that rests. A fairly strong relation with the temperature. So you can say. The higher the temperature. The relative. Contribution of radiation will be much stronger. Compared to. Conduction and convection. So for radiation we see the very strong. Relation with the temperature. The energy will be absorbed by the product. But we should realize its surface heating only. And except for some heating. We need an electric source. Which is fairly expensive.",

First some words about my career. Which largely took place in by having it as you do now. I also studied. Plant breeding and lining the university. After that. I did several temporarily jobs. At the Institute of the university and Research Center. Next I did my Ph D.. Implant pathology. At Boston University and. After the defense of my Ph D. thesis. I did a few postdocs inviting in. And also in Sweden. At the Ecker cultural University of Sala. And since two thousand and five. I have been working again involving and. As an eel earning developer and. Teacher. I live in Benecol. Which is a small village very close to our awning and this is a picture of my family. Showing me. My wife and my two girlfriends. I have as hobbies. Ice skating. Which we can sometimes do. Outside in the Netherlands. But most of the time we have to go to an indoor. Skating. Skating around. Which is a lot of fun. I also like playing the guitar. Which I do. Actively in the kids church. A lot of fun. My motto is always be optimistic. But not too optimistic. In this online master plan reading. I have different roles. For small bits. I am the expert teacher. But for a larger. Bits. I have been developed. Helping in developing the many courses that are part of the curriculum. As an eel earning developer. You will also meet me sometimes in some courses. As a course moderator. And which I will be supervising you. On a daily basis. And I'll be actively involved in your. Learning process. But most of all. Overall I am the student at Pfizer. As a study advisor. I will monitor you during your entire studies. Eventually I will help you to choose a subject for your master's thesis. And your internship. Most important is to discuss your study progress. And planning with you. How are you managing. Do you keep up with the work. Is it difficult to combine study. With other activities. You probably noticed story. Of the running race between the hair and the turtle. The hair of course. Was the fastest runner. But he became sloppy. And eventually lost track. The turtle however stayed focused and processed step by step and eventually. Wonder race. Maybe in some subjects. You are as quick as the hair or as slowest a turtle. But anyway. The goal is to succeed. I will try to help you to stay focused and to plan your work. I will also keep in mind. Your personal development. What is your learning style. And what type of career do you envision. When you finished studying. Also how well do you cooperate. And communicate with your fellow students. To do this. I will invite you regularly. To connect with me through Skype. Telephone or e-mail. So let's keep in touch. My job is to help you succeed. To do that. We need to communicate. And remember. Always be optimistic. But not too optimistic.",

                "text": "For different methods. Of heat transfer. You know he transferred by conduction. By convection. But radiation. By dielectric heating. And by steam injection. In this knowledge clip. I will discuss the heat transfer. By convection. It is heat transfer related to flow in a product. So the heat transfer. Is in a fluid. Can be a liquid. Can be Gus. The heat that. The fluid. Molecules are heated. Close to a surface well. For instance of Ben. And there we have molecules with high kinetic energy. This is molecules are carried by the flow. Further into the product. So the flow of fluid. Takes up the heat. And disperses the heat. Throughout the product. Since fact you can say that he dispersion. In the bulk is free fast when there is a lot of convection. However draw some limitations. Because close to the wall. Here we have the fluid here we have to the wall of the. Of the pen. We have furry limited flow. And because of this there is also limited heat transfer. And we try to overcome this. By storing in our. Fluids. So there's very limited heat transfer in this small layer. Close to the interface. And we can say in this layer. Which he transferred by conduction. And not so much by convection. For conduction. We have for US law. Of heat transfer. Very have. The thickness of the wall. So that's distinctness of. This wall. We have the temperature difference over the surface for us as the the the bulk. And we have a conduct of fifty. So that's going to fifty of this thin layer. Well then we combine the conduct of the and the thickness of the wall. We have the heat transfer. Core fissions which is no conflict of heat transfer coefficient for. This thin layer. Well we can distinguish two types of convection. Free confection is due to the. Density differences. Which are cost. By temperature differences. France and. In a beaker of water. It is heated from the bottom. In the bottom the temperature is higher density of the liquid there will be lower. Whereas in the more and upper parts. Density will be higher and. Because of these density differences there will be. Come. A flow. We also have forced convection very and homes. The. Convection. In a mechanical way. France is by storing. Or by pumping. Or by blowing air. Over a surface. While the heat transfer coefficients. Will increase. A lot by. Mechanical and homes by storing etc. But you see. And account and. Fell use for this age. For free convection it's quite low. Whereas for forced convection. It's a lot higher. This convective heat transfer coefficient in this layer close to the wall. Depends on two parts. On the one hand. The material properties. Or the fluid properties. In which the heat has to be transferred. This in turn. Depends on the com for Scotty. The heat capacity. And the conduct of the in the fluids. On the other hand. You have to take into account. The flow conditions. So the flow rate of the liquid. The thickness of this wall. Which is influenced of course by the flow rate. And the geometry. And the dimensions of the surface. Close to the wall. All the behavior of the fluids. Is captured inside. In some dimensionless numbers. It's that I know it's number. Is the plan will number. And the. NUSSLE number. They all are. Have no. I mention that I know snubber Well tell us something about the folk properties. The probable number. Will tell us something about the food or the material properties. And the Nussle number will tell us whether. Convection contributes. Strongly to the tree. Transfer of heat. Throughout the fluids. First this right number. It describes the flow characteristics. So the flow rate over the resistance to flow. Well the fraud rate is this sort of kept here to end but apparently this density. Everett's philosophy. And a dimension of. System through which the. The flow of course. And the resistance. Is kept it in a term for scarcity. So. And you know. The values of these barrel meters and in general. We know those. We can calculate the rightness number. But that I don't snub or is larger than two thousand three hundred. We say. The flow is turbulence or a lot of movements in the flow. Bres if it's lower than two thousand three hundred. We have lemon air flow. Which is free. Smooth and quiet. A second dimension this number is the probable number. And it delves something about the material ordered fluids that tells us how to diffuse Ifti of momentum. Is over to the fuse if the few safety. Of heat. So it tells us how the flow is transferred or how the heat is transferred. In case of a very low. Problem the number. We can say that if you shift the of heat. Is much larger than the for the few safety of momentum. And we can say that as a fast. This is this a basin of heat. Into the bulk fluids all this. Bence on the FISC US city. The specific heat. And the conduct of the. All of the fluids and it. Again. In general. We know these paramita. Then enough of number. Will tell us. What is the rate of better the rate of heat transfer to is is enhanced by convection. We know already that we have some conduction but that's not that fast. So we want to know where the. Convection really contributed to the heat transfer. Well we have the relation for the heat. The heat flux by convection. That. The heat transfer coefficients. We have the heat transfer. By conduction. Which includes. The conduct of the. And the thickness of this thin layer. Close to the wall. And the Nussle number is the ratio of the two. Well and the other will be no going to fifty of the product. We know. A certain dimension of the layer. And we can the rife. The heat transfer. Coefficient. This this. H. value the Nussle number. Depends on the material properties and the flow property to which is captured in this formula so the flow properties. In that I know its number. The material properties in the probable number. Was also a constant in there and there are these both numbers are applied to a certain power. But when we know that I don't and the probable number. We also know the Nussle. Number. And we know the Nussle number. We can the arrive the. Convective heat transfer coefficient. The H.. But I don't is increase for instance because of. Increase of the. Of the flow rates. Because she'd nestled it will increase and the concept of heat transfer coefficient will increase out of he transferable. Be faster. The same will be true for the prodigal number. If it's increased. Again. This convective heat transfer. Coefficient will be increased and the heat transfer. In the product. So to the movement of heat. Throughout the product. Thanks to. Confection will be higher. When the Nussle number is one. It means that the rate show of the two is one. And the fact they are the same. We can say that convection does not contribute to the heat fronts for. So there is no improved. He transfer. Due to convection. And effect we can say. The fluid which is in contact with the solid surface so it is really thin layer. Is stagnant it's not moving. On the other hand when the Nussle number is very high. We have increased heat transfer. Thanks to this convection. So this convection contributes strongly to the heat transfer. For heat. Close to the wall. Towards the product. This is for is applied to be. When we try to cool a service by flowing a cold liquid over the surface. So flow. Will enhance the convection. We have different systems very. Apply in direct heating through a wall. You can think of. Flow in a cube or in a pipe. Where the outside is heated and the inside. Where your product is should be heated. You have flow along. Around. Objects were. For instance when we are drying we have air around. Drying droplets. And the air flow parallel to a plate. For instance in a plate best riser. Where we have the outside with the help. Fluids and the inside with the cold product which should be heated. All the general. NUSSLE relation with the right notes and the. Randall is felt for all these systems. But it's adept at a little bit depending on the flow. Geometry. And the fluid properties. So let's see what it looks like. When we have a channel flow in a channel. Under Sliman. LEMON or flow so quiet flow. Which is well developed. We have a fixed number. Also. And we have an electrically heated wall. And there will be constant heat flux. And again the Nussle number is fixed. When the rest. Turbulent flow. It's a bit different we have to take into account. The difficulty a bit more. Which is reflected in this part of the formula. However when the for Scott city of the fluid is close to the viscosity of water. Then this storm. Can be skipped a way. And. Well. What's left over is this general. Nestled relation with the constant and. Two numbers with their own value. And even when the viscosity of the product is like ten times higher. This factor will not contribute that strong to the nuts and number of. Another situation. NUSSLE relation for a flow around the sphere and you can think of. Drying droplets. In spray drying. Equipment. Or for instance. In a liquid where we have big particles. Flowing in in a medium. Or in this case in an oven where we have. Again. All particles or fierce. Big particles in this case with. Air flowing around them. Then enough of the relation is. A bit. Adept at. Compared to the general. National to relation. The last situation for flow. Over a plate. Or over surface. For instance in a plate best riser. Or in an oven. Tray a belt often. Again the nothings relations are a bit depth good for this specific situation. But again. We see the right notes number. And we see to probable number. And we can derive the Nussle number of. And we need this novel number. To the rife. A convective heat transfer coefficient because that's what we want to know. To find out how fast the transfer is in a product. But if you want to determine this convective heat transfer coefficient. We have to find the red. That I know is number. And the primal number. More fodder. But I know its number. We should know this. Average flow philosophy. Difficult size of the system. It's often a dimension of the two for instance viscosity. Then we know that I know it's number. Same for the frontal number. We should know something about the material properties so to heat capacity the density. And the conductivity. Again. They are. In most cases they are known. We have to determine which type of system we have and. Which. NUSSLE to. Relation is Fell it. So it's a nothing. Relation derives from the general nestles relation. And we can estimate the national number. And once we know the nuzzled number. We can. There rife the. Convective heat transfer coefficient because we know also the conduct of T. and the dimension. So this way. We can determine the heat transfer coefficient. Ball heat transfer by convection is a lot faster than. By conduction. However. We should take a. To account some limitations and he'd prefer. In the layer close today. To the wall already in face. Close to the interface with limited convection. But the wrists. He transferred by. Conduction. So for US law is followed again. And to find this heat transfer coefficient. We can. We can use nozzle numbers. Not such relations to to determine the Nussle number and once we know the NOSSAL number. We can derive to he transfer. Coefficient wryness number and from that number will help us to find the Nussle number.",

                "text": "There are different methods. Of heat transfer. You know he transferred by conduction convection. Radiation that have steam injection. And dielectric heating in this knowledge clip. I will treat. He can transfer. By conduction. The face conduction. The connection in our daily life every day for instance when we touch. Material. The case of heat transfer by conduction. Wrist transfer of. There's movement of heat from a hot side. To a cold side. So the driving force for conduction. Is a temperature difference. We apply this a lot by heating to a wall for instance when we heat. A product. In a vessel. Or in a pen. We have an indirect heating method there. And the mechanism of conduction is that there is direct transfer of molecular. Energy. When one cites. Of for instance a wall is heated. The moly kewl will start to move more. And vibrate more. As a consequence of this temperature increase. This really Reus. Result in collisions and. As a result also the molecules that are next to this. Heated molecule will start to vibrate. And warm up. This will transfer further throughout the product in this case the metal wall Francis and. The original molecules will fire break less. And cool down again and again of a metal. We also have the electrons that can carry. And the G. True out. The product. So he had received a movement of energy. Movement of heat. But there is no physical movement. Of of molecules. They stay at are already places only the heat is transferred. So in the case of conduction we have. He tried. As for true of all the shall we have one site. Which is the whole site. At this site. And gold. Site at the other. And receive transfer from hot. High temperature to low temperature. And as a certain thickness of the wall. All the total heat transfer. Depends on this. Driving force the temperature difference. It depends on the wall take miss the ticket to Wall. The lower the heat transfer. So it's. In a first rate proportional. The material has a property. The conduct of the the higher to conduct to fifty. The more. He transferred it will be and. The larger the area. The more. He transferred will be as well. So we can combine this. In this form lever we see all the paramita. So the temperature it's affected. The driving force. And the wall. It creates or. A term or resistance. Which depends on it stick miss. The thicker the wall. The more resistance there will be. But on the other hand. The higher to come the difficulty. And the larger the area. The lower the resistance and the more heat flow there will be again. We can describe the total heat flow. But the Q.. As we did before. Or we can talk about the heat flux. And then we exclude the area and. What is left over is this conduct a fifty. And the thickness. Which is in this case. In this form right. These sets. So that gives the four years of the first law of heat transfer. But heat flux. Is described as heat transfer or square meter and. For seconds. With a unit. What Bush square meter. When we have a pen. With. Oiling water. At the temperature of hundred degrees. And we touch that. With our hands. There is a temperature difference. Sort of will be heat transfer. We want to prevent that. Because we don't want to burn our hands. So we use a pen rack. So in this case you can see the pen wreck. Piece of clots. For sure and take this. Certain thickness. L.. And this. In this case. This is the wall. And here to conduct to fifty is the conduct of fifty. Of the pen wreck. The heat flux. Again. Is described with four years law. And the combination of the conduct devotee of the. Of the piece of cloth and taken This is described with it he transfer coefficients to H.. So it's only the conduct of a T. and the thickness which are combined in there. But we also can have situations where we have more than one layer. So separate layers. Again. A high temperature at this site. And low temperature. At the other side. We have two layers. The one. First one. But a certain take Miss. And the other one with a certain techniques. And the. They both have their own conduct to fifty. So for the heat flux through the first layer we can say. The temperature difference is the temperature difference between. This point and. The one. The same for. The second layer. Where we talk about the temperature difference between this point. And this point. And again both with their own conduct of T. and their own thickness. If we combine the two. And we transfer. The formula a little bit. We get this formula various. Can see the heat flux. The different thicknesses. And the different conduct of these. And the temperatures. Well this temperature one. We don't know. We know this one we know that one but. To run we don't know. But as you can see. They can be substracted from each other so we. We don't need to know it. And we only need the high end the low temperature the combination of the heat transfer coefficients of. Both walls are combined. In one. We can combine them in in one heat transfer. Coefficient which is then the overall heat transfer. Coefficient and it's. The arrived from the other two. When we want to heat food with a pen. We want. That the heat transfer to the Ben Wallace is fast and. With a metal. It is fast because. Metals have a high conduct of. So many and still they have a high conductivity. So Real be fast. Heat transfer. The foods on the other hand. They have lower. Conductivity. France's water has. Conduct of the of only zero point six and a lot of our foods consist. Partly or largely of water so. Also the conduct of the of foods is quite low. So where we have a good conduct to fifty. To the wall. The conduct of the in the food will be quite low. So the risk conduction when we heat. Through a wall to bend the heat exchanger or. Heating into a product slightly. We have for years law which group describes the heat flux. And in a very important material property is the conduct of all we use the heat transfer coefficient. For describing the conduct of the to the wall which includes the thickness of the wall. And in case we have multiple layers. We can combine the different heat transfer coefficients. In an overall heat transfer France for coefficient.",

And this is the sort of population show you want to notice as your situation in your source population. I'm going to explain how randomization. Can prevent confounding.

                "text": "What is meant by it confounding that is what this clip. Is about. And I'm going to explain the basic idea of confounding by using an example study. And in this example study alcohol intake. And risk of Type two diabetes is studied. So when you start your study. You first of all define your source population. Because in this population. You wanted to know that it is an education between. Alco intake. And risk of Type two diabetes. The participants are enrolled. And subsequently after a well you can studied as you see a symmetry. Alco intake. And wished of type two diabetes. In the population for analysis. So does the observed result. Reflect the true Reserve that would have been observed. If you had study that you had studied the total source population or. Is there any bias. Due to confounding. Derek could be a buyer's. What is confounding. So confounding means that a fact of the exposure. In this example. Is mixed up with the F. fact. Of a lot of factor. So suppose that smoking is as or she ate it with drinking. Outcall. To smokers drink more alcohol than a nonsmokers. Is that a problem. Does it makes up the effect of. Our current basic of type two diabetes. It does. If. Smoking is also educated bit of risk of Type two diabetes. If there is no education between alcohol and risk of Type two diabetes in reality. In this it away shouldn't coop be dead. There isn't there she a shame but this. Reflect the actual. Smoking a vision of type two diabetes. And mold. Between a risk of Type two diabetes. And in this as your SHE age when your interest is. So confounding. Biased. The AS SHE A She between your exposure and your. Outcome. And it's a real silt from the fact that the been exposed and exposed group. Are not comparable. But relate to a sort of factor. So in this situation. I'll call drinkers who are also smokers. And in all now call the room because virginal smokers. So they were not comparable. Related to defect or smoking. As it introduces a bias. It is a threat for the internal for liberty. Consider an order factor. So for example. Having red hair. Suppose that having read her is as if she needed to be drinking alcohol is that a program that it's called school following and a search. Introduce a bias. No it does not biased as you see Asian. And does not call school funny. Because having read her. Is not as you stated with the risk of Type two diabetes. And I search. It's can all to mix up the effect between. Alco and risk of Type two diabetes. Although. Red hair. Cannot be disentangled from having. The drinking alcohol. So having said that for being a girl pharmaceutical funding shoot. Meet several criteria. Three. The first one. The risk factor of. It should be a risk factor of the outcome. Among the unexposed. So why do I mentioned an expose. So if. Elk we educated Vishk of type two diabetes and. Elko is positively. As a shaded fit smoking. Then out amid the plea there will be initiation between smoking and. Risk of Type two diabetes. So you should study better there is an issue Chez Sheen between your risk factor. Of the outcome. Among the. Unexposed and not your total population. So to strike and question you should ask yourself is the founder educated. Regexp Oh sure. And the turd one. Is it. Is it not an intermediate in a cold the pathway between the exposure and outcome. I didn't mention that yet but what do I mean read that. So it should not be that. Elko is causing so much of to smoke. As in issue. And as church. Causing type two diabetes. Because there is in this to do Asian. Than the effect of smoking. A type two diabetes. Is part of the true effect of alcohol on risk of Type two diabetes. So in this situation smoking fulfilled. All criteria. All three criteria. And as church. It is a co-founder. So in this clip. I used the example between. Outgoing take and risk of Type two diabetes to explain the basic idea of confounding. You saw dad. Smoking. Intake mixed up the effect of alcohol intake embrace. Of type two diabetes. And as such it affects. Into an overly ditty of the results. And smoking. Was a co-founder because it's fulfilled. All three criteria for being a confounder. Thank you for your attention.",

To indent to fight potential effect measure modifiers. And after this clip. You will know how you can use SR to fight. Analysis. Suppose you are studying their situation between. Alcohol intake. And then Cantor. You do discuss this a car notices and you observed that drinkers have a three times more lung cancer compared with no alcohol drinkers. However you wanted to know. A vet or disassociation differ across the level of a third factor and in this situation smoking. So you stratify your analysis. So you're studying this as Wish Asian. In smokers and nonsmokers. And as you can see in. Smokers that. All straight is a four point five for as a norm spoke as you observe all straight your point eight. So does this mean that their fact measure mortification. So they have different stratum says if it all straight shows. Meaning that there is effect measure modification. You should be aware how ever dared. This applies to you all straight sure. Because effect measure mortification really depends on the effect measure you're using. And I would like to explain this with his example. So suppose. We had eight. As effect measure. Mortar fire. You have two groups. One is exposed and unexposed. And you have the incident rate among these groups. Of a specific disease. So if you are stunning the incidence rate difference. So you subscribe to instant rate of. The next. Post from the instant rating exposed. You see dad. There is effect measure mortification. If you start a fire but. Age. So where it's thirty eight sixty. However. If you study in this association. In this situation the. Instant for a trade show you don't effect measure modification. So does apply to a she too Asian is to expose the exposed and exposed. Don't have to call lines told that there is in the UK much much higher increase in X. post compared to the. Unexposed. So what happens in a situation where the lines are parallel. Meaning that. At that the. The incident rate increase at the same way. In an exposed and and exposed depending on age. If you are interested in sundry. Difference. Then you will not observe. Affect measure mortification. However if you are interested in instant rage rage you know you will observe. Effect measure. Mortification. At age thirty your warped of. An instant great reach of to us at eight sixty. You observe a instant retrace your one point five. So the association differ across a level of authority factor. So there is effect measure mortification. So so to conclude. You can. And then the fight. Effect measure modifiers. By using stratified analysis. I used to be aware that the conclusion about. Effect measure mortification the pans. On the effect measure you are studying. Thank you for your attention.\n",

Off the display but you will understand the concept of effect mission modification. And you will know where it affects the facility of your results. What is. Effect mission modification. Effect measure mortification applies to situations in which the Su SE Asian. Differ. Across the level of a third factor. So for example if you are studying the officiation between. Peanut butter intake. The first factor. I know that the seller of cancer the second factor there should there for a. If they should change in different cross the level of a third factor day you have an effect machine modification. So sex may be a turd factor in extreme situations this will mean that you will find any adverse. Association for Women birds. At first as your she asian in men. So a lie to explain the concept of effect measure modification further using this example. And I will use. Real data from a case control study conducted in Sudan. The source population was to find in this study. And the case and I rolled in the study and subsequently the education bill studied in a population for analysis. There is zero are depicted in this crowd of. All my Y. axis you feed all trade shows so the risks. And on the acts. You can see do. For exposure get degrees data find. As you can see persons with the highest peanut butter. Intake had a four times higher risk to develop. I Pod to sell or cancer compared with the persons with the lowest risk. So it's human good into inability. Is high. So that there is no selection bias no. Information buys no confounding bias. What about the generalized ability of your results. To room can you apply. These results. So suppose that this study was only conducted in women. So. Are you able to generalized to a talk a publication that consists of men and women. You can study vetted as you say same IP differ across the level of sex in your own study because you only included the women. So you should look into the literature and. Look for any suggestion that there might be a difference between men and women. In this study. They also studied. Effect measure modification. By Gene polymorphism. So De have two groups. And they wanted to know. They did as you see Asian differ across the cross. At the level of this third factor. Is Gene polymorphism. If you have these D S D M one no. Deem polymorphism and. It means that a part of your gene is the lead and the search. It's likely that you are less able to detoxify Alpha toxin and. L. for a toxin is present in this peanut butter. And it is expected to beat a risk factor. To calls this kind of cancer. So deaf or they wanted to study this by Gene polymorphism. And they are suspect that there is a stronger officiation in. Persons with this know. Jean-Paul amorphous. So what did they find. There is the picked it in this graph. Over here you see a canned all straight show. And you know on the X. you see the exposure Kotecha is again. And as you can see the orange line. Portions with. There's no palm off it and I have a march. More. Higher iest. To have a part to sell her cancer. The crew. In the Wind. Are the persons. With this plus palm of his I'm. So that means that. In this group government. Know that they didn't observe Mr Shays ship. So what about a generalized ability or first built. Can you generalize the total was built. To whatever population you want. But do you think. I hope you think that this move. You are not allowed to. Because there is really a difference between these. Do you know that if you have a talk of population that school is of mainly persons with a plus Gene polymorphism. This means that there is no issues generation. Between a peanut butter and pot the seller cancer. So if you are thinking about public health and I should change then. You are you shouldn't say something. You shouldn't should do something about the peanut butter intake. If you want to reduce a padded cell or cancer. However if you talk a population of persons who have these no. Polymorphism. Then. Peanut butter. Consumption by reducing peanut butter consumption in your population. This Cantor. Bill. Be reduced if it is take the expectation. Something I wanted to note is that when you studied this. Effect measure mortification you should realize that it is a characteristic of a day. Of your data. So it's not a bias it's something. President. And use you'd better take a debt and. If you know there is effect measure modification. Then you should be careful about it generally as ability of euro's or. An F.. If it's about huge dead generalizability of years old you know death effect mission modification is a trap for the extra no validity of your results. To summarize effect measure modification. Is present. If they differ. Across the level of a third factor. And used to it realized that it is a characteristic of your data. So it's not a bias. As information by selection bias of confounding bias. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is him a fanatic and in this lecture. I will explain a little bit more. The term. Home all of G.. Why an entire lecture. About one term homo G. It's because it's a quite complicated term. And it's important because whenever we start to can make comparisons. We don't want to compare apples and oranges. So if we make comparisons in biology. It must be understood that we make want to weigh on care parents this which are fair. Now within evolutionary biology. We have to understand that most genomes. Have had in the long history in the long past. Long ago. A polyploid isolation even so dare for. No longer. Everything is to compare that easily. But first of all if you or this home ology. All it means that the fair comparisons and it can be understood as various levels. For example. Deployed. Have to home all of his gross homes that means that these two. Can be compared. Because they have to different aloose off. The same genes. This doesn't contain any other gene and that. The same genes have a different to lose. So we kind of compare. Too much between the first and the second grown with them because then we don't compare to same genes anymore. So therefore D's are called the homeowner has grown as homes. Also in morphology. I took an example from the animal field. We can make a mole of this comparison so here where you are looking at a penguin. A bat. An alligator already human. We see that this bone is a mole against a dead bone. To its home August a dead bone is a lot of those two dead bone. Fingerprinting. So this is an example of D.N.A. fingerprinting. Here. The individuals. On the X. axis are by electrophoresis separated. And we see the different D.N.A. fragments on the Y. axis. And therefore we can say. The absence and the presence of certain fragments like. Present. Present. Absent absent present present. Absent present. Present. Here we compare the same locus. Its absence and it's presence for an individual. Here present. Present. So this allows comparison. I will also introduce another term. Homoplasy. Homo Plan Z. is false. Homology. It's comparing apples with oranges. So we see something. Jus to non-genetic factors. And we start to compare them but. If they do not have. If we do not compare the same factors just similarity due to non genetic factors. Then something goes wrong. The origin of the yellow bone. Has a different. Different genes are involved in the green bones Adair for green yellow comparisons. Are not always correct. At least not this yellow with that degree. But also at the D.N.A. fingerprinting. If two fragments are employed fights. By the same piece you are making this and they code migrate from the zero. And that's what we can see. I had an example here. You see a very small. Perhaps you cannot see the screen if very small difference in mobility. So if we just would not have a good resolution in digital. Because the events are a little bit more vague. We start comparing two different products with each other and then it doesn't work out that's called homoplasy. The wrong comparison. If we want to study home ology and to D.N.A. level. We can compare sequences that are to saying that. A line at least. Alignment of the IN A sequences is that. We did we see that we put the coordinates at which the nucleotides are found that we put them on the correct position. Because of insertions and deletions we had to make a gap. When we win this sequence. Came from the sequencing machine. We had to insert a gap here. So did the alignment worked well. And another gap here so did the alignment work well. So no this see is almost like this to death see so molecule goes down. Up to the nucleotide level sequence alignments. Is required. Alignment is opening up a sequence so that it becomes. Well oriented. If we don't open this kept in the team is here. And we start comparing apples with oranges. If we do it as. Genome wide scale we compare homology because Gene. Or we compare. Paradox. And that's what the next five is about. I think we have seen this picture before it was about a plant you know from in this case from there but oma. Here we see that this was a triple occasion event old genes. Here are connected with. Genes over there because they show a great degree of similarity So all the genes. Come in three fold here. Gene one two three four five six seven etc. Also found here do you want two three four six and they're found there do so here. This picture of coaching gnomes. Shows that genes. Have had duplications or triplet case in history. And this requires no new terms if we want to study home ology. Homo G. is now subdivided in. Or to locusts genes which genes that show or thole a G. and. Genes that show. Biola bias our little bear paradox. Sorry for my pronunciation. I will simplify this. So duplications events in the genome. And we have seen that the precondition is an important part of the evolutionary history of plant genomes. Duplications requires new terms. The Homa locus sit divided. In the or through local. And the parrot oak. What we can we see on this light. Here on this light we can see in great. Evolutionary tree. So there was an insistent species. And it's resulted in species three. And then SISTER It resulted in species one. And species. Two. But before. These three species. Separated in evolutionary time. There was already a genome duplications or at least this gene was duplicated. So here was a single gene. And now the gene is present into fault. The blue variant. And the red variant. Now if Lucian ary history of the species. And the evolutionary history of the genes. Are shown and. There are more or less the same the Blue Gene also follows the same pattern it was not deleted or duplicated in itself there are not two blue lines here. And no if we want to make fair compare since. We can no longer do that we can no longer have a one to one relation if we compare this gene in. Tomato. And this gene in potato. And this gene eggplants. We cannot make fair one to one comparisons. Because the gene is present. Twice. In every genome. So which one to compare with which one. We have to compare. We can. Make. Fair comparisons between the red variance. Because they share the same evolutionary history. And then we can compare their old homologues. We have six homologues over here. But only D.C. three. Are Orthodox. They show or Sola G.. But this one with that one. Or this one. A red blue comparison. Is a comparison between paradox. So we can compare paradox within the species. We can compare. Pair Lokes across species. If we make blue. Comparison. But when we make blue blue comparisons. We compare Orthodox. So I hope. You know feel a little bit more familiar with the vocabulary. If we make comparisons. In biology. We compare. On the basis of a mullah G.. And sometimes homology is so divides in compared. Orthodox. And there paradox. Because ition of the para local in the genome can be either intend them. If it was a recent publication event. Or it can be at all to grow mushrooms because things break apart. So this notion doesn't say anything about the position. Here again. The evolution of. Plant you know most. There was a very insistent plonk from which all the rows it. Have evolved with the triple acacia events called the gum or the implication event. The whole concept of the patients and orthodox and paradox that was propagated by a system on Oh I know what the Japanese. Geneticist. And because to on or on know. Sometimes two or three locus and the paradox that whole field is dubbed simplified as. Oh we need to compare the all oaks and all the looks. It's just a vague term. Because the field is complete. Kate it's Orthodox. Separated by speciation. Paradox. Our space. Are separated by. Duplications within the species. Within the ancestral species. And here in this field this is this is a picture from an article which is worth reading in this course. And it shows even. Fitted terms. To define all these relationships between these genes. I hope. We now understand how to make fair comparisons. In biology. Based in the mall of G. or prefer Billy. Orthodox. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is him of a neck and this lecture. Is about forward and reverse genetics. Whatever. Research. We perform. It always is nowadays. Subdivided in those we are X. if. In forward genetics on the first UNIX. And it's such an important distinction as we dedicate a small knowledge canape to explain. In sufficient depth that. Difference between forward and reverse and I thinks I'm mad. And also it will become clear. What genetic thinking. Is in contrast. What a molecular biologist us. Often people come from the field of molecular biology. And they somehow. Stay. Keep their mind focused on what genes do. That's not necessary. It's a net assist. Life is simple. It has a different approach and. This knowledge clip. It is straight. In depth. What is genetic thinking. But we first start with the definitions. What is forward genetics. Forward genetics refers to the old fashioned approach. How Mendel started. He tried to explain her ribs or ether. Phenomena. Like flower colors or leaf types. So Fin it depicts variation. And he start to. He starts with phenotype ing. And in the end. He identified. Genetic load site. That were involved in those phenotypes. So it moves from phenotype. To locus. Of course by forward genetics we can continue. And now. Zoom in to the locus. So for example by med base cloning identified a responsible gene or even. The nuclear site that has the impact on the protein or on the regulation or a big biochemical function. How do. The type is brought about. That's all forward genetics. Today we replaced my base cloning more often with. Was just sequencing and comparing While type and mutant sequence. But forward genetics moves from phenotype to zooming into the responsible D.N.A. variant. Reverse genetics starts with the D.N.A.. And they observe. Look there's polymorphisms. There's a variant is that variant neutral as it's no function or. Is that sequence variance. Explaining. Different function ality S.. So here we have to test whether. Sequence variation. Can create a different phenotype. So if we didn't. Mutate or. Over express or down regulate. A certain sequence. Or a variance sequence. And then look at the product. We have made. If it displace the phenotype. We could conceive. By manipulating the D.N.A. sequence. Then we can start to understand its function. So it's trying to find the phenotype. From the D.N.A. sequence itself. Nowadays because we sequence entire genomes to buy if met this is. This is a gene. But we don't know which function that is the fields of reverse genetics. So now I will explain. More. What is genetic thinking. Genetics is nothing else. Then a test for association between phenotype. Engineer type. So. Forward geneticists they start with phenotype ing. And we can see individuals here. With or without or without or with with without reason out. A certain phenotype. We can also have. We can look at the genotype level with a molecular marker or. What ever. Essay. We can identify did at the nucleotide position in the genome. It encodes to see or altered Nativity there can be a sequence variant. Then the T. is in place. So we can see an alteration of season T. S.. And what did you notice is does it makes that. As Association. In a trice to compare. Here. Present a C.. Absent. The T. present. C. absent a T. present. C T. OK. Now we find an association. When the. C. is present on the D.N.A.. We get this phenotype. And when the T. is present on the D.N.A.. We get the white phenotype. That's all what you. Geneticists does he doesn't need to know the middle part. The middle part. Is the territory. Of the molecular biologist. Because the difference between the C. and the T. on the genome. Makes a difference. For example how the protein looks like or. In the promoter when a transcription can bind or not bind to repress or to stimulate. Expression. And then the gene product. May induce the expression of another gene which in itself. Has an inhibitor a function on the promoter of the first being. But it also can induce another gene. Which is inhibited by another product which makes an enzyme. And that enzyme make Step one in a metabolic route. To another step in a mother bolting route. And here. It's a truck. And so one whole network of metabolic route. Or a network of. Signaling of regulation. To get or that all of a molecular biologist wants to know and in the end. There's a product. And what is the product. It's the phenotype the difference between. This bullet or that Buddhist. I'm a geneticist. I don't need to know all this stuff. Geneticist make an association between D.N.A. sequence variation. And phenotypic variation. And whatever you think about it. Geneticists have to skill. And the experimental designs. TO ALWAYS MAKE THIS IS SO Sheesh and. Where did they use. Mutants. Methink populations. Or populations which are not related. And we do you know white association studies. We can always find in and. Inform the my molecular biologist. On how things work. The geneticists will make that one to one relationship. The molecular biologist may be interested in and that's work. But if there is no important. Mutant. In the gene pool. Then a geneticist will never discover this functionality. But I'm a look at a biologist may say does is such an important Gene this is a master regulator. That cetera. But we as a geneticist all the phenotypic variation. All the phenotypic variation. Must come from this single gene. Because this new going to tight. And coats the difference. Of the presence and absence of this first gene. So the phenotypic variation. Is not explained. Downstream. The phenotypic variation. Is explained. So that you net assists can teach the molecular biologist. What is the responsible gene for phenotype and. That is some. Inability of the molecular biologist. Of course I simplified. The wilt a little bit. But the molecular biologists. Look at the middle part and units assist. Associate genotype with finger type. This is forward genetics. If we first move from phenotype. To sequence variance. We are busy with forward genetics. If we go from sequence. To finda type we are busy with. Reversing effects is phenotype and genotype. That's what the previous life was about. But there are many layers in between. So all the genotypes together are collectively called the genome. Everything that is transcribed is the transcript of everything that is then translated is the proteome. Every protein that makes metal to light results in a whole metal bloom. So all the fields. We are working on the physiologist make and. If this happens then the plant will give a certain response. It may depend on the do you know type by environment. Interaction. And the biochemist may be interested in all the melech. Metabolic piles waste. And we grow crops because of proteins that we want to have understand protein Metropolitan. We want to understand starch metabolism we understand. So well metabolism because many crops. Are grown because of the fibers like cotton. So. So well mathematician is also very important. We want to understand. Where is the positions of these genes on the maps and where are cutey oppositions. And increasingly. I was interested in all these other layers. But I have. I hope. I have rediscovered genetics as a powerful thing. A geneticist. Doesn't need to know the middle part. It will always be able to associate phenotype. With genotype. And the other way around. And to finda type. Often is not straightforward. Because it can interact with a lot of things. But if there is a clear phenotype or even a quantitative phenotype. You can identify the underlying genes. And I hope this lecture helps you to appreciate the difference between forward and didn't reverse unit thinks and the distinction between Did you notice just in the molecular biologist. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is Cheryl phonetic. Today's lecture. Is about how do you know mix. Has brought about an evolution. A revolution in genetics. In evolutionary biology in biology on its own everything. Now. Has been changed. Because of genomics infects so many disciplines I know that were distant. In the past. Have unified because we all have become genome biologist. If you want to become a plan breeder. Become a genome biologist because that is if unifying field and. This lecture will show you how just doing to nomics. Has Changed. Views. We never imagined before the sequence. The driver behind you know mix is that sequencing has become more and more cheap. It is such a cheap your routine that we don't need to think about how to spend our research budget. Let's first. Not think about experiments. Let's first sequence our organism. It has really become a sequence. A cheap routine. As you can see in the second graph. By this year two thousand and five two thousand fifteen. More than one hundred planting Gnomes have been sequenced. So did you know most of mate. All the major crop. Are available. So wherever you are breeding for. Eggplant. Then the tomato and the potato genome is available by all but perhaps the genome is already. About to be published I don't know. The other story is funny because in the same volume of Nature Genetics. Did you know a strawberry was published. And the genome of go. Was published. So they were fighting who can fill the cover of Nature of genetics should we put a strawberry or should we put the cocoa paper on the first place. I think they made a creative solution. And this cover. Portrays that both you know as have been sequenced and make a nice combination in this volume of Nature Genetics. So what is the big difference between genomics and old of science we did before. Science is usually hypothesis driven genomics. Is hypothesis free. We don't ask questions we just do it because it's cheap we fill our databases. Just collected data filled with databases. And when the databases are full. Then we ask the computer. Is over in them. Or can you find Peten in the data. Oh wait. There's a lot of pattern. How can we explain this pattern. So in retrospect. The pets and points to a biological process did should be responsible for creating the thetan. So an answer a question. A biological question we never conceived by ourself already answered before we could ask the question that is the new way of doing biology. So patents in genomes patents in date that we collect later tell as. There is a pattern. So there must be biology behind it. And that's how novel discoveries. Are being made in an ever more rapid way. So how has it changed our view on evolution. Evolution started with Darwinism. Darwinism do you find that there is the scent. With modification. It was a gradualist process. Then Darwinism was combined with the loss of. Heritage tea with mutation theory. And with population and quantitative. If genetics and that's all collectively. Got a definition called male Darwinism. So here we see the pictures of Fisher who hold a feast Mendel it's a tree and. Nao Darwinism. Or in America they used the term modern synthesis. Is that combination of. The hypothesis of. Darwin and that. Everything has to be materialized in the. Net a coat. Today we are entering a new revolution. That joint. Genome biology. Is also merged. And shows that the neo-Darwinism. As a working model. Is ready for a revision. So no we call it. Neo Nao Darwinism. Or in America they call it. No longer to modern synthesis but the extended soon thesis. There are new ways of thinking about how evolution happened. And so now we can reconstruct on the basis of D.N.A. the evolutionary history. Of species in ways that were not conceived by Neo Darwinist. I give you a first example in the next light here. This is the evolution. With what happens within a species. During the course of history does that genome. Shown on the cover of Nature Genetics has tended growers homes. This is Gomez on one chromosome to come from three four five six seven eight nine ten. And on this growth was own genes. Have a position. In a certain order. So here is gene number one. Gene number two gene number three G. Number four. We take the number one. And we've asked the computer. Is there any sequence similarity in that is the of the genome. Or is this a single call preaching. And then we find out that. A highly similar sequence. Is also available at the start of grows into we. And finds another hit. That there is a very highly similar sequence at the beginning of grams of AIDS. The same is done for the second gene. It finds two more copies. So that holds true for six gene one two three four five. Etc. So all these little thin lines represent. Genes that are not there on their own they are no longer single copy sequences. But they have very similar. Genes did so to sequence. So most genes come in units of three different genes. With high sequence similarity. When we move on and grow his own one there is another block. Which goes here. Goes there and back. There's another purple block. That goes here. Goes There. And it goes there. And a blue block of genes which have kind of. Duplications over here comes up then. So wherever we look at it what conclusion can we draw. When the genome. Of a cow. Was made available. And these internal lines were drawn. We have to conclude that. In the evolutionary history of this genome. There must have been a genome triply cation. So on and SR All numbers of growth was to placated. And then. Those three fold number of Roma's arms. Were broken up in pieces and. Merged into new orientations and you see. But in the end. Whole blocks. Are still visible and make up a species. With a basic unit number of ten gross homes. But we can see that was a trip because we have no. To introduce new terms. Because there was already another lecture about homologate. But here we will repeat it quickly. What is home ology. Home ology is comparing the same gene. But we can compare. Orthodox and parallel Oaks. We don't go into great detail here. But also here we see that in evolutionary biology. There was an insistent species. That triplicated. So therefore if we look at both lists or out of a job says or papaya. Or great fine. Or cargo we always find a gene in three copies. We always find something. In three copies. So does. Event was a trip location event. But there were also later. Or more recent. Duplications events like the P.. Event. A duplications event in Pope or loose. So did. In Pope list. We don't find every gene. In pairs of three. But in pairs of six. And then hopes this. There was a better. And an all for duplications offense so that must have been a. Triploid except Lloyd's. A twelve. Do you know that. Then scrambled up. Lost a lot of genes. So by those reconstructions. We can see a lot. I don't think that ever and no Darwinist. Could have conceived. How the plant species would have evolved in the way we see no evolution is driven by genome duplications. Generating new coding space. Losing genes and. Duplicate genes. Can evolve to. New functions like. Nayo or step function on isolations etc. So this is an example. And we need new terms. We call those para Lokes and or to Los but that's an. A different issue for today. I give you another example. So in this first example we connect the dots. In a circular scale. Here we connect the dots in X. in a Y. axis. So when we try to compare sequences we can use a graph. Called the plots. So here we explain the plots. And I will give you two more definitions. Sent to me and call in air. Since the knee. Is the observation that genes. Retain remain on the same. Corresponding gross ohms. So for example if I compare potato. And tomato growers on one. Off potato. And grows on one of tomato have more or less the same genes. Organized in the same linear structure. So therefore we say that tomato and potato. Are highly synthetic. But they are not only that they are on the same grow so much because there could be inversions. Or shifts or. Reshuffling within the growers I'm. Grooms on one of potato and tomato are also highly couldn't hear. This is not true for growers only five or eleven or twelve. They have Army version so dear. They are no longer clean year. But they're still synthetic. And how could we discover those things. For example via droplets. If here. G. number one. Do you number two G. Number three. Up till G number one hundred. The last one of a not implying that a group was onus on the genes. Can be much more. But then all the genes. Are lined up here on the X. X. axis. From. For example. Potato. And here. For tomato. All the things. And then we connect. Homologous genes. And if we connect all the dots. And we get a diagonal. Then we know that these two genomes. Chromosome one of the mountain potato are highly clean here. If we observe a pattern like in the second figure. Here. The dots connect well and then the dots connect so one to thirty fifth's thirty one. Goes to sixteen and this comes down. And then it comes up again. Here. This patent typically shows that the middle part of ones you know is inverted. Relatively to the other genome. So this is a way to show a new version. Here we see it connects nicely. Then genome B. has nothing to add. But you know. A has a stretch. Of sequence to add. Perhaps with its own genes which were lost. From genome be so it was a deletion. Or you may say it is an insertion into genome a. Here I call it the deletion of B. bit of course you should understand it could also be a deletion. From an insertion. In genome. A. We can also see that if here from here on words. This gene. Connects here and here to here it connects double. But also here to connect. This is typically. The pets and you get you can draw. Make your own drawings to verify what I'm talking about. This is typically for a duplications event. So here. One. Gene one to thirty was there. Thirty to fifty. Again. Thirty to fifty another time. And then we continued to count. So here. There was a duplications event. So now we know how. Dr let's create. Since depending on the normal. Aspects of change. Insertion deletion. Duplications etc. Now we can inspect how that looks in real life. I already showed an image here. But here. The whole genome of. Out of the top says. Was compared to assist the species. Out of the doses Leontyne. And we see a whole genome dull plots. So what kind of conclusion is going to be drawn from this doc plot. Quite a number. In the first place. We can see that would be dope sis. Has one two three four five grams homes where it's out of his Leon Panetta has. One two three four five six seven eight growing as a miss. So there are. SR species. But they have a different drummer cell number. How could they be reconstructed from A and system of genome. By looking up. The comparative products. So it seems that. Graham was on one of the dopes is largely follows chromosome one. But that there may be some missing pieces going here. So this extra chromosome just. Is something from this growth. But then going here. But here. We have also the duplications and so it has retained something extra. But it is to out of it office and also here we can see those patterns. So I gave some indications it's five. First is eight grams ohms. I would have to study on is smaller than the ultra. There are fusions. Coming together of drama zones and fissions Fisher is to break apart fusion efficiency. If you lose the lot in literature because it sounds a nicely. Inversions are shown like here because we here are written into the OP. As a direction. Insertions and lesions are shown here. Here such an insertion deletion. Paradox. Are Here. Because here we have things in two fold. So here we can see from adult flaws. How these two do you know must have must have had a common origin and what happened in between that common answer. Sister until now. I'll give you another example a little the. Somewhat different way of schematic sation. So here we compare the genes. Between wheat and rice wheat growers owns. W one W. seven. Rice has twelve grams omes are one so are twelve and then. All the or total of his genes so the real homologs. They were connected with thin lines. Here. Thin lines. And then we see that. Also like we saw between at a bit of study on and the author. Also largely big blocks. Of genes. Stay in the same. Collinearity. Not all wastes into Nick because sometimes they due to other grow mushrooms here we have different growing his own numbers. We can largely see compared to genomes. He doesn't magnification. So chromosome three. Of wheat and chromosome one of rice. Here we see in greater detail so there are also some exceptions the red lines. They go different but largely we can line up these genomes. So we conclude. Rice has twelve. Seven chromosomes there are clear blocks. And there are all kind of mean variations and. We give you yet another example. This is adopt lots where we compared the genomes. Of Maisons for him. So what is you know me. Just first sequence. Compare. And watch. The pets in that emerge. This is a pet and. A random pet and. Now here. If we go to sorghum. So grows on one of maize. This is grows on one of maize. Is almost completely dare. And sorghum. In the middle part there's a deletion. But it's found somewhere else. Chromosome two of maize. Is found here. On grams and two of sorghum. Bits and pieces go here. And the bottom part of grows into its fountain grammars I'm six rooms on three of maize. Is found in pieces and the centerpiece is over here. And it goes all the way. So all this maize is present in sorghum. But if we don't look. From this direction. But from the bottom to the top. We see sort of them grow zone one is present all the way in maize. Oh it's present. Once more. Sort of them grows on to is present in these. And again. Sorghum grows on three. Is present here. And again. For here. And again. So now we arrive at a conclusion that there must have occurred. Genome duplications. So maize and sorghum. Are deployed. They're not orthotics approach so did you know duplications is not because of polyploidy they're deployed. So now we conclude that relative to sorghum. I should draw my. Correct conclusion that if the sorghum mace. Has everything into fault. So sorghum is more primitive. Has everything. In a single and Maze had a more recent genome duplications I hope I didn't say to you either way the wrong or out. So by comparing. So here we compared with sorghum you can compare a maze with rice. Maze with wheat wheat with rice. Rice with sorghum etc. If we compare. All the serial genomes. With one another this reconstruction done emerged. They think there was an insistence all you know with five different Gromit so then there was a whole. Polyploid isolation event. And everything duplicated. And then there were some changes etc and then. Rice. Arrived here. With twelve grams omes wheat. And then here. Etc sorghum. With then growing Soames. Etc etc. So what do you know mix. Help us. We can now make an evolutionary reconstructions. Of monocultural in this case the cereals but this Peten seems to comply for two more mana. Cults. It is a model of genome evolution. And the most recent ancestor you can date with D.N.A. more has. When these events must have happened. The most recent common ancestor was ninety million years old. It has potentially five chromosomes. It underwent a whole genome duplications. And all kind of translocations and that's how we can explain the shape of the serial genomes. These notions are the fruit of. Genome analysis. Nao Darwinism. Would not half conceive such things. Because there we would say evolution is driven by mutation and selection. Those were the. No Darwinist part begins. But now. We have the extended Cynthy's and we see that. The much. Other things. Takes place. We would not have been aware of with how do you know X.. So what is the impact of the nomex on biology. On. Evolutionary biology. Our understanding of the genomes of. Which we use as a plant breeders. So you Darwinian models. Used. The notion of gradualism. The accumulation of beneficial mutations. That is now superceded by siltation so. It's not mutation selection only. If the whole genome duplicate. Then you have so much space to innovate. Because every. Duplicated coding region. Can seek for. Novelties. That is how evolutionary biology is conceive that. Progress is being made. There's another thing that we know think that natural selection. Indeed happens the. Drift and neutral evolution. Hybridization some purifying selection. That they are much more prevalent. Most of rouge unary trees. Suggest bifurcations. But now we see that. From those spotty protestation events. Often a radiation of different species takes place. And this is a paradigm shift. No in fact still. New Darwinist. Notions. The driving force. Is mutation and selection but to move patients should not be viewed. No longer as a nucleotide mutation. And tired genomes. Mutate. Duplicate fuse. Merge etc. So deficient. Regarded as an extended synthesis. So thank you for your attention. We should lots of success. To realize that all the fields in biology. Have been changed and that from first sequence the genome. And as a genome biologist. We will study. In a much more complete way. What the process is we want to understand. Whether it be. The mapping. Of genes. We want always to have genome white analysis. Which is fees. Well today. So. Are single genes. Genetic experiments I've noticed. Not necessarily so. But it's much more economic to do. To organize genome wide studies. And become a genome biologist. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello. Today. We will talk about the history of an evolving definition of a gene. Why. We are at the very beginning of a course in genetics. And from the start. A student of genetics. Will be interested into no definition of this field of study. The definition of genetics in fact. The definition of what is a gene. Our topic of inquiry. That is interesting but I have to say sorry. It is difficult to tell you what is the definition. We have lost our ability to define a gene. A simple definition is no longer valid because we have discovered so much. New layers of regulation. That have more or less. Disabled us to talk about a gene in simple ways. It is the same as with B. All biology. Biology. What the definition of life. Psychology. What is the definition of mind. So it's not strange that a field. Like genetics. Has difficulty defining its fundamental units of inquiry. What is a gene. During history. On it. I'm not going to. I'm first going to talk about a teaching goals. Today we will analyze the history of a gene. And in that timeline we will concede that there are different. Moments where novel discoveries were made. Which caused us to change our perception of the gene. And that created in new definition. So we also see in that order of discoveries of the time line. A little bit of the history of this field. And often. The new paradigms. Emerged. Because you did you feel it's. Emerged like. When to buy a game mystery of new cricket as it's the Philips. And the nucleus it was. Was discovered. As being involved in. Heritage The then the definition of a gene of course. Changed or. When molecular biology. Developed and studied all the processes of transcription of translation and how deans are regulated. It also had an impact on how we have to define. Genes in the field of genetics. So what observations what methods what insights were first required. That made our parenting and our perception of a gene. To change in history. To study these topics we have this knowledge clips. And it illustrates the little pieces of a poster the poster is also available you can click on the hyperlink and then you get to the poster. That offers that timeline. There's a short article as an accompanying text to really a mistreat article. But there's also for people that have many backgrounds in genetics and already know a lot about the field. There's a more challenging article describing. The whole history of genetics and. All these different parity games. You can have discretion questions and discussions. And ask ourselves the question is mental still valid. Why do we still have to study this. Because it's still valid. Because although there are new paradigms to parody can not completely utterly replaced. Previous pair that means. So like in the radio we know that electromagnetic electromagnetism. Transmits between. How we get the radio signal. We know that it no longer travels through the eight or that it's typically a part of the change. That is final. But in genetics. Parodic and shifts are new shell base and repping. A previous show. And not necessarily replacing the original position. So we will now start. With our timeline and with our history. Of course the history starts with Gregor Mendel. Who in the nineteenth century. Discover it's an Indian genetics by doing experiments on peace. Here the laws of inheritance were first described. And he portrayed. Gene. As a discrete units of inerrancy. Contrary to his to for example a mark. Who was more in a blending. Or in that selection would be involved. But he described. Discrete units of inheritance. Big A small but a. By Did time nuclear guess its were isolated but the fiction was not understood by for the good of me sure. Then the. Men D.D. and. Papers were rediscovered by. Accordance. Mark. You hold a feast. And then you go and some a Denish person first coined the term. Gene. Because gene it was not a term from Mendel him self. And then. Genetics became a new scientific fields. Almost Morgan was. In fact his student. Start to front. Was the first. To put genes. In a linear order. Growers omes were discovered in the field of sighted genetics. But there was not yet. A merger between the work of Mendel. And the microscopic and. Observations on those little bodies that could be stained little bodies that could be saying that this guy could almost homes. Roma zones were seen by. My cross a pissed. By geneticist. And in your searches were killed collated by Morgan. And later. These two fields merged and now we know that a link which meth is a group was on map. So that's how the timeline. And you know ticks. Evolved. And after my next flight. Then. Mutation was observed by Herman Miller. By X. rays then the one and. Gene one enzyme. Hypothesis. Emerged. One gene was one enzyme or. One gene. Is one protein. Because the protein. Is the carrier of the enzymatic function. That was the. Status in the forty's. Watson and Crick. And then finally the central dogma proposed by Francis Crick. That a gene. Has a messenger R.N.A.. And the messenger R.N.A. is translated into a protein and protein gives function. Nowadays we know that there are many feedback loops. In this field so early on a gene was a unit of function. A unit of mutation and a unit of recrimination. But in those days also. Different mutants. Could compliment each other and then the functional is restored so they knew. And how could those mutants complement each other because of recombinant So then this mutation and that mutation were recombined so that the while typing together. So by the time they already understood that the unit of function the was a larger. Thing. Then the unit of mutation. Which was the nucleotides. And the unit of recommendation is between Euclid tights. So that's just much smaller unit it's resembles the way of thinking in those days where also. The periodic table. Was organized by men the left and people wanted to know about protons and neutrons and little particles What is the smallest unit of physics. Those are particles. What is the smallest unit of genetics it's a gene. But then they saw that those units. The unit of function was larger than the unit of mutation and the units of. Recombination. So here. Blueprint of a protein their biochemistry got involved. Transcribed as a goat. Molecular biology gets in full for studying the. Transcription and regulation of genes. So no we are approaching. Modern days. So the gene was then perceived as an open reading frame. With alternative splicing in. More recently when D.N.A. sequencing. Became much cheaper. If you first started to sequence a genome. And then you asked the computer. Is there somewhere in open reading frame this it. Agree with all the criteria. To call it a gene. Yes. Then the gene was just defined by a buy in from ethicist. And no biologist. Ever studied its function. And then the bio if met this just. Asked a computer has has been studied such a similar sequence ever. And you run it against a database Gen Bank and then you see that the same gene was or something home all of this was studied before and then you know. OK. It is a gene involved in. Protein synthesis or something like that and then you name genes. Just because of similarity with a database. And even. Today. People use it more in a metaphorical state that the genes. Are kind of separate teams in that you know make operating system because somehow did you know me as an operating system that has a final product which is called life. But the complexities of that operating system. They don't fit any definition anymore. We will give an example here. On alternative splicing. So. A number of recent observations. We initially defined. Gene as a regulatory sequence. So here we define. Regulatory sequences over in frame. Then we noticed. The genome is transcribed. And non-coding regions and the concept of alternative splicing was introduced as illustrated here. Here are one two three four genes but this one is coded on the reverse trend. This is double strand of D.N.A.. This is the forward strength so these are three are coded in forward orientation this one in reverse orientation. And here we see the messenger R.N.A. products from this gene where the interims are spliced out. But here. This axle escaped and. So does an alternative splicing product. Here. Oh boy. What do we see here there was also a transcript. Identified that composite. That combines the first. Interim. Of the genome. An element that had not been understood. As a coding element before. Not part of the. Gene one and two. Is in India transcript. And then it continues with. Axioms of Gene. Two so gentle itself. Is also there. But this is or. This transcript is also there. Here we can even see that. A piece of gene one and other sequences and. Entrance of the excellence of gene for to get to make a transcript. It is amazing to me that these things happen. Over large physical distances. So by now we know that the transfer that the genome is transcribed from all directions in all orientations. There are so many different transcripts and we are now studying what all these transcripts are doing they're not. Coding for protein. But they're doing that their own way. Of course we knew already that transcripts have a function on their own. Transcripts may serve. Like the writers omes. As an R.N.A. molecules that small nuclear. Arnie's are involved in splicing. Micro R.N.A.'s in silencing B.V. are an ace keep transposing signs. Yes indeed. Genes. Jump. We will have a chapter later on we will have a chapter on transposons. Genes jump around so. Also the definition that. A locus. Is a position on the ground his own is no longer valid because the locus may change. Sooner or later. Because transposons can also carry. Genes from one position to another gene. We know now about horizontal gene transfer so even. Genes may jump from one organism to another organism. So in summary. We will revisit our timeline. And we will reefs see how. During the discoveries in this field. Has changed into a different definition so the initial definition is a gene is a unit of heredity. Which determines phenotype. That is a simple definition. Then. Because of mapping. It was became a unit of heredity located on growers' ohms. Then it moved on. It's a unit of heredity. Located on Gromit zones. And it encodes. An enzyme. To determine phenotype. Here. A unit of heredity. Located some grow mushrooms made of D.N.A.. Transcribed into R.N.A. and encoding one enzyme that makes a phenotype. A unit of her and he was later on. Gene and units located on the grow his own. Made of D.N.A. it's regulatory elements. Transcribed into R.N.A. translated into a protein. Because the protein could have a structural function rather than A and Semitic function on its own not all. Phenotypes are in. Used by some proteins have. Like my nails. This is not an enzyme. It's creating it makes a new or so. Not all phenotypes. Are in use by proteins but are made out of proteins. A gene is a unit of heredity. Its regulatory elements. Into a protein that influences. Splicing here. Splicing is introduced in the definition and in particular we have seen that phenomenon of. Alternatively spicing. Here. The By If medicines they say there are many regions of D.N.A. for which we cannot give a function so we say it's junk D.N.A.. It has regulatory elements. And there are a series of messengers that can be translated into a family of protein so alternative splicing. An X. on skipping and those kinds of things. To make a long story short we move to the end. To day. This complicated to finish an is valid. A gene is a unit of heredity. Made of D.N.A. or R.N.A.. Encoding. A set of. Potentially overlapping. Proteins. So potentially overlapping. Functional problems. So not produce but. Are a nation that have functionality in their own. Our needs that bind to the D.N.A. are an ace that has occurred to let it function. Are an ace that. Influence. Splicing Arnie's that influence the turnover of R.N.A.. In all kind of ways. Influencing phenotype. In ways. We may or may not even be able to measure. So has the field escape from us. More or less. Know it because only becomes more fascinating. Today. Not every last few years. I was a. And I was shocked by hearing new discoveries that were beyond imaginations new layers of regulation. Still for. The major part of this genetic course. We can just. Improve. Arm and deal in thinking because Mandiant thinking. Is still a very powerful way to to help. Implant Sciences to help implant breeding. More than the fundamental sciences that that rely on all these. Nice more complicated issues. So enjoy. Genetics.",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this clip on the experimental design and I know from. Let me show you on the map where we are. Well we are in this series of clips on factorial I know far. And we are here. We are. This is the final clip in the series. So we go on to discuss experimental design and we take as an example in the field experiment. So suppose now that you're interested in. Potato in three protected her right he's a B. and C.. And we have a field of salable with twelve different plots. These plots are the experimental units to which the treatment should be allocated. But how should we do that. Well we have twelve plots three for I.T. So we have four plots for replicates Perth Araya T.. But how to L R K. Those for over the units. Well. Option one locate the Fridays to the part numbers in some systematic way. Maybe we can. You would like to do it in this way. You allocate the fright the A to the part numbers one two four. And then B. and then C. cetera. Or maybe you would like to do it in this way. The horizontal way. Or maybe you would go down first and then you go up again and. Look at these three different schemes. But another option would be to let Johns decide which variety goes where and. This would be a possible outcome of such a random ization. Which design do you prefer. Well. With the systematically sign you render risk that. Treatment differences are confounded by differences between experimental units. And randomization. Protects us. Against systematic variation between plots in the field. So it's better to let chance decide which variety goes where. So randomised the treatments over the experimental units. So we use a completely randomized design a C R D. So we assign the treatments randomly to the experimental units. And here with equal numbers of replicants. Randomly. Means here that possible configuration. Is equally likely to occur. The day that we get from such a C. R. D.. Can be analyzed. With just one way I know far. So go back to week number one for the details. In other experimental studies. The experimental units may be. Humans or animals of pounds. OK Well suppose that we have some extreme from ation on the experimental units now. Suppose now dead there is some gradient in fertility of the pot so suppose that the parts on the left are less. For trial than the parts on the right. In the field. And do you like the outcome of the randomness sation in light of this extra information. Well what we see here is this that the ape laws are more to the left than the C.P.. Bought some more to the right. So. And when we know that there's a fertility gradient it may not be very good location. And by changing the design we can increase the a curacy of the comparison between the treatments. And that's what we're going to do. We we're going to use a randomized complete block the sinus issues situation our C.B.D.. OK. First step then is to form the blocks and blocks are groups of homogeneous experimental units. Lots in this case and. Homogeneous in fertility. In this example. We form the blocks. Here. So the bottom one two or three together form block them but one for five to six. Bottom or two etc. And in the second step we randomly allocate the three treatments for the experimental units within each block. So maybe this would be. The allocation that we do. A.B.C. would in block one. A.B.C. would involve two etc. And here we have complete blocks meaning that. Each block. Receives. All the treatments. Now the comparison between the treatments will be more accurate. Because the treatments are compared using similar plots. Within the blocks. So differences between block will be filtered out. OK a few more. Remarks about R C B D S. So a block is a group of homogeneous experimental units. E.G. plots with a similar solid condition. In the field example. Here. But it could also be for instance plants in the same greenhouse. Or persons with similar physical conditions etc. And we randomly randomly assign the treatments to the units within each block. The data that we get from such a scheme. Can be analyzed by our Nova. And we allow for a block factor. For a treatment factor. And we use an additive model. So here is the. Well known additive model that can be used for analysis of data from such an R C B D N R C B D. Is a balance the sign. So we do not need to worry about some source Quest. If this scheme. Would become unbalanced. Maybe due to missing fowl use you may use type two or type three some squares. The main interest in an R.C. B.D.'s in the treatment affects not so much in the black affects We would like to correct for the blocks. So compared to completely randomize the sign. In the yard he would eat. Part of the ever similar squares is filtered out. It becomes the block sum of squares. So aiming for a more accurate comparison between the treatments. And then you know what table we see the split of total sum of squares into treatment someone's Quest blocks some of squares ever some squares. So let's have a look at another example a slightly more complex example. This isn't a nutritionist example where we look at the percentage of protein in a loaf of bread. And in this example there are. To treatment affect us. So we have effect Tauriel treatment structure. The first. Treatment factor is the type of flowers and we have three types. And the second factor. Treatment factor is the baking temperature there were three temperatures. Giving In total three times three nine. Combined. Treatments. The blocking factor here is today. We have three days and. Per day. All the nine treatments. Are performed. Some random order. Giving In total twenty seven observations. So we have an R.C.D. randomized complete. Block the sign but now we to treatment effect this. In the single block fact. Here's the model that we would use. So we have. Intercept main effects. For flour type and. Temperature and the interaction. Here is the block parameter in the random error there at the end. And India know if a table. The total sum of squares will be split into a sum of squares for treatment for block. And for the ever. And now. It is for Tauriel. Situation the treatments must Kwesi split further into some sort squares for flower for temperature and for the interaction between flour and temperature. OK if we fit this model in ARE WE GET THIS. So here is the specification. Of the. Well the additive model for day. For the combination of flour and temperature. We have perfect Tauriel structure flour and temperature with main effects and interaction. We have a balance the sign here so we have unique some squares we can use yet no fiction here to get you know for cable the. Testing strategy. He says before we start with the interaction with look here. And here we see that the interaction is important and significant. So we want to inspect the table of. Means of combinations of flour and temperature. And we can continue with pairwise comparisons. In this example also the block affected. So there are differences between the days of the suggested the lucky sign indeed has been a good choice. OK Well we have seen now a number of principles of Experimental the science. We've seen the three R.'s The first are is for replication. So that we can quantify. The natural variation between experimental units. And high replication at least to include increase the curacy of estimated affects the second are. Is for random the sation two for confounding between treatment differences. And the known order differences between units. And the third are for reducing noice factors. We would like to reduce scripts alone. By forming blocks. Or maybe by using call fairly gets which will be discussed in. Later clips. OK Another remark. So far we looked at X. experimental studies but there are also observational studies in observational studies there's little control over subjects and conditions. Where is in. Experimental studies we actively manipulate the situation like. The choice of the fel use of explanatory variables. In an observational study there's a severe risk of confounders which could explain if aviation why too. So the results may show up to show associations but not cause effect relations. Whereas in an experimental study cause effect relations can be established the principle. In an up the facial study we have a sampling unit so if the subject or object actually samples where in the expert in. Experimental study we have experimental units the unit to which the treatment. Is randomly assigned. Besides the sampling unit. We have an observational unit. The unit in which a response is measured. And this is called measurement units. Need be in an experimental study. The unit in which to response is measured. OK. A few more. More words about that. So in the field example. The experimental unit was the plot. Because the protected for a variety was randomized over the plots. But on which unit is the actual measurement taken. It could be that. We measured the total. Potential Use of the plot. In that case the measurement unit would be the plot. But it could also be for instance that we select randomly three potato plants and we measure the potato you put plunk. In that case the measurement unit would be the plant in this last case. We would have multiple measurement units per experimental units and. Then we have what's called. Pseudo replication. If India no finalization the grease of freedom they refer to the experimental units and not to the measurement units so be aware and. A way to handle that in this case would be to analyze for instance the effort shields of the city potato. They used. The plot. OK here's a list of terminology used often in experimental design. I'm not going to. I'm not going through this list now but stop the clip for a moment if you want and have a look yourself. And here are a few final remarks now. In this series of clips we looked at. Mostly of cases where there are two factors involved but the could be say your more effective simultaneous studies. Simultaneously with or without interaction. And into better example actually there with three factors to treat this and a block factor. If we have an higher order situation respect the hierarchy of the model terms in hypothesis testing so with effectiveness and all interactions in the model. First test positive. Three factor interaction A B. C. if that interaction would be unimportant then go to the two factor interactions and. If the second order interactions are unimportant then go to the main effects in the. These signs all the same so squares are commonly taken from the same food. And no foot. Table with all the interactions in. Irrespective of whether they are significant or not and. Final remark. Check model assumptions. In the usual way. If you have fitted and. Factorial I know for a model the cost factor of Alpha models are just examples of linear models so we can use the same methodology as we used in regression. In summary. Distinguish ups of facial experimental unit. Studies in ups of facial studies. Course effect relationships. Generally can not be completed. But can in experimental studies. Distinguish experimental measurement units. Multiple measurements. Per experimental. Unit. Lead to pseudo replication. In experimental design pay attention to the three OS replication of randomness ation and reducing noise. By blocking or the use of call faery it's. We have seen two examples of experimental these signs are completely randomized these signs where the treatments are fully randomized. Over all the experimental units. And analyzed by one way and over. And we have seen the R.C.B. event in my eyes the complete look he signed with the team and surrender my eyes over the experimental units per block by block is a group of experimental units which are homogeneous in some way. And you analyzed by two or highway I know five. Using an additive model for the block and a treatment effect it's this plus the last clip in the serious effect aerial Innova see you in X. time.\n",

                "text": "Hello again welcome to this fourth clip on. Factorial a nova. Let me show you in a minute where we are. So we arrived here. So in the clip we looked at some so squares and now we go in to look at pairwise comparisons. Of means. The question here is what. What shall we do. After significant F. tests in the two way I know far. And typically. Like in one way and we make pairwise comparisons of means. But which comparisons are of interest. The pants on the result of the F. test if the interaction is important then. Probably we would like to compare means for combinations of levels of. The treatment factors. Or maybe we would like to compare means for levels of one factor at different levels of a second fact. If the interaction is not important. The main effects are. Then we would like to compare means for levels of. Individual treatment effect us. And if we did not find interaction. Nor main effects then probably we don't want to make better by comparison had all the methods that can be used for pairwise comparisons are largely the same as in one where you know fast so meaning. To test for a difference of two population means. We can use the L. as the least significant significant difference as a yardstick to measure. Where the differences are significant or not we can make confidence intervals for difference of to population means. Multiple comparison methods are available but. They are beyond the scope of this course. Maybe you have to go back to D.C. area one where you know found two to look up the details. So again let's look at the tomato sweetest example where there were two factors. Type of tomato a ripening generation. Here is the table with six sample means. And here we see a no for table that we that we have seen earlier. This is a nice balance situation so we can use the. You know for French and here. To get you know for table. The conclusions based on the F. tests are as follows. So we do not find any significant interaction with B. values point nine one. Much larger than the five percent threshold level. We do find the main effect of type. With the P. value smaller than five percent and we do find the main effect of ripe with a B. feel you. Again. Smaller than five percent. So no interaction found here so we go on to focus on the main effect of type. And of arrived in the additive model. Well for to major types there were three types. We can make three eat there by comparisons we can compare the sherry. And compare it with a decent people as the reference group. We can compare to round. With the beef tomatoes and round first to share it. To formally We want to test the hypothesis. So we can formulate it using the marginal means where such a module mean. You I doubt it is the. Efforts over the. Means for type I offered it to wrap in generations. And the no hypothesis says that these two modular means are the same. This is these no hypotheses are equivalent to if we work with an additive model where we use the restriction of Alpha one is equal to zero as our does. And that Alpha two is zero. Corresponding to this first there was difference. Alpha threes equal to zero. Corresponding to the second one run first as beef. And Alpha three minus two is equal to zero. When we combine to compare groundfish Sherry. Well why is no extra work needed for defect arrived well. Bribed is a factor with only two levels so the F. test. Gives already be answered that we need some of the pebbles comparisons that we were interested in. We obtain them for free. If we fit. The edited model of a hair. And we look here at the co-efficient. This is called Shoot Alpha two. That's the coefficients for Type C. actually. If you remember. This is a difference parameter it compares the sherry tomatoes with a reference group. With the beef tomatoes. So this. Estimate here. Estimates the difference between these two groups. We can use the T. test. The outcome is four point two three. The P. value is point zero two not point zero zero two nine much more of the five percent so. It's significant different. There's a significant difference between Sherry and beef. For the round. We make comparisons of around with a B.. We can look at the Alpha three parameter. Estimated to be point one three. If we take calculated the value. Point eighteen. And the P. value. Is quite a bit larger than five percent. So we do not reject in the hypothesis there. We cannot find the difference between the round and the beef. Tomatoes. In this we test. There is still another comparison to make. Namely the comparison between. Sherry and round. For that we have to do a little bit of work. We could for instance used to function. L S means. Sorry. At least Queer means which is hidden in the in the package. Our package LS means. And here we can specify which pairwise comparisons to make. We want to have pebbles comparisons for type. And here we have to specify a just as none because in this case we don't want to have to make corrections for multiple comparisons. And the output that we get here. Are just the predicted means for the three groups. And here we have to pair was comparisons B. First a C. is. We already have the first is are we already have that the first are is the new one. And the estimated difference is equal to twenty point six. Teeth are you for part of five and a piece always point zero zero three seven so a significant difference there is well. OK let's switch to the second example about the attention span. Remember there were two factors of the class and. We had two types of commercials. Which wish. Shown to children. Remember we had and balance the sign here with equal numbers of replicants. And here are is a little table with a sample means. Here is you know for table that we have seen earlier. These are type two Simpson squares and. This was constructed by repeated use of the end of a function. And what do we see here well. We start always with the interaction so. We have a very small piece you for the interaction we find a strong interaction between a chin type of commercial and. That means that we are not going to look at the main effects anymore. And because of the significant interaction. We want to focus on the six combined levels of. H. in type of commercial. And we can look at all the pairwise comparisons. And that gives fifteen pairs. So again formally We want to test these fifteen no hypotheses. But it could be that you're not so interested in all of these comparisons but maybe only in a subset. Like a comparison of age classes within each specific type of commercial. OK. How do we get these all pairwise comparisons. Again we used to tell us mean functions now we want to make comparisons. Among the combinations of the A in the B. fact the levels here are the predicted means in the different groups these are just the ordinary simple means actually. Now. And here are all. The contrasts all the. Essence are being made here. Maybe you're not sorry enough interested in all these comparisons. Maybe you only want to look at a subset of pairwise comparisons maybe you would like to look within the breakfast cereal commercial. And want to compare the H. classes that you would pick out these comparisons. We find here that there are none of these differences are significant. So within the breakfast cereals we do not find any effect of age at all. And if we switch to the physio. Game commercial. We make the pairwise comparison then we see significant differences. Of the thirty first the first last and the third first the second class. In summary. After the F. test in the two way I know for table continue with there was comparisons of means using T. tests or L.S.D. or confidence intervals as in one way I know for. If the F. test for the interaction is significant. Then make pairwise comparisons of combined levels of the two treatment effect is to look at the table. Of means for both affected simultaneously in that case. Not all the comparisons may be of equal interest. And if the FS for the interaction is not significant. Then you may continue with the additive model and you may compare levels of individual factors by pairwise comparisons. Thanks for your attention. And see you in the next the final clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to the third clip. On for thirty one no fun. Let me show you on a member we are. So we're over here. So after introduction in and clip about. Interaction now we look at. Inference based on some squares. So we once again look at the tomato sweetest example I remember there were two factors. Type of tomato beef share your ground. And there were two ripening generations long or short and the response was the sweetest. Here's a little table with six sample means and. We would like to construct the unknow for table now and for to start with we look at the means model. So we treat these two way. Situation actually as a one way and ofa. And using combined effect to levels. And let's construct you know for table once again. This is just a linear model. So we use Lee's quest to estimate the parameters the perimeter Saddam use. And days. The least ques estimates are very simple just the sample means. And if we don't calculate the sum of the squares of observed mine the sample means we catch the S S E. Everson was Chris or will be in groups or more squares. We would like to compare this full model with. The simplest model. Possible. Containing only. The intercept only Dimmu. Least ques estimate what it knew was just the overall mean so the sum of squares of observed minus the overall mean gives us the S.S.T.. The total sum of squares. And the difference between the two. Is the. Treat and some with squares. Some as quest for treatments or between groups I was quests models of squares. So let's fill be an over table now so here are the crease of freedom we have twelve observations in total for eleven degrees of freedom for total. Twelve minus six year old six degrees of freedom for the winning groups in which squares fly for between. Here is the our code. To give us the. We said you will the air or some such squares for the food. Oh. Four hundred two point two. It goes there. Here we fit. The simplest model possible. That gives us the total so much squares in the difference between the two. Is the models of a square us. OK. So we can of course use the N O function in ours. To get this. An over table they want to go and. Well once again here we have five degrees of freedom because we have six type right. Combinations here. And with the F. test statistic here we can test the new hypothesis whether. There are any differences differences. At all between the six means. The conclusion here is that. There are differences or at least two means are different because the P. value. Is point zero three smaller than the threshold five percent. Now the next question is we know that there are differences. What is causing that is it due to right. To type or. Due to the indirection. So for that we need to effects model and. With the effects model we will try to split the. Treatment somewhat squares into components for the interaction. For the main effect for type arrived. How should we do that. Well. Recall multiple regression. We can compare. Ever since the squares for models with and without the tomb. And we can compare the food and reduce models. We should start with the interaction first. So we compare error some squares for models. With and without. The interaction. So we compared the interaction model but the additive model. And if we do that here we fit a full model and the reduced model for here. If we take the difference. We get the sum was questions you to the interaction twelve point five. In this example. Next we would like to have some so squares for. Main effects of type and of right. But which model should be compare. Well first thing to say is that. We only want to look at main effects if the interaction is an important. If it is removed. So then we compare this additive model where there's no interaction anymore. With this model where the alpha. Parameters are removed. Here it is done in R.. So this is the model. Yet at that model research will somewhat squares this is the model when we leave out type. And the difference between the two. We see just sums of squares give us the sum was quiz for the main effect. Type. And we can do the same for ripe. Now we leave. The B.J. parameters from the edit the model. And the difference now gives. Seventy seven nineteen point nine seven five. Which is that the sum of squares for the main effect of ripe. If we add up the sums as quest for the interaction. For the main effects. We nicely get nine hundred nineteen point eight eight. Which is the same as the treatment was quest that we got in the start at start. OK Well this is quite cumbersome to do it in this way so we also have this a no for function available in our. So if we use an over here. We directly get the sums of squares that we calculated ourselves a minute ago. So this is easier. Of course but you have to realize here that the a no function. Bests we send you some squares of all sequence surely sequence your sums of squares are produced here and they are also called I Want some squares or accumulated sums of squares. Sequential sums of squares and. So what are is doing here it starts with a model with only the intercept. Then it. At Stipe. And it. Reports the difference. If we see do some squares. And then it. At the ripe. And then again it. Reports the difference in recent years some squares between these two models. And it. At the interaction and. We nicely see these jumps which are exactly the same as what we calculated earlier but please realize that for. Time. The model comparison. That is made here for tripe is not the same as what we did earlier. Nevertheless the same squares. Are the same as before. The reason for that is that we have a nice balance situation here with equal numbers of replicas. In all the groups. So the conclusions from the a no for table here. We start with the interaction. So we do the test for interaction. The no hypothesis says that there is no interaction so-L. those interaction parameters are equal to zero. The test that is thick is the mean square of time. By ripe. If either by the M.S.E.E.. It gives outcome point zero zero one three but people you point nine. Larger than five percent. So one clue should is that we do not reject the no hypothesis we do not find any evidence that there is an interaction here between two major types and ripening duration. So the other the model. Actually is good enough. And we continue now with. Test for main effects for time. Therefore ride. So we test the main effect. Of tripe formulated with parameters now using these Alpha asked people these are parameters from the additive model. And the test that they stick is the mean square of type. They're divided by the end as. He deals eight point eight six would be value point zero one six more of the five percent so the conclusion is that you reject the no hypothesis here. And we test the main effect of ripe in the same way and we find once again. A significant. Main effect. Of ripe. OK let's switch to a second example. This is the attention span example that we saw earlier. The response. Why. Now is the attention span of children in minutes. There were two sectors in full fit which class with three levels. A one A two A three and a were two types of commercials. Breakfast cereal commercial in the video game. Commercial was shown. So in this case we have an imbalance this time with an equal numbers of children in disapproves and that is quite important actually. At the bottom here you find a little table with sample meets in the six groups. So let's start again with the means model. We use the I know far function as before. We can test. The no hypothesis whether there are any differences at all. And the conclusion here is that the value is very small that. At least to me is a different in our next question as before is this due to the interaction due to main effect age. Class. And or. The topic of the commercial. So again we would like to split the treatment some squares into components. OK so for that we can use the effects model here. And here is the UNO for table at the bottom that we go on to fill. And for that. We want to compare Simpson squares ever since the squares of certain models. So let's start with the interaction model. Here is the direction model. Here based what we can do in ARC to get the be seducer most quests. And here it goes into the N.L. for table. And this. Interaction model is compared with the simplest model possible. With only demean you is. It is in the model. Called the models called M. five here. So here is what we can do in our to get there we said you so much quest of this model this is the total sum of squares. And here it goes at the bottom. So actually the model sum of squares. Is just the difference between the two. So does this amount that we want to split this amount into different components. So first we want to have some was quest for the interaction. So we leave out the interaction. And we fit the etiquette model. I'm too. Here is what we can do in our we get. And he said you are somewhat square. Yes and if we take the difference between. And one and M. two we could hear the sum of squares for the interaction and. For the main effect. For the main effect of each class. We remove the last parameters from the additive model. So we fit it model and three. Gives us. Every citizen was queso we take the difference between researchers from squares and it brings us this sum of squares. So most quest of age. And in the same way. We can get some more squares for the type of commercial. So this is the way we can build up the N.L. for table. And now. Again. Quite a lot of work. And in the balance case we can use the N O five function though. Will it work here as well. So we can. We can try two different orders actually. So we can use a no for and then put a first in the model then began the interaction. And these are the sums of squares that are is reporting then. But we can also use a different order. B. first then a. And then the interaction. And now please note that. We get different some squares so do. The sum of squares for a if it enters the model first it's not the same as when it enters off the B.. And the same for. Effect to be. For the type of commercial. So be on its own. As the first one will not give the same sort so much quizzes be author a. So we see it as something squares become. Or dependent in the unbalanced case. Put into action. We don't see a difference because in both cases the interaction and this is the last one. So for hypothesis testing it is important that you compared to right models. So for interaction it's clear. We compare the model. With the interaction of any direction mother with the edited model. The main effects. We typically would like to compare them oddly edited model. With a model containing a single term. So we check for the effect of a after correction for B.. And we check for the effect of be off the correction for a. This cannot be obtained with a single call to a no fine R. anymore. The sums are squares that we get but if we use these comparisons are called back to some so squares or partial sums of squares. And please note that here in this and balanced case the type to some squares are not a nice split of the treatment symbol squares. If we add up. These different. Main effects something squares in the interaction sum of squares. We get a number. And some US from this quest which is quite a bit different than the. Treatment I was quest that we got from the. The means model. Besides tied to some sequester also type threesomes or squares. Which differ in which models are being compared. And they used by many. But generally they're not to be preferred. In summary. Means bottle. Yields and I know for table. S. in one way I know for showing the split of total sum of squares into and somewhat squares and ever so much squares and so much Chris can be split. Split into some sort of quest for interaction or for main effects. Some sort of quest for interaction of four main effects are obtained by taking differences of sums. A fair assumption squares of set models by X. clued ing. The term of interest from the model for the balance the signs the split is unique and some squares and not order dependent. For unbalance the signs this political usually not unique. And simpler squares are order dependent. Start have offices testing with Indian. Interaction. And if the interaction is unimportant. And continue with the main effects. And use type two or type to the same so squares. Thanks for attention and see you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello my name is Edith Fisk and. And now I'm going to tell you a little bit more about the burden of disease. And especially the global burden of disease study. But first burden of disease. What do we mean with it actually we usually talk about this when we quantified the gap between the populations currents. Help. Status. And an ideal situation where everyone in the population lives to all. Age. And in full health. So again. It combines. Information on mortality and morbidity. Usually the burden of disease is measured. As a dolly. The disability and just that life years. And this started with the. Conception of the global burden of disease. Study. Which is being very influential in this field. The first. Global burden of disease study. Actually was reported by the World Bank. In one thousand nine hundred three. Investing in health it was called. And this shows also the economic evaluation economic evaluation side of this study. And of course. It was the World Bank who financed this study. In collaboration with W.H.O. and Harvard University they expended. And the first full publication on the first global burden of disease study was published in one thousand nine hundred six. And it covered the situation in one thousand nine hundred ninety. So assessment of mortality. And disability. From quite a number of diseases and injuries and risk factors. In one nine hundred ninety and projecting it into. Twenty twenty. Actually I said already it was a for an important study. They introduced a new analysis and. The development of the dolly. The dollies at that time. Included also. Age weight. And discounting. And what do I mean with. Age weight is that. Said the help. Potential of a young person. Is larger than the health potential of an older person. So. Age was taken into account in the calculation of the dollies. And actually also there was something which called. Discounting which is still used in cost effectiveness analysis. That you say. A future health gain. Is less important as an immediate health came in time. So this is. Discounting the edit. Healthy years. Added later in life. The three major objectives of the global burden of disease study. Was first and foremost. Inclusion of non. Fatal health outcomes. Until the time we merely had policies. Based on mortality data from W.H.O.. It also also an independent objective evaluation. And that's very important and. We used a measurement. That is comparable to that is used in cost effectiveness and Alice is the quality. The quality adjusted live years. So all in all this resulted in the Dolly. But also heavy and heated debates on whether or not to wait for. Age or not. And especially the age was under attack because you can say discriminates against all the people because they were regarded. To be of less. Help potential. Actually in later years their age or waiting. And also the discounting. Were dropped. The most recent study was done in twenty twelve. And it was carried out by the Institute of Health. Measurement. Evaluation or health metrics evaluation in Seattle United States. And it included a comprehensive assessment of the burden of disease in twenty ten. Including a comparison with nine hundred ninety. And it uses the W eight H. zero set of the dollies. Which were and which relevant for for the year two thousand and two thousand and eleven. So the report included. The burden of disease. And injury. For twenty wrong wages for example. Western Europe. Or Western sub-Saharan Africa. And the five main World Bank. Regions and over one hundred days. Cvs is. In divided into three groups. The communicable diseases the infectious diseases. The non-communicable diseases such as cancer cardiovascular disease. And injuries. Although they towered specified by age group and by sex. And I was also a wealth of information available on the risk factor attribution. To these diseases and other health outcomes. In any case for sixty seven. Risk factors in total. So you can see it was a huge effort. It's important to realize that the years of life lost. Which you remember. I hope. Are needed to calculate the dolly. Were based on the Standard Life table with life expectancy eighty two point five. Where do all these data come from well that's a good question because data availability in this type of studies is always a problem. You have to remember for example in the Netherlands we have a very good statistics on mortality we have a good mortality register. Including causes of death. We have a very good cancer registry. But we don't even have a registry on cardiovascular disease. And that's in the Netherlands a quite wealthy country. So you can imagine what the situation is. In other parts of the world. So to fill in the guess. They used two ways first. Expert opinion. By expert panels and. Expert groups. And the second one which we can call mathematical gymnastics. And this is looking at the model and. The model it is used is a dismount. Model. M.R. which stands for meet or regression. And in this case. They use data from. For example a similar country or in a region to plug it in or from related data from the same country. But. For example on an order type of. Outcome. So for example if you're looking data. On the incidence of lung cancer. You can use the data on the mortality. From lung cancer. To estimate the incidence. Although all this. Kinds of tricks were used to fill in the gaps. So you can imagine. It was a complex. This. And there was some criticism regarding the lack of transparency. Actually nowadays they are still working on the next one. And there is a practical and this protocol of variable from the website. Is quite clear so I think you should take a look. So what is the main message while the first message was that. Most of the rules population nowadays is living longer and dying at a lower rate. So here you see the mean age or death in night at nine hundred seventy. And on the X. axis you can see the mean age at death. In twenty ten. And you can see that. The most areas are all on the lower right hand side of the graph. Meaning that the mean age of death in twenty ten. Was much higher or higher than in one nine hundred seventy. You see here for example the various areas in the world. Another message was that leading cause of this is really shifting. And we used to have a lot of infectious diseases. But more and more it is shifting to the non-communicable diseases such as. Cardiovascular disease and cancer. What is also shown by the first global burden of disease. Study already. That we have many more people with disabilities. How come. That's easy. Life expectancy is increasing people survive. Their diseases. Because of the good health care. For example. Especially in the middle and high income countries. And therefore we have more people with decease and with some sort of disability. Also we saw tremendous progress in sub-Saharan Africa. But still major challenges remain. I depicted here the eight Millennium Development Goals and if we see a man. Develop and develop and go. Four five and six Under five years of age mortality. Maternal mortality. The spread of HIV AIDS. There's still a lot of work to do. The final message was the importance of the risk factors and also the importance of the transitions in ways. Factors. We saw for example in the Western world a huge decline in cigarette smoking. In the past twenty years. And this really showed corresponding the Kleine in for example lung cancer in men. But we also saw an increase in smoking in women in an increase in smoking in pantries such as China. With a corresponding increase in. Lung cancer mortality. In those populations. So what are the lessons. Well. First and foremost. This is. It cannot be stressed enough this is a very important study. Because it included for the first time. Non-fatal health outcomes and actually for the first time we got a global few. On the health situation in the world. And also on the importance of the Ferias Fiske factors for those diseases. It also showed us there's still a lot of data which are not available or which are uncertain. So for example in developing countries. We even like. Mortality data in some cases. And in the western world. It's also clear that we don't have enough data on long fatal health outcomes. We also look at the compare ability of data and for example in the causes of death there are really quite large. Coding differences. Internationally. Between the countries. Which of course also affect the ability of the. Conclusions and the results. And the final thing is that the dolly. Appeared to be relatively. Insensitive to this disability waits while we have spent so many discussions on these Wait. And that was really from metallurgical point of view a quite nice discussion. So all in all we still use it as an important source for our and gender setting. So in summary. You learned now about the burden of disease and it's most important study the global burden of disease. Study and. You also know now. A little bit more about the history of the Dalai.",

                "text": "Hello my name is Edith fess concern in this clip I'm going to tell you a little bit more about the different measures and actually what we call reflection on the different nations. Because we have learnt quite a lot. Now. I know it maybe seems to you even like a jungle. We have so many summary measures of Public Health. And you may question yourself which one should I use. And actually we always start with the main question What is your objectives so why would you measure health and disease. Well. In general we'd like to inform the policymakers. For example on the status of population health. How many deceased. If they are diseased. And healthy which part of the population. Is in this case unhealthy. We also like to see the trends for example to monitor or Eve see any change in policy is reflected in any change in health. In the population. Or we'd like to compare different groups say with high or low social economic class. And in the end of course we always use this for priority setting or which problem or disease. We'd like to spend our effort. Or our money and. In which region or rich country should we focus and for this. We always make a need. Rankings. What is the biggest health problem. So this is the main issue. How to wring. All these problems. To rank all these problems. The always need a one dimensional scale. So the higher score is better for example. Then you rank all the problems and then you can see. Which problems is most important and you should put your effort in. If we think about money one measure. There are many aspects of health to think about the mortality. The mobility the quality of life. And many others. So when we talk about summary measures of population health. We combine these aspects of health. Into one measure. Alternatively we can look for example only at the ultimate end point which is for human beings. Death. And then there are several options. We can look at the number of deaths per one hundred thousand persons for example so this gives us an idea. About the absolute number. Problem. The absolute help problem. But if you want to compare two countries. And one has an older population then the other one. Of course you'd like to standardize. For sample for. Age. We can also think about looking at the life expectancy. Estimated at birth or the years of life lost. The potential years of life lost or the expected. Years of life was note. For example that. The years of life lost and life expectancy. Give more weight to death. A younger age than a death at. Older age. So accidents which are clear mostly at the young age really affected the potential years of life lost more than other causes of death. So this is an implicit. Value judgement an implicit. Norm. With you take into account all you have to think about this before you start your analysis. When you think about looking at morbidity. You can look at simple measures of mobility and E.P.D. neology reduce the prevalence of this sees. How many patients I have at the certain time point or. At the incident of the disease. How many new cases of a disease develop. During a specific time frame. We also have disease specific summary measures. So the disease specific information on mortality and morbidity is summarized in two for example the Dalai. Disability. Adjusted life years. Or. For example in a dementia free life expectancy. Or. In that case. Any disease free life expectancy. And finally we have the generic summary measures. So they are based on generic information on mortality and morbidity. And this is what we see in the healthy life expectancy. So this is the final skew. Scheme. The overview of the summary. Measures for public health or population health I would say. You. You know you look at mortality you can include mobility. And in this case we have gap measures and. Expectancy measures. So when we focus on more talented we have to get measures for years of life lost and. Expectancy measure. Life expectancy. And then we include mobility we can have to. Flavor us a new way to present or not or. Waited. So too according to full health. Equivalence. For example the dollies. Using weighing factors. And we have a generic Dolly. And we can have a disease specific Dolly. If you think about the. Expectancy measures we have many more flavors the life expectancy can be expressed in many ways. So we have a disease specific one. Which is not weighted because it's disease specific. You can see it is here. Or you can have an. Unweighted. One which can be generic the healthy life expectancy. And life expectancy without disability. There are expectancy measures. Generic and not weighted. Finally again. In relation to the dolly. We also have the disability adjusted life expectancy and the health adjusted life expectancy. They are expectancy measures. They are weighted and they are generic so we include morbidity. So in this scheme you see older. Measurements we have discussed. What is important when you compare it to situations for example to policy in this case smokers and nonsmokers can realize that. The difference in life expectancy is the same as a difference in years of life lost so then the expectancy measure. And the gap measure. Are giving comparable results. So when we talk about. Life expectancy is the area below the curve. Below the curve. As cigarette smokers or below the curve of the nonsmokers. And the difference in life expectancy is this small area. But if we think about the gap. Measurement. We look at the area up of the curve. And the difference between the area above the curve for the nonsmokers and the smokers. Again. Is this. Small area. So you can see the difference in life expectancy is exactly the same as the difference in years in life lost. However there are also differences between the two. Traditionally expectancy measures. Are expressed for a person. So for example if I quit smoking. I gain seven years in life. But get. Measures. Are more expressed for pub pollution. They sound. Much more impressive because one extra day of life expectancy. Like I said in a proper person. Can also relate if you have a large population to forty thousand life years gained. So then the size of the population. Really is important. So if you communicate this to a patient or if you communicate this in the media. Be aware. What this will do with the framing of the situation. And how the people will perceive the importance of such a health problem. When you are expected per person versus when you express it. Purple pollution. So nowadays also some people use the Darley per person. Instead of population. And then. We call it the ME call God. So which measure would you use. Well. It's a matter of taste I would say for different situations. But you have to be aware. What do you want to do for the description of what you do you want to focus on the potential gain or do you want on the focus on the situation the health situation like it is now. For disease specific questions. Of course you probably used to see specific measures and. For comparison. Across the seas is. Of course you will choose more generic measure. So in summary. In this clip you have learned about the summary measures for Population Health and how they are compare. Can be compared to are not comparable. We hope you now. Know a little bit more about what. To use in which situation. And that's in some cases choice is really a matter of taste.",

                "text": "This clip will be about membrane technology in food engineering more specifically. The way that we should configure processes. In the food industry to do to do the right things. There are many different. Membrane processes which are used in the food industry. Like for example reverses Motors nano filtration. For really getting rid of the smallest. Components alter filtration for proteins and carbohydrates. Microfilter ation. And filtration for particles. But we still need to put them in a specific configuration. To achieve the goals that we want. But we can apply these membranes either in batch mode or in continuous modes. But small is typically on all the smaller scale where you only want to tweet is a limited amount of material while continuous filtration. Is the continuous. Treatment of material. Through a factory. We're going to do different types of things we can either simply reduce the volume of a specific stream. So concentration. Or we can use a membrane to two to rinse out certain components while retaining other components which is called by a full tracing. And of course we can do both activities either in bytes or in continuous modes. If you go to the batch mode for concentration. We basically see the situation here we have a limited amount off. Of raw material which we need to treat. And we do that by running. This lake with. Over a membrane. Which every danged notion material which we. Which we which we don't to collect. If this is an interval tracing membrane this this could be a solution of approaching for example. So there for the protein is retained. But since we have a continuous outflow of permeate. We will lose part of the volume. And therefore the same amount of protein will be dissolved in a smaller and smaller fully. Of liquids and therefore of course the concentration of the will of the protein will go up. Well if we keep the permit fully in constant. Then the change in volume. Will be constant in time. And this will be it will result in a concentration of the protein which which becomes higher and higher. Because the amount of protein will remain the same. While its volume. Will decrease. Linearly. And therefore if you plot that as a function of time. You see that the concentration of the protein will very slowly go up. And so at the sets a certain point it will go will go up more and more and more. Of course you cannot go to a concentration of one because then it will be a solace and therefore you have to stop somewhere before. For example the membrane becomes felt or maybe even this dissolution will. Will gel by itself. So this is BET's most we can also do this for larger factories in a continuous mode. So here we would have a membrane which we continuously supply with a stream for example this would be the in the dairy industry or in the fruit industry. Or maybe even in the beer industry. So here we would supply. The feet. Continuously and there who would also take out the resident dates. Continuously. In time. At the same time we will actually lose. Part of the liquid through the membrane. In the permeate. And the more liquid to be correct in the permeate of course the larger the concentration of the retained components are in the resin thanks so for example if this is an older filtration membrane. Then the protein will be at a much higher concentration in the resin tight. So for example if we start with this. Amount of fluids. And we separate out ninety percent of the. Of the liquid. In the permeates and we are left with only ten percent of the solution here. Of course the concentration of the protein he will be will be ten times as large as there. As long as the membrane. Will be completely close to this protein. And it will be completely open to the other components. Of course we can easily find the concentration he. Year. By a must balance. Usually these are done with the help of the permeates recovery which is the ratio between the. Permeate. And the feet. And therefore if we apply this for this we can easily find the concentration. In the retina tight. As a function of the concentration in defeat. And a function of this permeates recovery rate. So this is how. Continuous concentration works. Then the other. Operation was diaphragm tracing. And here we do not want to concentrate the product as such but because we want to get rid of some other components for example smaller molecules. If this would be approach the solution we might wants to get rid of like those or other sugars souls for example. And with that make the solution pure for small applications we would use about once more we have a vessel. In which our feet is present. We would run these feet continuously over a membrane. And we would generate. Permeates through the membrane. And the component which dissolved in the permeates will leave the system in this way. The difference. With the concentration system is that we now. Supply a water stream. Which is just as large as the previous three. And this means that the concentration of the protein which is inside the feet will actually remain the same because we do not lose any liquids. However the components which are there's often the permeates will. Will permanently leave this is them in there for their concentration in the fin in the feet solution will slowly become lower. While they can describe this with the with a difference equation. Which gives the amount of these old components which leave the system for the permeate. As a function of time. And but basically if we keep to permeate flow constants of the system. Then the amounts to the amounts of. Components which. Which are dissolved in the permeate is the amount stuff that we lose in time. So if we if we dissolve this differential equation. Then we find the concentration of these small molecular weight components. As a function of time. And you see that there's an exponential decay. So the longer we do this operation. The lower the concentration of the souls and supers will be in the solution and therefore the pure the protein solution will become. So this is with that stifle tradition. Of course we can also do the same thing. In continuous modes. For larger applications. What we do here is. Once more we have the feet which we supply continuously we have the resin Tate's which we collect. Continuously. And we have the permeate. However now we also supply. What we call the die full trace in water. To the system which is just as large as the Permian flow. So that means that the feet flow is equal in size to direction they flow. So for example a protein which is retained by the member will look change its concentration it will remain at the same concentration. While those smaller components may be sugars. Or Scholtz will pass the membrane. And that when the Permian. Well if that's the case. We can easily find that the series of souls will simply distribute over the resin tape and permeates. So the more dire filtration Walter. We add. The more permeates. We obtain and the more we actually take out the small molecules and. We can easily express this once more as a function of the. Permeates recovery rate. And with that we can see that. If we increase the amount of Die filtration water and permeate. Then we see that the concentration of. This small molecular weight components which pasta membrane. Effect becomes larger and larger. The more water. We supply. So in this way we can actually reach a pure product because protein concentration has not changed. While the low molecular weight components. Will actually have reduced. In concentration. What we see both. It's a ferocious is in the way that. For example a way protein isolate is created. So here we converts. The way into a product which contains mostly protein. And which can be used for a variety of applications. Well for this we have to do two things. We have to remove the amount of water which is present in way. And we have to remove the. Low molecular weight substance like for example lactose. And salts. While the way is for special rights. Of course for food safety reasons. Then we get rid of most of the water so now we actually remove a lot of the water. So it is a concentration mode in continuous operation in this case. And then after these multiple places in step. We have a more concentrated solution. We first filter it a little bit to get rid of some some contaminants. And then we die a filter. Which means that we rinse out. The and the salts and at the end. We have been left with a concentrated solution. Of rather pure proteins. And this is an ideal to two. To dry so we do not have to remove too much water because we already concentrated it. And probably will be rather pure. Because we have also removed. The low molecular weight components. And therefore we can use for example spray drying to get the ultimate product. Well. To summarize. Whether you use reverses motors not a full trace an older filtration microphone tracing or other processes that all have to be applied in the specific configuration. And it depends on all the requirements of what type of configuration that you will use for smaller scale applications you typically would apply a batch. System. While for larger systems large factory you would typically used a continuous system. A concentration mode means that you actually reduce the volume. So you. Increase the concentration of the components that are retained by the membrane. Well the dye filtration configuration. Will reduce the volume but it will basically rinse out. The smaller components from the system and therefore will generate a cleaner products and wood and these two types of operations. With the different types of membranes. Will give you a lot of options to design. Factories to obtain pure products. For the food industry.",

                "text": "This LIVE will be about membrane technology in food engineering. More specifically. Micro full face in which becomes a more and more important process in for example brewing. Wine industries. And food U.S. industries micro filtration. Is basically the filtration of very small particles in the range of ten on a meters to ten micro meters. And therefore it's about clarification. Of liquids removal of particles. So that you only. Only have these off components left. It has the micro fish membranes have much larger portion. Relative to older filtration membranes. Difficult bore size will be around one hundred nanometers. At the focal module. Looks like this. For example. Dupes may be used which which are porous. Their feet will flow through these these tubes. And there will be a pressure difference off maybe much of the free bars. Over the membrane. The liquid will be filtered and the components which keep which which came past the course will then be collected on the outside of these of the of these tubes. The components which every danger will flush with the feet. Through the membrane. And will be collected at the end. Two types of membranes can be distinguished. All of polymeric membranes and ceramic membranes. The oldest ones are the polymeric membranes. And typically the helos acetate or membranes are used here. And they will have four sizes in the range of one to two micro meters. Other membranes which are used to lots in the food industry especially are ceramic membranes. Here. Very small. Well you can say particles of send are scenes of together. Such that they will add that that will form a porous network. And if you make holes through. Which is such a network you can actually push the feet. Through these holes. Then the liquids can permeate through the pores in the spores network. And be collected on the outside these ceramic membranes have to do is find is that they will have a lower flux than these polymeric membranes. However since they are ceramic materials. You can he did very easily. And you can also treat them with with quite aggressive chemicals and especially defending this tweet that's important because we need to to disinfect the membranes and make sure they're completely clean and hygienic. So therefore they're very popular in the food industry. At difficult unit looks like this. Once more we have the more the membrane modules here. The fetus can continuously through this membrane and it is also pumped continuously over the membrane in the research relation loop. While. The permeate is collected on the outside here. And once more that the proposal applications are for example in clarification of fruit juices. But also in the production of beer. And in the clarification of wines. However it's also used in the dairy industry. A lot. The mechanism. Is basically filtration. So liquids. Process through the pores of the membrane. While particles. Will be retained. These particles are relatively small. Once more in the range of a micro metre or show. But they will be taken up by the flow of the liquid which is over the membrane. And because these particles of course have a finite size they will then tumble over each other and the stumbling effect will cause a sort of fluid is ation effect. And will have the net result that the particles will not simply stick to the to the filter but will be taken up by the cross flow. So well this happens. As lower precious. However. You can also imagine that if. Too many particles will accumulate on the surface then at some point. The liquid is not sufficient anymore to take up all those particles. And then we will have a speck and layer which. Call a cake layer. And when. When that happens you will see the same effect as with ultra filtration that. We will have an area in which we will have a flux which is independent of the pressure. So if we increase the pressure. Then the cake layer on top of the member will simply become thinker. But it will not result in higher studies state flux. With Michael Tracey we see an extra effect however. As soon as you have such a cake layer and you would increase the pressure further. Then you will see that these particles which. Which form this K.K. will be pressed. More closely together. This will make it make the pores in between them so smaller. And therefore the permeability. Of of of this cake layer for permeation of water will become smaller and smaller. And therefore you will often see that. While at the beginning we will have this linear behavior. Then will have a limiting flux but very quickly. You will see a complexion which will actually reduce the pressure. Again. So if you go too far in pressure. Then in fact you will see the the. Deflection will start to decrease once more in the in the in the cake layer. Regime which is which is here. You can you can obtain the same information as with the older filtration. With the help of jelly or plots. You might remember with the older filtration that we typically sold out if we plots the concentration on the feed side of the membrane. In the longer logarithmic way. Against the flux. Then we will end up with a straight line. That's also the case with microphone for example. And under these conditions we see that this line will predicts that there is a gel layer concentration or. Take their concentration of this value of a round stent to the fifth ppm and the slope will tell us the must transfer Co fish and. Of course if we increase the velocity. The crew flow velocity over the membrane. You will see down the slope of this line will start to reduce. So the line will actually rotates to the left. And that's because the Muslims for coefficient. Will actually decrease. If you go down across low velocity. Of course in a jelly or concentration to take their calls and station will remain constant. And once more we can use these these boats. To find the must transfer coefficient and. The cake layer concentration. So basically if you operate here. You will have a low flux. And in fact it will follow the membrane heavily. If we operate here. Obviously. Then we will have a very low flexion there for that's not Ultimo as well. And therefore people typically say that this is the optimal. Area. For operation. So if. If he would operate here we would actually follow the membrane. But we should here. Be be here just before the actually starts to form and that's called. The critical flex concept that we have a flux. Where we just have no. Falling off of the membrane. Because fouling is the is the most critical problem. In microfilter patient in general in membrane technology but especially in microphone tracing. You see here a membrane which is which we has been used and. It has become heavily fall for example here you see several cells. But also other components which is here to the membrane and which are then very difficult to remove. Typically what people do is. Is that you can actually optimize the flux by reversing the flux after some time. So if he starts to operate. Then the flux is high. But very soon the membrane will be started to will start to become filed. And at some point you simply simply reverts. The flux so you actually press. The liquid from the Permian side through the feet side which lifts off. Part of the falling from the membrane and therefore the flex will go up. Of course if you don't start with with normal operation. You will once more accumulate particles. Until you. Once more reverse the pressure difference over the membrane you lift off the. The following components etc. So that helps. Is Called back Bill sing or. Back flushing. But after some time you still see that the flourish. Will start to deteriorate. After some time. And therefore after several hours of operation you really have to clean the membrane fairly and that is where. Ceramic membranes shine you can really clean them. Very well. So for across the membrane and microphone. We see that it's very important process. It is used in a clarification of various systems like for example wines and beers and food uses the modules are typically. Tubular. Very often they are ceramic but also polymeric membranes. Are used. It is a process. Of saving. So the typical pore size is between point one and ten micro meters. And we simply see evolve the smallest particles. We typically want to operate in the critical flux regime which is just below. The moments that we will see. Falling in the membranes if we go lower we have a too low flux. If we go higher. We will have a deteriorating falling off the membrane. But if we are in this regime. This process is very efficient. And can replace many. Classical filtration processes.",

                "text": "This clip will be about membrane the guillotine food engineering and more specifically. Ultra full facial. Which is perhaps the most important membrane. Process. In the food industry. Both of alteration. Has typically Bourse which is in the range of one that a meter which allows the separation of. Micro molecules like proteins and larger carbohydrates from smaller components. Therefore it's positioned to the right. Of reverses Motors and then a full to ration. And membranes which have very small bourse and which allow only deposits of water or very small molecules. There for all to filtration is aimed at the separation of micro molecules. It is used. Very much. For example for separating proteins. Out of out of. Out of way so in the dairy industry it's really important. But it's also useful lots. In the downstream processing. Of fermentation process is for example in the production of enzymes. If you think about the separation of potatoes. Into starch and proteins and other components. Those are filtration is used to separate proteins. From the potato juice. And for example it's also used in the regeneration off the brine which is used in cheese production. Cultivation membranes are typically produced in the form of tubes. But these to smite may be so small that they're also called Keplerian then that the pickle diameter is something like three millimeters. While the typical dimension of a tube is something like a centimeter or so and one housing there will be several of these tubes and ones which are housing will then be connected by other. Other tubes to to the next housing so sure in fact there's old There's a lot of membranes. Which are placed in parallel. To give enough. Surface area. The reason that you can not use spiral ones. Membranes. Here is because the solutions contain proteins and other following components and. Let's heat spiral want more you will be completely blocked off sometime because of this of these components. Typically they look like this for example. Defeats flow from. From this side. To the other side. There will be pressure from the inside to the outside and therefore. Walter and. Small a moment Hughes will emerge from the other sites and. Will be collected. At the outside of the module. And this is how the modules. Are done. Arranged into a larger system. In a typical automatic pressure difference over the membrane is mold that Larch. Of course we retain proteins for example but it's. The smaller molecules like souls and sugars are actually passing through the membranes and it means that the concentration. The tween the. Feet and the permeate side there's not that large. Therefore the typical of small to pressure difference will be in the range of. Maybe half a bar. Maybe one bar or so and that means that we do not have to overcome very large or small to pressure differences and therefore the pressure over the membrane. Is typically in the range of six seven bars. So the pressures are much lower than with reverse osmosis. And then the filtration. Membranes and that's also because remember this. Well contains larger portion there for their opener. And do not require such a high pressure difference. Important is that the size of the. Force in the membrane will determine which components will be retained by the membranes and which which will will last and for this we use the molecular weights could of curve. What you see here is the retention. That the membrane gives as a function of the molecular weight. Of the components in solution. Which are offered. So if we for example. This all of a small components in India feed something like ten kilos dealt with so ten thousand grams from all this membrane. Will. Will the lives of most of the components possibly the retention is very close to zero. However if we take a big molecule like for example fifty five or sixty. Killer Delta also sixty thousand grams from all. These components will be completely retained by the membrane. In between these two extremes you will see that the retention slowly decreases with a lower molecular weight. And therefore for example at around thirty to forty five people dealt on the retention will be somewhere like fifty percent. Typically people call the retention of a membrane. The value. At which the retention. Is ninety percent or so for this membrane that will be something like fifty three kilo Delton. However you should realize that the retention is never. Always completely one hundred percent. It's also never really. Zero percent but it usually somewhere in between. And that's important to take into account. The mechanism. At which it is member and works is basically seizing once more we have a very porous layer. A rather thick layer which only gives the membrane. Mechanical strength. And on top of this membrane will be a very thin layer which contains the actual small Bourse which gives the separation. So if we enlarge this area. We see this. We see a thin layer. Maybe with a thickness of on my commute or show. Which contains spores in the range of one nanometer proteins. Have a similar size maybe a bit larger and therefore. Many of them will be retained. And there will not be able to enter these portion. Of course the water and the small molecules can simply pass through the membrane. And therefore we get to this separation so the principle is basically exclusion. However there is one important. Effect. That's we get and that is that these compounds which are retained. Will accumulate before the membrane. And that means that we will have a layer which. In which we will have a very high concentrations of for example these proteins and the what are the. Solution which positive membrane has to pass through this concentrated layer. And it's called concentration polarization. And we typically need to apply a larger pressure to make sure that water will actually pass this. This layer. Well we can describe this as a diffusion process. And for this we use our fundamental. Flux equation. Which gives the flux of the solution. Through the membrane. As a function of the driving force. Through this. Concentration polarization layer. Times that if you should go fissions. And this diffusion go fishing between water which moves. And the components. The proteins which are stagnant here which which are captured here. Times the total concentration of the total number of multiple cubic metre divided by. The concentration of these digitals COM components and there for one minus. The mother fraction of water. Of the mill effect of water is given here. But that's basically the motor fraction of the dissolved components. Well. If we assume that the activity is equal to the activity coefficient. Times the mall or motor fraction. We can write it like this and. The rivet if of the logarithm of course this is one over the arguments times to the rigor. Derivative of the arguments. If we know assume that the. Activity coefficient is. Is Constance then we can actually discard. This activity coefficient. And if we don't rearrange differently we end up with the equation for the velocity at. At which water will pass through this concentration polarization. Is equal to the. Diffusion coefficient. Times. The total motor concentration. Divided by the concentration of the dissolved components in this concentration polarization layer times the gradients. Of the of. The of the of the concentration of the components in this in this layer. Well we can actually. Used this. And now start to integrate this formula. We do this by separating differ I've also the fusion coefficient. And the concentration we bring to the other sites like this. They're here. And also. This does that we bring to the other side and the and the. Gradients in the concentration we keep on the side. Well if we know integrated. From here to there because that's. That's where the diffusion limitation is. We end up with an equation which gives the concentration from here to there. As a function of the total. Flux that the total philosophy of the water passing through this concentration polarization layer and the mass transfer of cold fission which is equal to the diffusion coefficient. The fight it by the thickness of this layer. This is really important because if we increase the pressure over the membrane the flux will become higher. And therefore if the flux becomes higher you see that the concentration. Here on the interface of this concentration of these old components on the interface. Will start to rise and you can see that if we write this equation slightly different. First of all we say that the ratio of the of the molar freshens form from here to there is more or less equal to the ratio of the concentrations. And then if we rewrite this if we take this to the power. Then we find that the concentration on the surface of the membrane. Is equal to the concentration. In the boke of the of the feet side. Times. Each to the power of the flux. Through the membrane divided by. The must on for a cold fish and so the larger the flux becomes the larger the concentration in the membrane will become. And basically that means that if we increase the flux. This concentration on the membrane will increase and increase and increase. And at some point it may become so high that. For example this protein will not be soluble anymore. So then this concentration. Will actually become so high. That's the protein will start to precipitates on top of the membrane. And this is called Jelly or formation. So we started with the situation we first have a rather relatively low flux. Which means that this Crohn's inflation will be elevated but still. OK. And then if we increase the flux. Then at some point. This concentration will be so high that we will have precipitation on the membrane. And whenever we now increase the pressure further. You will see that this concentration cannot increase any more because it was simply induced more precipitation. So an increase in pressure will only result in a thinker. Gel or and therefore. Increasing a pressure. Will not result in a higher flux but it will only result in a thicker jelly or concentration. Well since we have this. Fundamental relation. It also means that the flux that we have in. Steady State is dictated by this only ability. Of this protein. If the salinity is very high we can have a large. Flux over the membrane. If it's low if the gel layer concentration is low. Then also our flux will be relatively low. While we can see this in the graph which gives the flux as a function of the pressure. As soon as the concentration order. Order to flex with remembered is relatively high we will have this phenomenon. And we will have this gem layer this precipitated gel a are on the membrane. Of course if we have a very low pressure. Then the concentration of the member in this still very low and. A larger pressure difference. Over the member will simply result in the larger flux. But the soon as we increase the pressure more and more at some point we will have achieved. This precipitation concentration this gel concentration on the membrane. And from that time. The flux through the membrane is not dependent on the trans member and pressure any more. And this is called a gel layer. Operation. Well you can see here. That this is. This depends on the call. Inflation in the gel it depends on the concentration that we offer. To the membrane but it's also dependent on the monstrance for a coefficient. So what we can do actually is to increase the must transfer Co for him by having a larger cross flow. If we have a larger profile you know that's a. That's the typical. Boundary layer becomes thinner. And since the mouse transfer coefficient is the diffusion coefficient divided by the thickness of this layer. We will end that with a larger must transfer coefficient So what you can do is. If you're in this regime. Pressure increasing. Makes no sense. But what you can do is to have a larger cross flow which will then result in the larger flux through the membrane. Well since we have this relation. If we operate in this area. We can actually obtain a lot of information about this region. By putting the values a little bit differently. If we offer. Difference. Feed solutions to a membrane. And then look at the typical flux that we obtain. You will see that the higher the concentration we offer in the boke. The lower the flux will be and. Developmentally if this conversation would be equal to the gel concentration to flex would be zero. But of course. A solution. With a gel. Concentration will be a gel itself so that small physically possible. However even at lower concentration you will see that this flux. Will be lower. If we offer a lower bulk concentration. If we know plus the horizontal axis. On the longer is a look at logarithmic scale. So that is to see as both. And we felt the flux linearly. We got the straight line. So by doing this by offering several different feed concentrations. And then. Plotting the flux. We can actually find first for the gel layer concentration which used to schools and tracing. And secondly this slope. Will Tell is. The mouse transfer coefficient. So by simply doing these few experiments. We find all the information that. We need to be able to design the process in the correct way. As a summary of filtration. Is a procedure which is used a lot for example in the dairy industry but also in quite a number of other industries. To separate larger molecules like proteins. From from from from a stream of. Smaller molecules. Well relatively low pressures like for example five six Marsh. The pressure pressure difference between feet. And permeate is actually quite low. And there's not to post any problem. However concentration polarisation this posed a problem. Most commercial ultra filtration systems operates in the in the jelly or modes. But. Fortunately we can get a lot of information about this this operation. With the use of. Of gel plants. And with that we can design the system in the correct way.",

                "text": "This clip will be about membrane technology and food engineering and especially about reverse osmosis and then a full tracing. These two processes are. The processes which. Which separated the smallest molecules. From a specific stream for example. Food stream like for example in their East Timor a food use. And reverse osmosis separates the smallest molecules which use that water molecules out of it it is a process which is which is driven by a pressure gradient. Basically. There is a very thin layer of a pull Americ material. And over this layer. We apply a pressure difference of typically one hundred bars or salt. We do this by a pressure pump. Through which defeat. Is fed. And then we actually apply across flow. Over the membrane with a larger pump. But that doesn't require a very high pressure difference. To ensure that every material which is retained by the membrane. Will be taken up by the cross flow. And the end. The resin type will to build will take of those materials which. Which are not passed through the membrane. While the permeate. In reverse osmosis mostly. Mostly water. Will leave. A module from the down side as I said. We typically use high pressures of. Fifty to one hundred twenty bars and. The cross low velocity is much larger than the feed flow velocity and also. Then the permeate flow velocity. Difficult applications. In the food area are for example the prequels and tracing of fluids because the member in this so thin only. Water molecules can penetrate the membrane there for all the other components like flavors but also sugars and. Proteins will be retained there for it's ideal for concentration off. Streams like milk fruits and vegetable juices. It's also used for. Alcohol is a human of beer and wine. Concentration of extracts like for example in the production of gelatin. And it's also. Extensively used in water treatment for example. Three pounds of water which is then used for brewing beer. The members itself. Is rather complex structure it basically consists of a thicker layer of approximately. Well appointed ones too many way to think. Which only. Is there to prove fight. Mechanical strength through the membrane it's just a mechanical barrier of the actual membrane which is actually in the fin. This is a dense layer with a thickness off around zero point one two one nanometer. And this is actually the membrane which which. Which gives to separation. The pores in these layers. Are so small that. They're only. Large enough to permit. The passage of water molecules where all the other molecules like souls or sugars are too big to pass. So therefore if we apply a pressure. That only the water molecules come past and we basically get a concentration of the stream that we offer to the membrane. We typically need a large membrane surface area. Because of the amount of water that we can send through the member and per square meter is. Is limited. Therefore we usually take. Flat sheet membranes which are the rolled up in the form. Over what we call the spiral wound module. Basically in such a spiral one module. The membrane is folded over a soda. So the feet can pass through the membrane and the. Permeates is collected on the other side. And then at the end if it's rolled up you get such a card to each. Which is then used in the larger machine to put the pressure on. There are some applications where we're also. To Miller membranes are used and then usually the feed is on the inside of these tubes. This is how these looks like this is a spiral ones module and. You should see that. That these spiral modules are placed off each other in this big steel tube. And of course the big steel tube is needed to withstand these very high pressures or something like. And bars. Let's have a look at what actually happens when we operates this process. So this is a schematic. Picture of a reverse osmosis member and this is the active layer for this very thin layer on top of the membrane. This is the Feed site. And this is the Permian side. So here we have a high pressure and here we have a low pressure. And typically what happens is that water. Components rates. Through this layer while the other components can build. That means that the concentration of water is higher here. This is higher here than there. And that's because there are other. There's old components there which of course also have a concentration. Well. We can have a look at what the driving forces in this system. This driving force is equal to the chemical potential. Of the off the water present here. Meant that with the with air pressure term. So that's the molar volume. Times. The pressure of this of these fluids and the same Also on the Permian side. And also here you see the chemical potential. With the water activity and. The pressure term. And of course the pressure on the downstream side these much lower. The difference in this. In this potential from here to there gives the driving force for appreciation. Let's have a look at how how we can be rife. The typical drive to the real driving force in this process. So we starts with these two. Potentials. And if we take the difference of them and of course we first have to take the one of the downstream side and then. The one of the. Of the feed side. And if we take the difference of the potential and divided by the thickness of the membrane. We will obtain the driving force. Or if we fill fill these in we basically obtain the difference in philosophy. Between the water molecules spazzing through the membrane. And the actual membrane itself. And if we do this division we find that. We see two terms. This term. Re presents the difference in a fifty between the feet and the red and and the Permian side and. I have this term. Which represents the driving force. Because of the pressure LIVE FROM so that we apply. You also see here the diffusion coefficient of course if the water molecules will be fused easily. Through the membrane. Then. Also the philosophy of the of these water molecules will be large and of course. If it's a very tight membrane with very local but a very very low mobility of the water molecules. This will still be slow. Well we can actually convert these philosophies into a flux. And then we obtain this relation. Which is the same relation but no translate to towards the amount of water per square meter per second which passes through the membrane. And we obtain the relation. Which ones more give this relation. For the difference in water activity and. The water activity here on the. Downstream side is higher than the water activity. On the Feed site. Simply because the concentration of water is higher here. And here we have to. Pressure difference. And we have to translate this to a driving force and therefore we have these this. These smaller volume divided by by our teeth. The value of. M. which is the partition coefficient times a different. Diffusion coefficient divided by the thickness of the membrane. Is also called the membrane. Permeability. Well I told you that there are two driving forces. One is the difference in water activity. And one is because of the pressure difference of the membrane. The well the activity here. Is higher than there. And that means that in fact. This driving force. Points from. Rights to left. While this driving force is the one that we apply. And in fact it points. From left to right. Because of course we want to have a flux. From left to right. But it means that this driving force actually points by courts and its counter acts are driving force for Permeation. You can also imagine that at some point if we adjust the pressure difference. That these two driving forces will become the. Game. So we have a certain pressure. At which this. Difference in what the activity gives you give the same driving force as a depression difference. For us. And that's called a small tic equilibrium. It happens when this term. This complete term. Will be zero. And then these two are exactly the of. The same size. Well this is called pressure difference. Basically if we want more take this potential from one side and from the other side. And take once more into the term for the activity. And for the pressure difference. And we say that this total potential should be equal in both sides we ended with this relation which has no longer rhythm of the ratio of the what activities should be equal to the difference in pressure applied over this. System. Times to Moeller multi-volume. If I did by our teeth. And that's the pressure. At which the tendency for the wall to move from left to right. Because it wants to be in the presence of other these old components. Is just compensated by a hydrostatic pressure difference. And that's important because we first have to overcome this pressure difference before we can push. Even more water out of this solution. And have reverses motion. So therefore this pressure difference is called Still small to pressure difference between the resin Tate's and the permit. If you look at the typical multi pressure difference between Walter and. A specific food stepsons substance we see differences for example milk. Typically has a little more pressure off. Six hundred ninety kilo Pasco or six point nine bars. While For example orange juice. Has something like sixteen bars. Of pressure difference which is quite a lot. And that means that you actually have to apply a large. Pressure difference of the membrane. To overcome these automatic pressure. Values. Basically. Reverse Osmosis is a process where we can separate really small molecules from from a saw. So therefore it is you for water purification or. For a concentration process especially in the food industry. It uses a pressure difference. And is important as a deflection equation. Can. Well it's it has a larger form but we can also simply fired by a value. Which used to prove me ability of the membrane. Times. The driving force and that's to pressure difference. Minus the a small tick pressure difference over the membrane. Because we first have first have to overcome. This pressure difference before we can have any flux of water from the concentrated stew to to dilute that side. So therefore. The process is hindered by just a small to pressure difference. And therefore built up be. The pressure difference that we apply has to be much larger than the pressure difference. Nonna filtration is a similar process. However it has slightly larger portion in the membrane. And that means that it will also. Permit. The passage shelf slightly larger molecules like for example small super molecules or. Mono fail insults. This set of of the proces effect is actually the same but typically the pressure differences that we apply. Are smaller. Typically in the range between ten and thirty bars. It's used to lots. In the food industry for example for the demon the realisation of weight. But also in the separation of. Sunflower oil from solvent sort of stuff and Korea's application. But also in the sugar industry. It is used in the downstream processing of from and patients. But also separation of mono failand ions from. Multivalent ions. Like for example calcium and magnesium. So it's an important process. The units which should supply fluke. Look quite similar to those for. Reverse osmosis. Only difficult pressures are lower in the range of thirty fifty Barstow to thirty Barsh a major difference with reverse osmosis is that while in reverses mode is usually the retention is almost complete. So that means that only Walter process with a membrane. In one of filtration we see that the retention infected. Usually lower. And. Well the retention basically is the difference in concentration over the membrane so here's a high concentration there's a low concentration. Be vital. By the concentration. The upper side of the membrane. So when there is no diesel components anymore in the done stream size that means that the retention is one or one hundred percent. And if the membrane process. Everything. Then the retention will be zero. Well with none of filtration the typical retention will be. Between ten and eighty percent. But at the pickle membrane will have something like sixty seventy percent of every tension while for a roof or a reverse osmosis membrane. The typical retentions. Should be higher than ninety eight percent. So to summarise. Reverse reverses motion and then the filtration processes are very important also are becoming more important in the food industry reverse osmosis mostly for dehydration Faucheux to concentrate for example. While. None of filtration. Also permits the passage of small molecule sing. Can therefore also be used for separating molecules from each other you will see that both processes will become more important in the future because they are very energy intensive and therefore they will probably replace older processes like evaporation.",

                "text": "Hi welcome to a new course. This course is called integration of evidence. One. Because at the end of the curriculum. You have a course called integration. Of evidence through. And I will introduce you to discourse. What are we going to do. In this course. Well. In discourse. You are looking for the truth. And let's take milk. As an example. This milk. Healthy for you or not. Some people say. Drink more milk. And they list. All kind of benefits. But all the people say the most dangerous thing to do is Rincon milk. How do you trust. Well. Maybe small swap is not that trustworthy. But the question is a serious question is milk healthy for you or not and there are many of this kind of questions. If the consumption of a certain foods. Good for you or not a lot of debate is going on. But how are you going to solve this question. How are we in science. Solving these questions. Or maybe not solving. But. Approaching these questions. For example. Look at though. A randomized controlled trial. Well maybe you will do a cohort study or. Animal experiments. Or maybe. Case control studies. Or even some light experiments. A lot of different options in science. And how to make the whole picture complete do so everything. All the results. Doing nicely fifty or maybe some resorts. Don't stick in the. Complete person. We have some kind of conflicts. How are you going to solve this conflicts. Bill. That's what are you going to do in discourse. You are WAY. Strength of evidence from. All kind of different studies. That Fortis. We have a so-called evidence parents. Studies at the top. Are supposed to get stronger evidence for that Shashi ation between food and health I was going for that study at the bottom. But this is the main topic of discourse. And what you are going to do. Is So look at the randomized control trials. Why are these. As a top. Is the really true that they are. At the top. And all the thing you're going to do is look into a professional studies. Epidemiological. Observational studies. And you will analyze the refills. And for that. You will refreshed and. Elaborates on your knowledge from previous courses. You will learn more about effect mesh if there's a reported in observational studies. You all are more about the study decides. That's what's reading you. In this course. Is that you're going to do the statistical analysis. Statistical test to see if there is a significance. Relation between Health's. Intake of foods. And health outcomes and your hands. And the data analysis. You're going to do in a statistical program called. Goals are. But the main topic. Is weighing the strength of evidence. And you look at several examples. To learn how to do this. So how's the schedule of this course. Here you see. Different topics that are in our curriculum. And this course. Focus on the relation. Intake. And health. In the first week. You start with a case on milk and bone health. This is the evil deal that some clips and so my readings. And the purpose of this case. Is to learn how to integrate evidence from all kinds of different studies. So you really will experience conflicting results. And think about how to solve it. You will go to say. In the groups or. Group assignments. You will look. To and all the topic. To fight I mean ask the premeditation and tell sort matelote and in a group. You will discuss whether there is evidence. For the relation between fire to mean a Superman's. And sheltered mentality. In their immobile. You will be guided step by step. During the more you will. And here in your course in your group. Work you have more freedom. And you go. Behave as a group. As a battle that has to get strength of scientific evidence. In the second week. We will look at random our school. Trial. If there's really. The so-called gold standards. Study design is it true that the randomized control trial. Is at the top of the pyramids. And in the third week. You are going to look. To observational studies. And the statistical analysis. Another thing in this course. Is that you will start. A larger project. You will. At the end of the program. At the end. In the course. Integration of evidence through. You need to write a position paper. About a certain health topic. And in this course. You will start this collecting information for this paper. You will select your topic. And then in each course of the curriculum. You will over work on this assignment. And you will finesse it's. At the end. Almost two years. And of course. At the end. We have to course XOM this if you. A short introduction to this new course. Integration of evidence. Details instructions will of course provide it's. Once you start with. It's activity.

                "text": "Welcome. So this clip. About information bias. Information bias is an important concept. In epidemiological studies. And I will explain information by is using an example. Coffee consumption and there as she did blood pressure. This is what you want to know. And your study bulb. Operation. Lets you observe this as your population for another service. And if you talk about dietary intake. Most of the time. We have errors in the assessment of this indeed. And also our health outcomes are sometimes. Assessed without a wish. So what we see in the population for analysis is a blood fission. And the question is with this blurred fish fish and in a population for analysis. Is to as you are looking through this that's as true as she can from the source population. Or if this is biased because of Paresh in art of the exposure already outcome. That's the big question. And if there are errors in the exposure and I would call that effect as efficient. So that as a shaking is no longer felt it. We thought about. Information bias. First I want to tell you a little more about some important. Therms. You will see. If you have read literature. About errors. In continuous variables are still done sometimes called. Measurements errors. And they are defined as right at random and systematic. And this is explained to this discussion to fifty years and you will find these figures in all kinds of epidemiological textbooks. So you can look it up by yourself. If you have got. So. Variables in groups. High low or gender. Male female. Now we thought about. Misclassification persons can be aggressive farts in the wrong group. And these enter US sometimes called classification analysts are called the five big message light sensitivity and specificity. And this is also explain to most of the standards. They put in your vertical textbooks. So these terms. You will see. When you read about. Information error. Let's look us in a to one example. You want to notice between coffee consumption and blood pressure. And people with a high. Coffee consumption. As a lower risk of blood pressure a higher risk of blood pressure. So this is the truth. And your source population. Well that's what do you see in your. Population for analysis. Suppose we have a case control study. And we have people with high blood pressure and low blood blood pressure. And we ask them to recall their coffee consumption. But now suppose that all people are estimating the coffee consumption. So they report. A lower consumption. Then they truly have. Do you think. The association between coffee and blood pressure is affected. Is there a bias. No I don't think so because the difference between. Coffee consumption in the low blood pressure and high blood pressure group. Is still the same as the difference in your source population. So although driven underestimation the. Underestimation is the same in both groups. So that as a chef in between coffee consumption and blood pressure. It's not effect it's. So there is no information bias. And if the error is the same in both groups because it's normal differential. And right. But now look at a different situation. Suppose that only people with a high blood pressure. Are underestimating the coffee consumption. Do you think there is a bias. In this case. Yes I think there is a bias. Because only. These people with the high blood pressure. Are underestimating coffee consumption. In reality. Their coffee consumption. Is much bigger. And now you see no difference anymore. Between. The high and low blood pressure group. So to assure efficient meeting coffee consumption and blood pressure. Are not longer of sure after your study. So what you see is not the true. Association. So really it's a bias. And this bias. Is because the error in your intake. Is differential. It's different between high and low blood pressure groups. Error is only present in the high blood pressure group. Differential era. Now let's look to an example. A friend I'm at work. Again we have low and high coffee consumers. And here you see the number of people in each group. In a low blood pressure and the high blood pressure group now assume we have a random error. Means. That's. Let's say ten percent of your population is misclassified. So how will this stable. Look in your population for analysis. Well let's look for example. To this group. The high coffee consumption. Consumers with a high blood pressure. Free hundreds of people are in this group. But how many people will you observe in this group. If done persons. Is misclassified will. Thirty people. Of this group is classified as local few consumers. Instead of. High coffee cost. But then persons of low cost human error are misc less farts. That's how I go because you are so over all you know and up to one that's eighty three people in this category. And here you see. All fifty is to get are you going calculate them themself yourself. It's got to Goree was about as for here if in between coffee consumption and blood pressure you see here. If that's still true. Association. Think a good look through the figures. And compare D.C. If you can't be this wrong. And if you take a good look. You see that here. The high blood pressure. Group and the low blood pressure group. Are more looking the same with respect to coffee consumption. Some of the difference between low and high coffee called humors. Is gone. Because of this random error. So the association. Will be called weaker. Because of this random error. You Up sure if a vicar Association. So I'm bias. So far. We have a few examples of information bias. Sometimes you have an overestimation of the effect sometimes an underestimation. Or you have random errors. So another. Lot of different situation. You know with information bias can assure. And this they will summarize all difference. Situations we thought about errors in coffee consumption exposure. And these errors. I had to be random and systematic for continuous variables. But also forgot a coracle variables that can be random in a systematic. And again I did. The differential. One on differential. Differential. Means that air or in coffee consumption. Depends on the outgoing and non differential means that error in coffee consumption. Is the same for all people. And the big question is how do these errors. Influence your association. And unfortunately there are no rules. You can learn. There are no rules. Saying. If you have this error or. That the only. Biased. In the direction of the know. And if you have. This air order as a she will be biased. Order will be no bias. No forget about its. No general rules. I just show you a few examples. And that's today how you have to improve. Approach. Information bias. Think about what kind of advice that are and just use logic or reasoning. To understand how the exposure outcome is influenced. And logical reasoning. To see and think about is there a bias. And in what direction is this bias. So no general rules. And to make it more complicated. You can also have errors in your own school. For this example. And blood pressure and again. I love of different situations may you cue. No general rules keep thinking. So that's the main message. Of this clip. Think about information bias. Think about what kind of errors are presence. Either in your exposure. Or your outcome. Think about. Audience Arish differential. Or not and if they are differential. Test a ring a bell. Especially if you have different so and or so the errors. Are different for different groups. Information bias. Is very likely. But even if they are not difference you. Also information biases possible. So the main message this keep thinking. So this gives you a first introduction to information bias. And. I know that's in your future life. Our dresser professional epidemiologist. And even in your education. Information bias. Come back again and again because it is just an important topic in epidemiological studies.",

                "text": "Welcome to this clip about selection bias. Selection bias. Is one of. An important bias in epidemiological studies. And I will explain this bias in the content of an analytical study. And I'll think of study as an example on smoking and lung cancer. You study disassociation. Your source population. But most of the time. You are not able to study the whole source population. But this is not what you want to know what you are going to do in your study. Is that you select some people. Into your study population. The during your study. If you follow up. People that some subjects may drop out from the study. They are last to follow up. So what you observe. The relation between smoking and longer answer is that your population for analysis. And the big question is Is this what you see in the population for analysis. Is doesn't really have the truth is that really the true execution. In the source population. Or are they different. And if they are different. If I say you observe is not what. Truly is the case. Then we thought about a bias. And in this case. A selection bias. Because selection bias is the find. As all kind of biases that we silt from selecting people. Into the study or. Out of the study. A selection bias. Is a threat for. Into an awfully tittie let's look at an exam. To an example suppose stats smokers are lost to follow up. What do you think is the selection bias in this case. Is a question see. If that's the truths. Because of smokers. Some of the smokers are lost to follow up. No I don't think the so. There is a bias. Be. The smokers that are still in your study. Although there are less smokers in your study. But the smokers that. They're in the study still reflects the relation between Longer answer and smoking. Use washable place. So there is no bias. But now suppose. Those smokers drop outs. Because they have little complaints. In this case. Do you think that there is a bias. Do you think that's what you see. Is the true Association. Bill let's think about it if people drop out because of lung cancer complaints. They're shisha between longer smoking a longer answer. Will be called Meeker. So you observe of S. affiliation. Then the true Association. Only because of you have a select selective. Loss to follow up. And in this case. You have selection bias. The same can happen. If you select people. Into a study. Suppose. That's nonsmokers. Are more willingly. To participate in this study don't smoke than smokers. Ought to happen in this case. Well. Still those smokers. That are in the study. Although there are a lot less smokers in the study. They still reflect the S. or Chez Sheep between smoker smoking and lung cancer. In the source population so. No bias. But now suppose. That's the people that are going to need to comply and to apply to this study. Are only smokers. With a low risk of lung cancer. As smokers. With a high risk of longer answer for example smokers with a family history of longer answer. I'm not going to need to participate in the study. So if you have only smokers. With a low risk of lung cancer in the study. You observe a smaller Avika risk between smoking and lung cancer. That is truly the case. So in this case. We have a bias. Might have a note that selection bias. From enrollment procedures. Are not happen very often in cold hard studies. Because in cohort studies. You start with a healthy population. So this is of a SHE WILL NOT a cure. In cold hard studies. Because you don't know if people have. Long complaints already. That. The issue out. About family history. May still be an issue. But in case called case control studies. You may have selective dropouts. That's depends on the status. So then the risk of bias is present. Now explained. The issue of generalized ability. And this is a completely. All the issue. The selection bias. And I will explain it because you. Easily mix it up with selection bias. Generalized ability. Means that if you study for example. Men. The association between smoking and lung cancer in men. Then the big question is if this is sufficient. Also holds for woman. So for a bigger relation. A broader population. So are these three fields that you observe if only in men. Are generalizable to a broader population. So this has nothing to do with its selection bias. Because selection bias here. But the test to do with the extra Arnel for liberty of the study. Still has to do with selection of people. But not. What selection bias. So now you have a first introduction off. On selection bias. And a selection bias is a very important topic in a pretty realistic a study if you have to think about it very often. If you conduct your own studies. And if you've read studies of others. So I hope you have now a starting point. To start you thinking about selection bias good luck.",

                "text": "Hello In this clip. We're going to talk about. Dolly's which is short for disability adjusted live years. And perhaps you've seen some papers from the global burden of disease project which uses this dollies. And here we going to show you how you calculator. So the dolly stands for disability adjusted life yes. And it's also some sort of health adjusted like yours calculation. In this case it's the number of healthy years of life lost. So it's a get. Measure. Due to premature death and disability. So in that respect it's different from the Y L L. Years of life lost. So it measures the actual situation. Or at least it used to excell situation and compares it to a health target. Or norm. Let's say. Perfect Health at. Age of eighty years well. Who would reach that. Right. And this slide shows you how to calculate it. While you start at birth. And you are great meaning. Healthy. Your care. Some stage you have certain diseases which is the orange. Band. And that a certain age you get more disease it and at a certain age. You get a chronic disease. And then at a certain stage. You die before age eighty. For example. So you're expected to age. And as expected live years what it was eighty. And you had early Seth. And that part on the right hand side. Gives you two years of life lost. As we have seen before the while and then the while these. Is the years of lived with disability. And you simply counted. You can count. The years. Lived in disability so you add up all the orange bend. And there's also some part which you can wait. According to the severity of the disease. Which is then part of this of Y L D. Years lived with disability. So again the dolly consists of two parts. The years of life. Lost the while. And the while the the. Years of lived with disability. Now years of life lost again. There are simple to calculate you simply multiply the number of deaths in your population. With the life expectancy from a standard life they will actually date of death. Now to years lived with disability. Is this calculation. Y. multiplied by L.. Multiplied by the disability weight. So it's the number of. Incident cases in your population. Multiplied with the. Everett duration of the disease. Until remission or this. Multiplied with a disability weight. Depending on your disease or disability. You can also use an alternative calculation the prevalence. Because the intern and. Of the deceased multiplied with the duration. Is the same as the prevalence as you have seen an earlier. E.P. in your chicle. Clips. The disability weights it's an interesting phenomenon. You valuate. The non-fatal health outcomes. The disability or the quality of life associated with the disease. On a scale from zero to one. When you have a zero there is no loss of health. So you are perfectly healthy. When there is a one year debt. So that's the worst case scenario so to speak. And note that in the health. Adjusted. Life expectancy the calculation of this weight is the other way round. Now. The validation of this disability weight. Can happen by various groups. Often we use experts the doctors. But sometimes also patients are you or. The general public. And this may differ in the outcome. And actually some people argue that you shouldn't use the patients. Because they are at risk of underestimating their own disability. Because they have a chronic disease and got. Adapted. They got used to it. So in reality most often. The experts or general public. Panelists use. And what do they do then well that's a little bit difficult to explain. There's one man. Which is quite easy. And you just give the people a visual analogue a scale and I just have to put a mark on the scale from zero to one hundred. To evaluate or to value disease. But more refined methods are the three mentioned below. The person trade off. The time trade off. Or the standard gamble. And you talk to the people of the peno. And you say. Ask them as some sort of mental exercise in the first one a person trade off. The people have to imagine that they can extend the life of one thousand healthy. People for one year. And then they are asked about how many lives of people with a certain this sees. Should be extended with one year. In order to be equal to. This one thousand extra healthy life years. And when they say well. Five hundred nane know maybe six hundred eight hundred. So you titrate them you start with a simple one and you. Refine it. The same level of titration and the same questions are asked in the time. Trade off. But then the exact question is a little bit different. You value one life here with a specific disease. So the opportunity is offered to the people of the panel to trade. This year. One life here with a specific disease for a shorter period without the disease. And then the penalties are asked. How many years they are willing to sacrifice in order to have a life free of this disease and a final one and stand a gamble. The people in the Bennell have to imagine that they have a disease and that there is an operation a surgery which where there is a quite a risk of this simply curing the disease but also risk of dying from this surgery. And then they are. Asked how many risks of how much risk of dying they're willing to take for this trait. Of getting a chance of surviving or curing from this disease. This is called to stand the gamble. So in short you have quite You need quite some information to calculate this Dolly. And lucky they are available. Like in the global burden of disease project. So we need general data. On the demography of a population. The numbers by age and sex and to calculate the years of life lost we need data even article data on deceased specific mortality. Again. By age and sex firmly by sex. And also some age specific life expectancy the chosen norm for example. Eighty years. In health. To calculate two years lived with disability. We also need. Information on the prevalence of disease or. Internet and ration of the disease. As well as the health status fellow race in the disability weight. So all this information is news to calculate the dollies. And actually we're not going to talk about this now but the similar way is used to calculate the qualities. We come back to that in another clip. This isn't a simple example let's say we have a population of three persons. Very very small population. And our target norm is living. Until eighty. Now we have one person who died from a traffic accident. At age twenty. We have one person died at age fifty one of story died at age eighty. But had a trite is on age fifty. And one person the third person. Having diabetes at age thirty. And dying at age sixty two years of life lost in this case are quite simple. Because eighty is the norm. And this person dies at age twenty. So the difference is sixty years lived with disability is zero because this person. Wasn't sick he just died from a traffic accident. So the total dollars for this person is sixty plus zero. Is sixty. This person develops. Room. Were much like. Rheumatoid arthritis at age fifty and dies at age eighty eight eighty was our norm so years of life lost is Ciro. But this person had a trite is so. Multiplying this thirty years with a decease. Times. Say a half. For this disease. I know this disease has a disability weight of a half. Gives us. Fish. A years. Of live with disability. And the total Dolly dead is fifty. The final person dies at age sixty so years of life lost is eighty minus sixty is twenty. And the disability weight for diabetes is a little bit lower. Or point two. So while the is thirty melt applied by zero point two is six which gives a dolly. Or twenty six. So in his total. Very very small population. The total number of dollars is one hundred one. So in summary. This clip you have learned about the dolly. And how to calculate it. And also how you come to a disability weight. And think about it is not an easy thing.",

                "text": "Hello. This is another clip in the series on summary measures of population health. Freddy relevant for public health. The topic is healthy adjusted. Life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. And they sound the same but they are not the same and that's what I'm going to explain now. So in your previous clips we looked at quantity of life the life expectancy mortality rates etc. So what's the quantity what comes what quality of course quality of life is also important. And in this group are going to discuss how you can include. Morbidity and life expectancy together or how to combine mobility with years of life lost. They get better. Let's think about the survival curve again. We start at age. Zero. Until. In this case one hundred ten ten. And we start. Start with one hundred percent of the population. Alive. And you see it a survival curve a slight decline in mortality which starts increasing the mortality rate. At all that age. So the total area under the curve is the life expectancy. Now you can also think about healthy life expectancy and how to calculate this. And take for example someone from fifty years is still alive. That's the dog Blue Line. But part of this life. Is not completely healthy. Part was unhealthy. So in this stage you can say part of this is unhealthy life expectancy a part of this is healthy life expectancy. So we can notice for all age groups. And then we have this. Curve. The like blue curve. Which is the life expectancy. In good health. Indicating that area. And this one the darker blue area. Indicates the total life expectancy in poor health. How you calculate this well you saw the survival curve so you can imagine we use the old famous life table again. And we do it in a similar way as we did before for total life expectancy. At least in the beginning. We take the age group that's. Age Group Zero. And we start. And we think that. In the one year of life the first year of life we have disappeared tella the risk. So when we start with one thousand. That say babies. Boys and Girls. We estimate based on this mortality risk. That nine hundred thirty nine. Will die in the first year of life. In the first year interval. This means that the total years lived. Of this group of one thousand babies. Is ninety nine thousand five hundred thirty one namely one hundred thousand minus Hopf. This number of the ceased remember we assume that they die half way to year because we are not sure what. To period of this year they will be deceased we take on average six months living. For those who are deceased. But that one extra thing is that we now know in these babies ninety five percent are healthy. That's assumed. So done the healthy years lived on ninety five percent of this. Total years lived in this case. Ninety four thousand five hundred fifty four. And then we have the same format as for the total life table. We have to calculate this for every year until the last person dies in this court for example age one hundred and we don't can calculate for each interval the total healthy. Years lived for this cohort let's say it is called Born in this age. Starting at age three or zero. And then. Like with total. Life expectancy. We just divide this total healthy years. By the number of persons which lived in this period. And this needs. This healthy lives. Period. Or in this case we divided the healthy life expectancy the total healthy. Years divided by the people alive to get the healthy life expectancy. Looking at this graph you see the light blue. The healthy life expectancy. And the dark blue. The life expectancy in poor health. In some. This is the total life. Expectancy. Now you question the self. What is health. Well there are many different missions of help. And many forms of health expectancies. So what you see in literature can be life expectancy without disability. Without a chronic disease. In good perceived health. Without dementia. And there are many many more around. Now we have to realize. You know that. Health is not black and white situation. And we can also include. Measurement of severe Riki for example. Life expectancy with severe disability. Moderate disability. Like disability or even without disability. So this is one way to include severity in your calculation. But there's also another way. We can make one single measure that takes a favorite into account. It's what we call the health adjusted life expectancy. And this consists of two parts. The healthy years and. Part of the unhealthy years. And this part. Is a part. Which is waiting this. Unhealthy years. According to some sort of factor. The disability weight. For example if you have a severe disability. This year count as hard as a year of a healthy person. So this slide shows you the relationship between all the things we have been talking about life expectancy. Healthy life expectancy and healthy. Adjusted life expectancy. We see here on the left. The healthy life expectancy in light blue. The total life expectancy and. The life expectancy in poor health which we now subdivided in various forms of for example disability. And on the right hand side you see the health adjusted. Life expectancy. It consists of the healthy life expectancy and. Part of this. Poor health which is done weighted. According to the different weights we give to the different classes of disability. So you see that the hate the hail the health adjusted life expectancy. Always falls in between. Life expectancy. And healthy life expectancy death by definition. So in this clip. You have learned about healthy life expectancy health adjusted life expectancy and how to calculate them.",

                "text": "And this knowledge clip I will introduce the concept of. Dr fractionation traffics nation can be used to alter the composition of. Plant materials. Most classical example Dr fractionation is the wheat. Mill and process. Which I will cover. At the end of this knowledge clip. Then the tears can act as a sort for. As a source for a broad range of ingredients. As can be seen in the table. Depending on the actual crop. They contain. Different types of ingredients. However for many applications. You would like to have different compositions for example. More protein. Or more Phylis This is however a dilemma. If you would like to have a very high purity. Then normally the yield goes down. So there's a dilemma between yield. And purity. But still more the food processors. Focuses on the use of. Pure ingredients. What do we do. Here is a planned cereal. We decompose it completely. Into pure. Ingredients. Protein isolate. Oil. Carbohydrates. In case of soy. And then we make a product. Reconstituting the deciding greediness. From the pure ingredients. Remembering the yield proof purity dilemma. This is clearly not very efficient. Not only that. The separation process itself. Is a quite harsh process. Here is a production process. Of soy protein isolate. How does it work. Soybeans. A milk. Then the fatted. Using an organic solvent. Then we use ph which. To remove the carbohydrates and. Finally we dry. The protein solution. The consequence is on product proper protein properties are quite large. BRODIE. Can partly nature is only partially Native. Anymore. Due to the dissolution of precipitation. And the effect of drying and heat. For many applications. By the way. We only would like to remove the carbohydrates. And maybe Fed is not always necessary. So you can question yourself whether. Complete purification. Is always necessary. It's understandable what people do it because it's very convenient. Well defined stable ingredients. Quality control. Always the same quality. For. After a certain process and. For supply chain management. It's also handy to have constant quality. When you have too many such a supply chain. But hardly any food products. Consist of one single pure. Ingredient. And secondly there might also be structures present. Inside materials which can be relevant for the food. Applications. They might possess interesting properties. And that's why dry fractionation can be very interesting. You make use of material properties. Here we see a schematic picture of the seed for example. And you see there is some structure organization within the seeds. And suppose you would break such a seed in elements having those structural elements. And the other one having this component. And then you separate those two. Maybe you can have a certain extent of purification. Or certain extent of. Fractionation. So it takes. I just saw it appear corner all the materials milling to suit a classification process. For example in size and then City. Are using. There are seeds. Then you can get two types of fractions. Or if more. High protein fraction. And a low protein fraction. Yes fans are just a dry fractionation if you don't use water. And you don't need. Drying or all the stabilization process. After the fractionation. So overall less heat in the drying. Dry fractionation the milling. And this separation process. Is also easily scalable. We have to realize that computer components are not pure. But only enriched. Of many applications. This might be sufficient for some appreciations though. It might be insufficient and then what fractionation is really necessary. If you do. Drive fractionation you focus on functionality. Rather than purity. Now how does such a process normally look like. It is a combination of milling process. And a process. To separate often classification. If you have a powder. You Millet's. You get particles with different properties. If you blow air in it. The fine particles will go up. And the dense particles. Will fall down. And you can separate them again. If necessary mill them again. Etc etc. So dry fractionation is normally a process. Consisting of a range of merely equipment and methods. To separate the various structures. One crop which is very suitable for dry fractionation. Is the crop. And you see here. Someone working. In practice with an air classification. Equivalent. The P.. Can be milled such that we obtain a starch. Rich. Fraction. And we created here. And a protein and richest fraction. And you can clearly see the differences in structure. Between those two fractions. And the properties differ sufficiently. So we can easily separate them. Using density or size differences. The person working here is a Ph D. student Pascola still home. And she was able to obtain a protein concentration of fifty five percent. Using dry fractionation rats fractionation you can get much higher. But for many applications. That might not be. Always Necessary. The essential part of Dr fractionation. Is to do the right. Milling. The milling Subi search. That we indeed get this entanglement. Between the two components. Of interest. In case of peace. We have small. Protein bodies. Around one to five micro meter and. We have larger. Starch particles in the order of thirty micro meter. The milling should be such that you really this internal. Those two components. And what color explored. Was that. To cause mailing. You end up in this area. No separation between the starch. And the protein. You can have two intense milling leading to starve breakage breakage and starch damage. Also leading to insufficient separation. So you have to optimize the rate of milling such that this is a gentleman or curse. The components are not damaged. And separation by air fractionation receiving. Is really possible. Dry fractionated material can have a range of applications. For example. A peak concentrate. Containing both protein and starch can be used in fish feed. Because in such a plea cation. We need protein for nutrition and starch. To bind to grow new owners. For example is made. By using protein. To stabilize fats droplets. And by using starch. To increase for Scar city. And also stabilize the products. So when you use them both and in such a fraction the might be even a molecular carbohydrate protein complex. That stabilized the product Eve or could be an advantage. Compared to the use of single and pure ingredients. We also know this that. In case of the production of a meat alternative. Soil concentrate. Partially fractionated material. Works even better than a saw isolate. So the carbohydrate seems. Essential as a structural. Agent. So don't remove them. Keep it in a Finally a group. Gluten and rich wheat flour. Can be used as bread improvement. So let's dry fractionation. And the ready set in the beginning of this clip. We'd milling. Is the most classical example of dry fractionation. This is our. Weed mill. In marketing and. It uses stones. To mill the material. And it's milled such that the weed brand. The wheat kernel. Can be separated into its constituents. The brand the endos and the germ. Please be aware that those fractions are not molecular pretty pure. That's correct or istic of dry fractionation. So we'd. Complains about ten to fifteen percent protein and the sperm actually. Carbohydrates mostly starch Lippitt mostly in the germ. And two percent ash. And the traditional process focuses on separation of wheat kernel. Into bran and the sperm. And germs. That we mimic today looks a bit different. Actually. Nice movies are available on You Tube If you're interested to see a real movie. How does work. Weed nowadays. And there's a big factory. And a militates a bit longer because we do the bit more. Size. First we remove. Course impurities like stones and straw etc then. Some water is added to condition the wheat kernel. The role of water addition is to soften the Brenn facilitating the separation. After that. Different that use of wheat. A mix together. To get constant. Quality protein compound for example hardness. Etc then. A series of milling processes. Occur. The first milling process. Is used to remove the brand. Further milling. Removal of the germ. Bit finer milling. And then finally. We also see. Completely milled material. Into a fraction called the sperm semolina. Really use for food applications to make Bastar to make bread etc and. They remain a fraction. Which cannot be used for food application. It's meant for feet. But the whole kernel is used. So some of the raw material to make bread pasta and other products. Be aware that fractions are not chemically pure. But highly functional. And the remarkable thing. Is that if you would like to make a whole real. Wholemeal flour. We first separate it into its to constituents and mix the cell Molina and the bran again. To get the right composition. This is the main difference compared to the traditional mill which destruction was made immediately. A remarkable situation first separation and mixing it together. But it works very well in this process. Of today. So if you enter a factory for mailing what you see. Ranges of cleaning equipment. And then mailers. Could be break rolls or even Mila's with the first. Mailing and the lots of seaven equipment. With the aim to separate the brand into those four main components. To conclude and to summarize. Dr fractionation could be a good alternative. For all the fractionation processes where it used to know what else. It's a bit of a sustainable process compared to what fractionation. We don't use water. We don't use chemicals. However we get. And the rich fractions. Rather than highly. Pure fractions. It really high purity is required then. Additional fractionation through with fractionation might be present. The functionality of the materials obtained through. Dry fractionation. Can be still quite close native functionality. Because no he does plight. No chemicals are part. And most classical example. Of dry fractionation. Is with milling and that process. We separated into. White flour to some Lena. The brand. The germ and the feet below were no pure ingredients. But highly functional fractions. And this concludes our knowledge clip. On Dr fractionation.",

Granulation. Improves. Product properties such as slow behavior. Reduced stickiness and improved dissolution properties. Then looting. Allows food control over the composition and helps the user. To apply to ride those an amount in its application. In this clip. The following topics. Will be covered. Granulation. Why granulation. And how to make regulators powerless. The second part of this clip focuses on terrible thing. Why tablets and how to make templates. Granulation is process. It Which part of particles are combined into larger granules. And three types of granules. Exist. As indicated on the slides. First of all we can believe we can have. Aggregated particles that form one. Granule. We can also have layering. Around the particle. And this is often done. In case the particle in the middle. Is very sticky. Adding small nonstick of particles outs. On the outside of this particle. Reduce the stickiness. Of the total particle. It is also possible to cold. Particle. And this is normally done. If this particle. Contains from rable. Ingredients. The causing can also be used to control the dissolution. Properties of that venue. How can you make. Granules. Binding of particles normally done with the use of a liquid binder. The liquid binder normally consists of a bio power. Being dissolved in water. Starts can be used for example. It is also possible to use a more than fat. In a granulation process. The particles are combined with a liquid binder to form the aggregate and the. Binder is then solidified. For example through evaporation of the water or more. Is use solid vacation. Solidification can be obtained through cooling. So what's happening in granulation. Particles are combined with a liquid binder. Forming an aggregate. And after that. The liquid binary solidified. Making solid bridges leading to a stable granule what. Growing your properties are we actually aiming for from experience we know that the optimal size of the granule. Is in the range of one hundred to five hundred micro meters. That gives optimal flow properties for example. It allows also. Sufficient size. To get a constant quality. So at this size it is possible that. Each granule. Contains all the components that you would like to include. Inside the granules and then. Makes no risk of segregation. Because all particles do have the same all grain used to have the same composition. Normally as you can see here. There is prosody. Inside a granule. And that. Ferocity. Improve the wet ability and. The water. Of improving the instant properties. Of your products. A few words about instant property. The solution properties. Some people consider it as a three step process. Other considered as a four step process. But these are the main steps. This integration. Some people include sinking. Dispersion. And the solution. First such a granule should disintegrate. Forming. Smaller particles. If the remains of big particle. It's not possible to dissolve it eventually. Then. The full of particles. Should be dispersed. Inside the solution and for some a placation for example. If those particles. Complaints that. This is sufficient. But for all the applications. You would like to have complete. Dissolution of your particle. And the rate of those phenomena. Should be carefully matched. Because if those are not completely matched then the dissolution process. Does not occur. Appropriately. To give you an example. In case. Dissolution of particles. The great particles here. Is very fast. What will happen. They will swell. While still attached to the other particles. As fast swelling. Lead to fiscus material. Allowing no further work. Water ingress. Or dispersion of those particles. You end up with a lump. Which does not dissolve completely. It is also possible that particles remain very sticky. So you're not able to disperse. All particles. Inside. The solution for this solution. It's better to have small particles because they dissolve. Faster. But too small particles. Too fast. Dissolution might hinder the disintegration. So when designing a granule. You should carefully match. The rate of this integration. Dispersion. And dissolution. Granulation. How do you do that normally. It's kind of summary. You make primary particles for example in a spray drying process. Then you wet. The particles again making breeches as indicated here. Which you solidify. Through drying. In case it's a liquid Binah. For most food. Sorceress. The production of primary particles. Is done by spray drawing as already said. It can also be milling of course milling of dry particles like seeds or piece. But we can also coat. Natural material. Knots for example. Which can be used as a starting material. After that. Granulation is done as post processing for. Process. And basically two thought processes. Occur. Through bad granulation. For granular powder. Fine powder particles or drum or pen granulation. Edifies. Is indicated here. And in this application. You can also use. Larger primary particles. As indicated in this application. Here we have not a stocking material. Which is and roped. By a liquid binder and upon heating. You get a dry cold thing. Eventually. So a drum granulation can be used from granular powers. But also to cold. Larger primary particles. The fluid that granulation. Is used a lot. What do you do. We have primary particles that are placed as a vet. Inside this device. There is blown through that. As a result of which. The particle starts to. Fluid eyes. They form a kind of liquid system. It's a fluid diced. That and onto that that liquid is great. That includes the binder. And this air force is drying of. The liquid binder. Making it a solid binder so by applying this process. You can make those larger granules. Just be careful that you don't spray too much liquid on to your bath. All the wires the bed might quench. Locally. The air is using very great water from the bino and the liquid dozing rate. Should Nachtwey. Ability of the air. To drive the amount of liquid binder. Add it to me too much to be too little food bed granulation. Can be operated continuous. And there twice. Continuous. It is normally done for. Large production volumes. That's why it's normally for small production volumes. So this concludes by part of granulation. You make primary particles do some. Post-processing. To form granules. With improved properties. Flow properties. In some properties. However. You can go even a bit further. Making tablets. Doublets can be considered as a very large granules and some products require and the biggest fantasy of a tablet is that it's follow. Unidos concept. The consumer does not have to weigh the amount of product. Needed to make a final product. One tablet. Is fish and. To make your final product. So a unit. Those concepts and only that. We also have the right composition. And this is especially useful soups and sources. For food applications it's a little bit the rare but non-food applications. People make all kinds of colors and imprints etc etc on two dollars tablets or a food. Applications normally the cube is most often used. Now how do you make those powerless. The part that used to make a tablet. Should have very precise properties. First they should have very good. Flow behavior. Because you made a tablet. But those in a certain amount of powder. Into a certain malt. And if you have worse. If the flaw. Properties are not good enough. Except dozing is very difficult. And secondly they should also have constant composition and. Thirdly the. Part of particles should be able to deformed. Easily. And upon the formation. They make all kinds of mechanical link in the mechanical linkages with the other particles. As a result of which. You can get a stable temp. Now the machine they always used follow the same printed full of this principle. Powder is dozed. Inside the mold. Then die. Comes down. Compresses the material. Goes up again. Then the other die. Goes up. You can reject the tablet. You can fill it again with power and the cycle starts again. And this process is normally decide in situ way. It's normally designed in a. What we called. Row three. Table. Press and. Is an important manufacturer of those devices. So power goes in on the top of the machine. Tablets go out here. And if you sue me in this part of the machine. What we see. We see a diverse. Round Table. With all kinds of dye and bunches and due to some mechanical engineering of this device. The punches go up and down. Following this principle. So if you follow. One round. This cycle has been executed. Filling of the die. Compressing. Going up. Ejecting filling again. Not to allow. Good compaction. We use lubricants for example. To facilitate the complexions to facilitate gliding of the particles over each other and facilitate injection of tablets. And of course the DI shape and. The prince determines the shape and size of the particle. And the space between. Dies. In the rate of compaction. He turns the strength of the tablet. So we are now making a tablet. We've made a tablet. And now it's important to measure the stress. Also here. We use rather empirical test. You take a terror alert put it in this device over here. Push it. And you measure the force needed to break the tablet. And the strength of the tablet. Requires a careful balance. It should be strong enough to allow handling and transportation. But it should be brittle enough to be destroyed by the consumer. And to allow this solution. In a liquid. So we have a binding mechanism of particles. Mechanical interlocking. Between particles. Created by a deformable and porous granules. And then you have to optimize this dilemma. One hand they should be able to resist the stress of protecting shipping and handling. On the other hand. They should be weak enough to allow good. Dissolution. No mechanical strength. Can be achieved can be assessed by simple tests like their product development stage or for technical test. More advanced applications. Can be applied. So to summarize this knowledge clip on granulation and tablet thing. Why do we actually want to make granules. Our tablets. The reason is that. Powers might not have the right. Properties. Powers with poor flow properties in some cases. And there's also a risk of segregation. Those problems can be solved by. Granulated powder. Particles than. Different part of particles can be combined in one granule. And you can improve the flow properties. As well as in some properties. The process mostly used in food industry. If you would bet granulation. A step further the production of tablets. You could consider it is a very large. Granule. And the biggest farm touch is that you combine in a sector amount of product. In one single unit. Easy to use for the consumer. It's Made. Through complexion of. Porous. Granular materials. And the binding magnetism is mechanical interlocking. Of those granules. This concludes the clip. On the granulation. And everything.",

                "text": "In this clip I will give information about food powers. It is an important. Product category. Within foods. In this clip. The following topics will be covered. Why do we actually make food powerless and then our food powers. Actually made. And is there any relation between. The production process of powers. And the resultant properties. And finally. I will tell something about mixing of powers. And many. Food Products are provided in part a form and here you see some typical examples. Dry soups for example or salt sugar. And some formulas. And when you walk in supermarkets. Maybe you fancy many more examples. The main reason. The main reasons for dehydration. Are weight reduction and. Increased shelf life. At ambient conditions part of products. A fairy stable. They have a fairly low moisture content. And as a result of very low water activity. Making them for example stable for microbial growth. Besides part of problems can be stored at Emory and conditions. We don't need strange conditions like. Cooling. Or reduced oxygen. Etc etc. Now I know they are stable at Emory and commissions. They'll weigh the factors. No water is present. So the neutral density. Is very high. And finally. Part of products are easy to handle. And easy to dose. There's one big drawback of powerless and. That's the lack of scientific methods to measure. Properties. And what you see in practice. Is that empirical devices like depicted here. I used to measure properties. And one of the most important property of the. It's flowing. Behavior. And that's measured in this device. Power is collected in a comb over here. Then is lit is opened. And powder is allowed to fall flat plate. It will form a pile of material and the mass of the material flows. The lower the pile will be a lower pile of material. Results in a lower. Angle of repose. To flowing power. Powder. Will result in a higher paddle. And as a result. A higher angle of repose. The flow properties. Are determined by the particle size of the material and. The aggregate. Behavior of the particles. Sticky and small particles. Will tend to aggregate. Leading to poor flowing. Properties. And for technical quality. I think the angle of repose. Should not exceed its value or for example. Thirty five degrees. And also for all the properties. Such measurements are available. How do we actually make a food power. Basically we have to menace. First. Is just milling. Take a solid material like a grain or a seat. Millet. And you end up with a powder. But the second one. Often using food industry. Is to make it from a liquid. Here you see a cup of coffee. And we would like to make instant coffee from it. How do we do it. The droplets. The coffee is dispersed in droplets. Up on heating the water is removed. And up with this product. And finally we have our instant coffee. Ideally. Mixing with water should lead to the same product. Of fortunately. It's probably not possible. Because in this process. You will lose some forethought components. And also there might be some thermal damage. Onto your product. So people strive for having the same follow thirty. But probably a quality might differ a bit. And how much the quality deteriorates. Depends on the drying process. Applied. Because you can do. Trying with. Heat and you can do the drying with low temperature. Trying at high temperature. Had biggest passages. It is cheap. It is fast. But it has the biggest effect on the quality of loss of all of the oil. And also thermal damage. Onto your product. And that results in this process. However the same brand. But a higher grade. Nescafe gold is made through this process so-called freeze drying trying at low temperature. And of course. Reduced pressure. It's a slow process. It's expensive but the quality is higher in amount of forethought being lost in this process. The slower. Actually to freeze dried process consists of two steps. First freezing. You remove energy from the product. And you reduce the pressure. And then you have to get an A G.. To allow water to evaporate. To be more precise sublimate. To end up with your final powder again. So this product. Lower quality. Dry through heating. Better quality. Thrice drives through drying. But also with thermal drying. We can distinguish between slow drying and fast drawing. A typical example of fast dry spray drying done in bake units. That you can find in industry. It's very energy. Intense process. Because you not only drive. Audit. Which also heat. Large amounts of air. And you don't use that energy anymore. However since process is so far. We have the effect of the evaporative cooling. So the temperature of your product. Does not become very high so it's a mild thermal process that leads to produce products. Of high wet ability to come to death. Slow drying drum drying as next sample for example. Highly energy efficient. But it gives a high thermal out on the product. Might have an effect on quality. And it leads to dense product. So the rate of he thinks. The terms of prosody of a product. And how does that work. Can be explained by considering. One droplet in such a drying process. Because a fast drying out of part. Will be dry. Thirty quickly. It will try. That fast. That moisture from the inside of the particle. Is not able to follow the rate of her peroration. As a result of which the outer part. Dries house. It solidifies. It might even become. In a glossy state. Since the outer part is solid. It's not able to shrink anymore. Which means that further drying leads to cracks and pours inside your material. Eventually the whole material world the whole. Particle will solidify. And it will contain a lot of force in a slow drying process as works a bit different. We have particle. And are just strings. Because the rate of these operations. At the outer part of the particle. Can be compensated by most accountants from the inner part to the outer part of a particle. So it can just three. Since. It remains mobile as well. Springs even further. And just in the final stage of the drying. It becomes a solid particle. So slow drying. Leads to a dense part. Of course. A far cry. These two. Forest Products. This is one other point with powders and that's the mixing of powers. Because hardly any food product consists of just one single ingredient. Normally it's a mixture of powerless. And it's not trivial to mix. Feria start powerless. So if I was treated powers and I would like to make one. Good mix with constant. Property and composition. How sure. Should I do this because particles. With different properties tends to segregate mixing of powder. Is really difficult. Now we have to make an isms. Percolation. Small particles. Can fill holes. Between large particles. So in such a system with particles having different size. The chance that the. Small particle goes down. Is of course much larger than a large particle filling such a gap what happens eventually we will have small particles in the bottom. And large particles on top. And this effect. Can even be enhanced by applying for Bray sion. Onto your system. By creating mobility inside. Particles which for example happens during transport. Also at the end of a pipe of an emetic transport separation can occur. If the density of those two particles is the same. And of course those particles will move much further from the pipe. Than the small ones. So. Also at the end of such a pipe. Segregation of particles can occur. So mixing of part of. Part of particles with different property sizes and then stick. Is difficult because of those mechanisms. That's why people develop special devices for mixing. And one of the mostly used equipment is a so-called field blender. It is rotating slowly along this. Yes And what happens. The power to make this combined. Splitted. Combined. Split it. For a couple of times. And that eventually ends up to a homogeneous power powder mix with the same proper. Particles. This devise is only meant for non sticking particles actually. If we have staked particles. Then you should also include some high sheering to detach the particles. The feed blender. Is a so-called. Diffusive mixer. You can also have convective mixer in no time mixer. It's like like this. The shape of the mixer. Combination with the movement of the arm and the rotation of the screw. Also helps to make a homogeneous Lee. Distributed. Powder mix. With three types of mixing. Actual mixing. Radio mixing and ten grams for mixing. By the arm. And this is sufficient to create a homogeneous powder mix. However if you have doubts whether the mixture. Remains a homogeneous mixture during transport or practicing etc. And you cannot allow yourself to ferry a shinning composition. You have to find another solution. And that's called. Granulation. Particles from different powers. Combined. In one single granule. With the help of a binder. Making such a grand you know. You're sure that the composition of. Each granule. Is more or less the same. And the risk of segregation. Of differences in composition is reduced. So primary part of the legal binding gets in the glamourous of a granule. Each granule has the same composition and. Often because it's a little bit larger the flowing properties are improved as well so. In this knowledge clip. I gave you information about the properties of food powerless. These farms which of poly probably. It is and those are very dense in nutrients and for this very stable up of storage. The actual process of making the terms of properties of the powder are largely fast drawing for example results of porous particles or slow drying processes gives dense particles. Mixing of powders needed to make a food product is not trivial. Because differences in particle properties such as size and density. Lead to separation. And that's why dedicated powder mixes such as a female in there and now the mixes have been developed. And this concludes the knowledge clip. On food powered us.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip I will introduce a process that used a lot of food industry. It is called extortion. Extrusion is used to make a Friday of products classical classical applications. Are the production of expanded products like crisps. The production of staple foods like pasta. And the broad range of animal feed. Applications. Here. Protein rich products. More modern applications are the production of fibrous materials. To be used for example as meat alternative. And besides the extruder is now a days used for modifications of. Biopolymers. For example. Through the use Vent times. How does an X. through to actually work. The purpose of an extruder. Is to make a certain shape. Inside your products and to make a shape in a product. The product should be called. The formal. And how to make a flower which can mean the glossy state deformable. We do it by adding water. To the material. And we can make the material even more deformable. By increasing the temperature. Through applying for heat. Moisture is normally removed. After the application through a drying process. And that's why people call. The moisture content. Often a process for ometer. Because you don't find that ingredient in the final product anymore. So we start mixing. The flour and water. We bring it inside the X. through it or. A rotating screw. Pushes the material to the dye. And the dye as the shape of the final product. You can say the more most original application of the extruder. Was there for a pump for highly fiscus. Material. And the thumping action. Of an axe through that is achieved by rotating. By a rotating screw. Insight. Well House. The faster this crew rotates. The faster the material will move from the feet so on to the diet. And the higher the pressure is that can we build up. The die. Bell house. Can be heated or cooled. To control the temperature of the product insight. To a certain extent. Also the dye can be cooled. Or heated. If we required short products. The short length. We can attach. Knife to the dye. To cut the material. In the decide like. If Would industry. Normally two types of extruded. I use. We have a single screw extruder. With one screw. Inside the extra. And another one is a twenty through extra in which two throws a presence. And a food industry. Normally the co-rotating extrude. Is used. This is achieved machine. For simple applications. This is a much more expensive machine. Useful more advanced application. And you are in product development stage. The working. Principle of a single screw extruder is based on friction between the material inside. The extra and the bare wall that friction makes that material move from the feed to the dying inside the extra. And if friction is lost between. The material and. The barrel wall. The material will not move any more inside the extra. And you can show it by looking at this picture. Here we have a screw and a not if there is not friction between the knot and the wall. You can say or no friction between enough and. A device like this banner the knot will just rotate. At the same spot on the screw. Just when. Including friction. It will move along the screw. A similar principle holds for a single screw extra. So friction between of wall and the material. Is very important. And that explains why we try to rough on the bare house. For example by inclusion of grooves. Inside the bell house. If slip. Occurs inside extra The X. through this blocked. And the only solution is to clean the machine. And start again. Since the risk of slip is there some components are difficult to use. Fat for example. Can easily act as a lubricant. Increasing the risk of slip. And that's why. Fed is normally not used inside a single screw operation. If the final application requires that we added afterwards. For example by spraying fact on the final product or. Apply an additional processing stuff such as frying. Also the water content. Should be a rather low or high water content. Might lead to some water. Expelled from the toe. Leading to slip. As well. So using a single script through a simple the forest for the range of materials that can be used is relatively limited. And that explains the use of a twin screw extruder inside of vent to extrude. The pumping action is. But. Positive. Displacement. The screw one screw. Blocks. The other screw. As a result of which you. And close the material more or less. In the kind of chamber here. And the chamber moves from the feed to the diet. And the material which is in such a closed room or shaving chamber also called chamber. Then has to follow. So the transport mechanism cost of the placement. Depends far less. On the friction between the wall and materie. Depends far less on the theory of properties. As a result of which. More material can be extruded. You can make more advanced. Products and. Of course in the product development stage which would like to play with conditions and materials. It is handy to use. Inside twins through extra. You can use a range of screw elements. To control the process even better. Here you see for example mixing elements. That applies more shear on to your material. And here you see elements that course. That create the pumping energy. Needed for the makes in later on in mixing elements. And this is a part of a barrel house. And you see a need to place for two screws over here. In the next section. I will explain a bit how the faeries products commit using extruder. First I will talk about the production of starch. Containing products that can be expanded. Then I will explain something about. Production of foster stable foods. And finally we will focus on. Protein rich products like indicated here. Starch based products like those scripts. Are normally made using a single screw. Extra. And the remarkable thing is that those products have to contain starch. Because starch is one of the few components. That is able to form those. Expanders products. If you would like to use all the materials. The concentration should be such that starts remains to continuous face. Inside those products. To allow expansion. Started to build you let's not just. How can you create starch gelatin ization. You can do this for any water. And apply heat. Once the starter is Gillette a nice the material. Comes close to the. And after the die expansion will follow. How do you create expansion. You create expansion by flashing. Of water flushing off. Of water. Once the product. Exits the die. And of course. After that water evaporation. The material should be free of the stable. Should be rather solid to maintain that shape. Which is created after expansion. And to allow water being flushed off. The material should be under pressure inside the. Extruder. Schematically you can demonstrate it like this inside X. through it or you create a super heated though. And then the product. Goes through to die. Directly after the die was a flash off the product expands and gets its final shape. Eventually the amount of water. Which is present in the super heated though. Is critical if with too little water. Then. Expansion will not be complete if we have too much water. Then. This material will mean this will not be solid enough to maintain its final shape. Production of pasta. What's the purpose of extortion. In pasta production. Actually it is twofold first. It should create a gluten network. And second. It should create sufficient pressure to push material through a die. To create the final shape. The range of dyes exist. Which allow the production of a broad range of products. And something about the glue the network formation. Here. You see a picture. In which we mixed. Flour and ice and let the ice melt. This is a made without any the formation. What do you see. We see. Green. Lose. Starch particles. And we see a red. BACHUS but those red patches to gluten face. Is not really connected. Picture behind a picture over here. Shows. Connectivity between if Arius gluten factious. A Gluten network has been created. And how it has been created. Has been created through the formation of the formation that occurs inside an extra so fast their production. Mixing of water and flour. What the should really enter the flour particles that Mike. Day that might take some time. That explains why sometimes the mixing is done. Outside the extra. Gluten as workroom ation. The shaping Di geometry and. Finally drying. Those product has to be dry. And the drying should be done very carefully. If it goes too fast. Cracks might occur inside the product. And that leads to a reduced quality. And drying of those products. Might take up to fifteen hours for example. Using fairy models. Try and conditions. We have two thirds of Pastor on the market. The regular pasta which you have to boil yourself. Contains starch which is NOT mean you let an iced during boiling at home. Start it will generate a nice. And the gluten network should prevent a large amount of starch loss. Cooking loss as they call it preventing of star gelatin sation can be done by law. By using a low temperature inside the extra. But nowadays you also have ready to eat pasta. And as such a product. Start is a LARRY. Gillette nice and how can you create starch to let in is ation by using a combination of high temperature inside the X. through to and. Sufficient water. On the other hand. The temperature of the die should be really low. Because the product should not be X.. And as demonstrated in previous. Product category. So high temps are inside the extra. That's relatively low. That's a giant the final application. Is the protein rich. Product category of protein rich. Products. It's used to make a large range of feed for example but also fish feed pellets. Which are indicated. On the bottle. What's the purpose of doing this. Each granule. Should have more or less the same composition. So you're sure that the animal gets its right nutrition. So inside extra we make pellets in which faeries ingredients are combined. And normally an intense thermal treatment is applied to increase the dirtiest billeted. Of the proteins of those products and. After extrusion. A slide expansion is necessary to create forest. Particles. Because. For example for fat. For fish feet. We need oil to be included in size of products and. Oil cannot be extruded. Leads to slip a single screw extrusion. So we have to add it. Afterwards. In a special coating. Defies. You know might understand that. Next through there is not a single. Stand alone machine. That normally fits in a whole range of devices and there's lots of equipment. Here we have the extra. And the forty extra we can have a mixer. For example to mix dry ingredients the flour and water. And to let it stand for a while to allow sufficient water ingress. After X. through Jand. We made a product. It has to be dried. And sometimes oil or Fed has to be added in a separate coating device. Once the product is completely made. It goes through the labeling infecting department. To create a final product. IN ITS FINAL. Package. And this ends the knowledge and in this knowledge clips I introduced. Extrusion. Extrusion is used for a wide range of products that are highly fiscus during processing and require heat for the final application. The dye configuration determines the aisle to shave of the products. Often the extruder is placed in and told the process changed with those equipment before the X. through it or and drawing equipment afterwards. More the research focuses on the amount of water added. To reduce the amount of water added because that also reduces the drying to the off the worse and more complex transformations such as fiber formation. And the medic qualification. Of carbohydrates apologise. And his death. I conclude the knowledge to live. Extrusion.",

                "text": "Hello. Today I'd like to tell you something about two years of life lost. Is one of the summary measures we use in public health it's a measure for Population Health. And we also call it a health get. Matter. And to explain it a little bit further to you I'd like to compare it with what you already know from a former clip. The life expectancy. So that's what we're going to discuss now. We have life expectancy already know. And years of life lost. Life expectancy every V.A. to L.T.E. measures what is being achieved in a population. So how many years I'm expected to live. After my year. Which is now fifty three. Well years of live last Y L L s. Every V.A. sion. Measure of the mount of years who are which are lost. I come back to that later. So the life expectancy is generally expressed for on average. Is an average for one person. And it's the number of years. Someone can expect to live. After a certain age. Well the years of life lost. Measures what's being lost. But usually is expressed for the total population. Not for one person. And in total it's the number of years that it's potentially lost by dying. Before a certain age. And this is what we call a health gap. But maybe it's becoming more clear after you've seen this slide the graph. So the life expectancy. You see here to traditional survival curve we started one hundred percent survival. At age. Is zero. And of course at the end. Almost everybody died at age one hundred and. The area under diff curve. Is what we call the life expectancy. Remember that's how we calculated using the Life Table. So this is the life expectancy. But if you think about the gap. We just a few minutes for example an ideal situation that. Everybody survived until. Year one hundred. And then. This is the. Gap. The difference between. Direct angle. Indicating everybody surviving. Until one hundred and. The life expectancy of this population. So these gifts. Are usually actually. Deceased specific. While life expectancy is usually generic not for a disposition. Cause of death. So what we often calculate is for example years of life lost due to mortality of cancer. Now if you think further about his years of life lost you need an ideal situation. In the previous slide we said. The ideal situation is living. Until one hundred years. Here we give another example so you assure him you know how long a person should live. When he was not lost. Because of this disease for example. So we need to say something about. Optimum survival. And we see here it is in this curve we can have three possibilities. You can take a fixed. Age and say OK. Seventy five years of age is my. Optimal survival is so if I die just before my age of twenty my years of life lost. Are Here. Until the age of seventy five. The lowest. Line here in this graph. But I can also take the ideal situation as being the current life expectancy that's the blue curve in this slight. Or I can take ideal life expectancy and there's a life expectancy of some sort of. Ideal. Free living population. But I have here put a one watt warning. On the current life expectancy that says it's a moving target because the current life expectancy changes because it depends on the mortality. Your population is experiencing. So it's. So it's not fixed. So therefore seventy five years of age for example may be a little bit more clear. In the book we used to terms. The expected years of life lost and the potential. Years of life lost. And what I was talking about taking a fixed age of seventy five is what we call. Potential years of life lost. Calculation. It uses a fixed age. In expected years of life lost. We used the population life expectancy at the individuals. Age of this. But of course. Different countries may have different life expectancies for example so when comparing. For example different countries. You can have a problem in that. There's also a problem when you have a change in mortality. There's also a change in life expectancy and then again. This influence your calculation your for your. Expected years of life lost. And sweet usually. Preferred this. I'll deal. Life expectancy and then the potential. Years of life lost. Now we talked about the differences between. Life expectancy in years of life lost but there are also similarities. So both. Like to repress sent the impact of mortality on the population level. And in both calculations death at the young age is a greater loss than death. As an elderly person. So in general. It focuses attentions on conditions that kill younger people. Accidents or cancers. More than it kills. Older people. So when we make a rank order of courses of deaths and look at the mortality statistics the rank order can be different in the mortality rates compared. Comparing the different diseases. Then when we look at life expectancy. Or years of life lost due to specific diseases. So keep that in mind but. Gift of life loss can be course specific. While life expectancy normally never is now there's also another similarity and that's when we compare two groups. Then you see that the outcomes are closely related. And that you can see in this light. We see here two survival careers. One for smoking population. Which is the doctor curve. And one for non smoking. Population. The black. Curve. And we see here the life expectancy of the cigarettes. Mochas is the area. Below the dotted line. The life expectancy of the nonsmokers is the area below the black curve. I mean we look at the difference. We have this. Small area. The gap. Area. And that is the. Years of life lost all the difference in life expectancy between smokers and nonsmokers. But when we talk about years of life loss we look at the other side of the curve. Which is the right hand side. We. Again had. I think. Ideal life expectancy of one hundred years. And then we subtracted two gets from each other one gap. Starting at the black curve and the other gap. Starting at the. Doctored curve. And again the difference in areas is exactly the same area. The area between the two curves. So this visually. Shows you that the difference in life expectancy in the difference in life you. Lost between smokers and nonsmokers is exactly the same. So in the end. Message. It doesn't matter so much. However there is one big difference. The difference in life expectancy is usually expressed in years for a person. So let's say. The smoker loses ten year of life expectancy. And this is as a health communication message a quite strong one. The difference in years of life lost. Is usually X.. Rest for total population. And then for example. Years of life lost due to smoking worldwide is almost one hundred fourteen million years. Again an impressive number. For Smoking it doesn't matter perhaps so much but if you think about eating an extra apple a day. What would it mean in life expectancy. Well let's assume it's a small effect let's say. I add one week to my life. Then you would wonder. Well. Who cares. But if I expressed this four million people in here as of life lost. This one week of added extra life expectancy translates to one million. Multiplied by one week. Is about twenty thousand years. Which are extra. When you eat an apple a day. And then again this number is quite large soda consumer will think OK. I should eat more apples. So please be aware that this difference in can make a difference in health communication messages. So in summary. You have see now. What are the years of life lost. And that is a gap measure. When you compare it to the life expectancy measures we have been discussing before. And I also warned you about the time frame. Please watch out for the differences in scale.",

                "text": "It will it be a between faces in makes your. Most foods are mill decisis and Russian components can be present in more than one face. The most disgusting gradient is water. This can be present in various parts of product. In case there is no equilibrium between the various faces for war. This will cause migration of water from one face to the other. So I will discuss different. Equilibrium. Situations. So the first one was. Water which can be responsible for my strands for. Another example of an equilibrium. Is the solution of a shell you're in a solvent. For instance. Such a way that your question ocean. And this version of biopolymers and water. For instance protein or water. Are starch. In water and frozen products we have it could be I'm between. Water which is partly in the eye state and partly. Into liquid state. And product that gas the salt in liquid. For instance. Governor I did. Soft drink. And beer and the question is. Every moment. Is there. Equilibrium. All we can say. It was a clip of him. And case the chemical potential. In one face is similar to the chemical potential. In the out of phase. This is the case for melting. Freezing or on the other hand for boiling and conversation. Then we have two faces together and a chemical potential. Of the specific component. In this case water or similar. And both faces. Other examples are. You have to ration. For instance of a slave component. The solving of a solid and liquid. And the solving of a gas in the liquid for instance the carbon dioxide in soft drinks. Are In case of. Extraction. We have the partition. Of a component of two faces to liquid. Yeah I have stayed I gram of make your share of the sugar. In this diagram. Can distinguish. Regions which I do one face. That's the liquid solution for instance and a glass. And we have. Regions with two faces. It's the. Faber and the solution where we have the water vapor and a. Joshi lotion. We have a solution. To get of it. Sugar crystals. Or we can have a solution. To get of it. And besides that. There are so the boiling line. And a freezing line. Where you also have an equilibrium. Situation. In case of a show you out in a solvent. We talk about the activity of the the salt component. And the activity is related to its concentration or. Mulla friction. And the proportionality. Between do is given by the activity coefficient. This leads to an activity. Being between one and zero. Its maximum one. And the activity can be considered as a sort of effect of concentration. It is fact a measure for the interaction between the Salyut. And the solvent. And it dealt a something about the. Escaping tendency of the shell yet. From the solvent. But a day. Can exist to get a. Well or not. In case it was a strong interaction. And a good sort ability. The activity cautions will be lowered and one. Dolby attraction between the cellular and solvent. And the mixing will be very spontaneous. It's a stable system. And you devotee caution is one. There's no specific interaction. You can cite or engage the activity of it and one and Russia for interaction and. The wreath also forces dominate. In sector the Salyut and solve it cannot easily mix. And they actually date they stabilize each other. And in order to make them. You have to bring in energy. Here's an example where you can ask the question. Is there equitably and they have water in the siren. And the in a part of the product. And we have signed up in the waffle. And we know. The water content. In the Sarup. Is higher than in the awful. So you want to know. It couldn't be much to transfer from the shire up to the waffle. Well we know that the water content in the south is higher than in a waffle. But at the same time. The sugar has a high affinity for water. And because of this. The water activity in the shire up and waffle. Are the same. So there's a clearly him. And it will be no transfer from of water from the. Syrup. To what the bottle. It's a stable product. In case of extraction. Of a shunt component from phase one to face to begin. Think of the situation would want to tell you what a molecule. X. of valuable component. And to solve and faces. To liquid. Souls and faces French's oil and water. And this. Component. Will the fight itself. Over to do faces and. How it will divide over the two faces. That depends on the activity Gulf and of the component. In the two faces. This is given by the partition goldfish and it tells us whether the main part of the show it will come in phase one. Or in face to. Here we have an example. We have the a crucial ocean. And the organic solvent. If you mix the two. It will that all be in in one site. But after waiting for a while. There will be the mixing again. And in this case. The black component. Will be in the a crucial ocean and the yellow one will be. In the organic Shushan. So there is the mixing again. And they grab the chemical potential. Of this component exchange will be the same. Into oil and into water face. So the molecules. Will divide themselves over to both faces. Another example is the dissolving of gas in a liquid. And you had a Henry's Law as Fell it. And it says that. At the constant temperature. The amount of a given gas that filled the self. In a given type and volume of liquid. Is proportional to the pressure of that gas. Which is in a clip. The dead leg which he will have the situation where we have a component. Well the ret particles. And we have a liquid. And in this situation. Well there is no no no molecules present in the. Liquids. But I guess the pressure is increased the amount of the particles that will. This self. And the liquid face. Will increase. So this is what we see in this when we see question. The pressure is increased the amount of. Component or. Molecules that will be to solved in the liquid face will be increased as well. And the proportionality is given by the head which go off and. So this just at the shell you belittle. Of a gas. In a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure. The gas. Above the liquid. And that's what we use in carbonation. Of soft drinks. This Henry sculpture and. It depended on the temperature. Here we see that the shot ability. Of oxygen is strongly decreased. At the higher temperature. This can be derived from the equation. Which gives the temperature of the pendant. The hired a temperature. The lower the shell you belittle. And example of. This is true for a fish in the air in water. At higher temperature for instance. The level of oxygen. Will be lower in the water and. Probably not all fish will survive. This Henry's government. It's given in literature. And you have to be aware that it could be given in two ways. It can be based on a must for action. Or it can be based on the concentration and depending how it's given the unit is different as well. So often it whenever extracting. Data from literature. Have to be aware of these two ways off of the potations of this. Hundred. Goldfish and. Then you have a situation of a mixture of larger than by a Polish for starch and. Protein in water. Then about activity. This water activity. Depend On the following fraction of water. To how much water is present. But also of the affinity. Of the cell use for the moisture. This affinity is given in effect a guy. In case was a strong affinity. Of the soul you'll show all of the proteins. For water. This guy factor will be lower. So French is the lower lying. In this graph and gays are as a poor affinity. Then this. I factor will be higher. So in this graph is she a certain amount of water. Can be I can give Iraq a low water activity or high water activity. The more the affinity. Of the shell you try water. The lower. The water activity. So effect. The protein. Short of immobilizes. The water and. Result in a lower. Water activity. Another example is their crystallization of water in the emotional oceans up on phrasing. In the situation. We have an agrarian. Between water. And the ice crystal. Water is surrounding the ice crystal. And they have their. Ice crystal. And again. At equilibrium. The to demagogue potential. Should be similar. All combining to do. Gives this equation. And the bending on. What we know or what is given. We can derive the factors that we do not know. And again. The rife. For instance the water activity. Of the water present in this. Equilibrium. System. This brings me to any conclusions on the ground we are in mixtures develop the equilibrium between a fatal. And a chemical potential. Is the same in both cases the activity is related to the concentration or to the mall a fraction but it's not the same. There is an activity. As a proportionality. So the ability. Is influenced by the interaction between solid and water. So Mistral for. This version to fall of mush. The partition. Of the component. And water activity. Is influenced by the affinity. Of the shell you would for the solvent. And I gaze of a gust. We can say that the salability is dependent on the temperature and all the bottle pressure of the gas. Above. The liquid.",

                "text": "Equilibrium between faces. And I will focus on water. Since in many food. The role of water is very important for its stability of food. Also in various processes through transfer of water. For improving the stability of the food. A system a stable. When there was a Caribbean. Where as water will migrate to another face was no. Equilibrium. Let's first look at the state diagram of water. We can distinguish three different challenge. Ice water and vapor gas. Here in these regions what exists in one face. But at the equator being light to the lines between different places. They two faces going to exist together. And they are in equilibrium. So indication of boiling. The gust fate and the liquid fate. Are in equilibrium. The same is true for the melting or the freezing line here. The solid. Water and the liquid water or and it could. Agrarian. And then the other one for the sublimation or the solid and a gas face our existing to get of. You could say there is a going to be in between faces. When the chemical potential of all components is equal in both faces. The sheer will of what I did. Boiling point. The chemical potential of water. In a liquid fight. Will be equal to the chemical potential. In the gas face. And the same holds for. For instance fold out components which can exist. Both in a water fight and in a gas fight. So we say. The chemical potential is the same. And in this case I talk about water so I it is water. There are some other. Equilibrium situations as well. I mentioned already. The melting and the freezing. So then the chemical potential in the ice. Is similar to the chemical potential in the liquid. But also other. Think of evaporation. So. Out of component. We again say the chemical potential. In the water fight. Similar to the gas face. So in case of boiling. We talk about water what is next in case of flavor components for instance. We talk about this specific flavor component. Another example of this solving. For instance assault. In a liquid. The salt can be president and in the solution. Another example of the solving is gas. In a liquid. For instance combination of. Soft drinks. Then we have gravel dioxide in a gas face and we have carbon dioxide in the water. And then we have. Extraction. Here we try to partition. A component over. Two faces we want to extract a compound from one face to the other site. And at equilibrium. In this case. Again we can say. The chemical potential. Of this specific component. For instance in a water fight is similar to the chemical potential in the. Or. I'll fight. All this chemical potential. And the bench on the pressure. The temperature. And the composition of the component. So we have a chemical potential at the reference state. That the first part of the formula. Then rest the influence of the pressure. Influence of the temperature. And the influence of the composition. And that a composition. We look at the molar fraction of the specific component. Here we have a situation where it could be adopted. In a GA. French as a liquid droplet in a gas face. And it's first situation. The chemical potential. In the liquid face. Is larger than into. Surrounding gas face. Or here. The chemical potential in the shrouding is larger than into. Droplet. And then there will be movement of molecules from the region. With the high potential to the low potential. Let's look at the chemical potential in. Different different situations. A gas a liquid or a solid first one for a gas. This formula. Can be used in any faith. So here it is give afford a gossip right. And then you got here we have the reference state. Standard chemical potential. You have the influence of the pressure and temperature. And these three. Are combined. To a standard. Chemical potential at the shut in pressure and temperature. And then rest the composition part. And that translated into this part of the formula. And as such this. It tells us. What's the bottle. But you'll think the pressure of the specific Guss component of the total. Pressure gauge of a pure gust we can say this. X. is one. And then they start. The following day because it is zero. To get them. Then the situation for a component in a liquid. Again we have the same formula. And again. The street terms are combined to the stand that chemical potential at a given. Pressure and temperature. And this part. Is done for the Mulla fraction of the component. In the mixture. Well. We can rewrite this formula. Where we introduce a water activity. Any case of pure water. We can say the actual you is one and a water activity is one. And again. This part of the formula can be deleted and second. What's left over. Is the standard chemical potential. Then the situation for ice. It's a bit different. If you're right from the chemical potential for water. And at the temperature below the freezing point. The potential. They'll be decreased. Compared to water. In this formula. We have the equilibrium freezing point of pure water. So that's a twenty seven two hundred seventy three degrees. You have to freezing temperature. Which is below or. And we have the molar and will be freezing. Or melting in this formula. We are at here at a great sense centigrade. This star. Will be. The fall of eighty two to it's zero. So then you can see that. The chemical potential in ice and water are similar. In case we are a few degrees below the equator be in freezing point. So let's say minus ten degrees centigrade. Then the chemical potential for ice will be lower than the one for water. Then there is no more. Equilibrium and. It will lead to a transition. Of liquid water to water in the. Solid state. So. Transfer of water. To ice. Let's look at some equilibrium situations. Let's look at the situation for water. Where we can say that the comical potential in Augusta. Is similar to the one in water. Now we can fill in water for the term so we have the star. The boat. Are equal This is the part of the Gus face. This is the bass part for the water fight. And for pure water we can say that the vapor is such righted. That water. The solution. And if they are. Nuclear. Equilibrium. And in the case of pure water. The water activity. In a solution. Is one. And the relative humidity in the vapor will be one as well. This part of the formula. And this part of the formula. It can be considered equal. Because the pressure and the temperature. Are assumed to be equal in the different faces at equilibrium. So they can be deleted. Against each other. Then the situation for water in makes your shell fresh sugar makes your a mixture of sugar in water so. Water. Plus certain Shall you would again be going to show you the potentials are equal. So. Upon boiling of this. Mixture of water and so you would. We can. Again. Make them. Similar. But now. The water activity. Will be a bit lower than one. And then. The result is that the relative humidity. Of the vapor. That is in a clearly in the dish water in the solution would also be. But lower than one. And again we are showing to be pressure and constant and temperature effect. To be similar for both faces. So we can say. There is a gray area between faces when when a chemical potential for both fighters. Is the same. And if in the case that they are not the same. There will be transfer of components. From the region with a high chemical potential. To the region that the local nickel potential.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I will discuss. Quantity of aspects of the drying kinetics. Which we do. And what we do is we are going to calculate drying time for both a constant rate drying period. And a full and re drying ball. Barrett followed by a dryer design. Taking this into account. So first. Talking about quantification. Or characterization of the driving behavior. We show. Or we use very often a drying rate girth. On the drying rate growth rate of drying is supported on the Y. axis. And on the X. axis. The plots of the amount of moisture in a product. We read from the right to left. We start with a wet product that heats up to the temperature. And we had then. Have constant rate. There a constant rate there is which is correct rise by the constant rate of drying I this put you in this period. The product is all the time. At the with built temperature. This period ends. When we reach the critical moisture contents. At that point. The process becomes the fusion limited. The product starts to heat up. And the drying rate will decline. Following this line. Eventually we may approach. Equilibrium washstand more secure contents. And that is then once the content that we would achieve. When having full eclipse. The moisture content. In a product. And moisture content. In the air. From days drying rates girth. We can actually do you drive. The drying times. So how long do we not need to dry. In the first. And in the second periods. I will first. Show how to drive the drying time for the concentrate period. For death we define the total mass of moisture. To evaporate. So. Which is expressed as the initial moisture content. Minus. The critical moist it comes and divided by the drying time. We also. State here. The rate of hip or a separation. On the basis of heat transfer. And the amount of he transferred. Equal to the heat transfer coefficient multiply think the surface area. Multiplied by the driving force for drying. Which is the difference in temperature. The air temperature. And the temperature need to surface of the product. Then during the concentrate drying period. We can actually state that the amount of heat transferred is equal to the amount of water evaporated. If we multiplied the amount of water if ep aerated. With the heat of entropy. So there is no heat loss to the environment. Or heating up of the product. We operate. At the Red Mill temperature. Not combining this. Expression with the previous two expressions. We can obtain. The following relationship. So this first part. Expresses the decrease in one sense. If I did by the drying time. Multiplied with the heat of the separation. And that is equal to the amount of heat transfer out on this site. Not. Rearranging this equation. Yields is the time for the concentrate. Period. Which is a function of. Especially the temperature difference that is applied. So if we apply a higher temperature difference a higher temperature. Then most likely. The temperature of the time required for drying will drop. The bit. This. Drying time it derives on the basis of heat transfer. And we know that heat transfer and mass transfer. Are quite intimately connected. So we can actually. Also do you arrive. The drying time. From the mosque. Transfer site. That we are going to do. In the next life. So here we have the saying. Definition forty. Removal of moisture. But we hear. Described the rate for hip aeration. In terms of mass transfer. You mount. What are being moved. Is proportional to the transfer call fish and. Most likely to surface area. Multiplied. With the density. Multiplied threesome over friction difference. Of the moisture near the surface. Minus. The moisture in the air. The Course. We use here molar fractions. And effects. When we design drives we prefer to work with the community ratio or the most to content per kilo dry air. I state this definition here. Which expresses the humidity ratio. As a function of the amount of. Most water. You fired by the amount of moles of air multiplied meet their respective molecular weights. We will use that later. To convert. The motor fraction. Into humidity ratios. Here again. We. Couple. Amoss transfer. The amount of. Moss. Of water evaporates. To the amount of mass transferred from the product. To the air. So now we are going to change or replace the smaller fractions and. Also we are going to replace this density. First. This one. So we approximate. That humidity ratio. Is proportional to the mode of fraction of water multiplied with the ratio of the molecular weights. And for the density of air. We replace that using I would guess law by the pressure divided by to get schools and multiply the temperature. And then we obtain this expression which contains here. The time for dry. And. This site. The driving force for driving which is the difference. In most the content here surface. Which is a separate. Paper. Minus. The temperature of the moisture content. In the air. Now that provides us with a total formula which we can use to calculate the drying time. And in principle. That should match. With the drying time do right on the basis of heat transfer. And that is because we operate in the constant rate. Regime here in which the heat and a mass transfer. Are directly coupled so similar rising. We have these two expressions to assess the length of the concert rate. Drying period. We can also use. The differential form. To the rife. Or use for calculations. Where we connect. The driving force for driving sort of the temperature difference between the air and. SURFACE. To change and moisture content. Between the initial and final musher contents. Then the next period. The falling rate period. We're also going to describe. In terms of drying time. For death we use this formula. I will not explain how we expected to arrive this formula. If that is beyond the scope of this novice clip. What I would like to state here. Is the change in moisture content. The W.. Is the final moisture content will be slick Libya most of the columns and sees the critical moisture content. So the change in moisture content is a function of. This exponential term. Where A and B.. Operand letters that are typical for and depend on the geometry of the product here we see a table with A and B.. For different types of geometries for slap for sale and then a for sphere. And for example for slack we have eight. Over by square. And for B.. We have the square it's divided by four. So we can fill in these values in this equation. And then we remain with this. Number that's a four year a number. And they're the drying time is hidden. Because the full year number is defined as if you see fifty. Of water. Multiplied. We could be fired by the square. Squared size. Thickness of the product. So here you can already see that we make for example in Ascension that a diffuse city during the falling rate period is constant. And this is of course not the case. But as a first approximation. That is OK. So using this formula we can assess the drying time. Later on in an example of a show how to do that we also can use the differential form. I showed it here. So here we have plotted the drawing rate curve. The rate of dry. Versus the unit of moisture in the product. We drive and also the final Condon. Force which is not equal to the Caribbean more sickening because that would take a very large stipes often. Experimental data are collected and plotted. And these type of ports and then. In fact. We get this. We can use this equation. To do right for example. The if overall or average if you see fifty values. Because the slope. Of this. Line is equal to disturb. Be multiplied by to be physically defied by a square. Thickness of the product. Here. I show you that we can. That. There's a limit for the dry. And that is the equilibrium. Water content. About which I thought before. This equilibrium is the most accountants. Which would be in equilibrium with the relative humidity. Of the air. So it's a relative humidity and water fifty of the product would be equal. We would have this moisture content. In a product. And that's dependent on the type of product and. Yeah this is a difficult source and I said to him You have probably seen before. Drying beyond the equilibrium or cyclone and it's not possible as then. The product would be wet again. By product. By air. So simmer rising. Drying kinetics. We have expressions for time for drying too in a constant rate period. Based on heat transfer heat transfer and for and also an expression for the falling rate period where the drying time. Is within. If we a number. Now I will show you an example where we apply these formulas. And we consider the drying of tomatoes. From ninety. Till twenty five percent. Wet basis. Of course. We could supply high temperature drying which proceeds. Most likely faster. But this results in a normally so I pulled a quality. Sample having a less attractive color or lose of some nutritional. Components like lycopene. And also the flavor. Will become less. OK. So we are going to explore but it's possible to achieve a low temperature drying. Of course still within reasonable driving times. First we find out some literature data. On the physical properties. Of tomatoes. For example. But if you see fifty goldfish and. He transferred all fish and we also recalculate the initial. Mostly contents into moisture content on dry basis. So we start with ninety percent. And that is proportional to ninety eight zero. Waterpark you'll drive that are the critical moisture content that was. So. Obtain a value for. And it is two point nine hundred seven. Also the dimensions of the tomato are depicted here. So the don't know total diameter of the. Tomato slices five centimeter. While the thickness of the tomato. Is five millimeter. That the density is approximately thousand cubic you know from these values who also do rife some values. For example the surface of the. Tomato the volume and irrespective of want to make a slice. We also. Obtain information from a source and this is very relevant for. Later on to also define until what's final moisture content we can dry. Which is at twenty five percent average if you made it. So disorganized in terms are for different temperatures twenty five thirty or forty degrees and. Because we operate. At forty degrees. The temperature. We're going to use. Values for these temperature. Here you see actually do a formula that describes the source and I said to him. Which is a hop I said to him. Now. We're going to design. The dryer. Using the. Psychometric chart. We choose. Air temperature. For the dryer. Suppose we use a temperature of forty degrees. So having a dry built temperature of forty degrees. If we use normal. Water contents. Then if we heat up the air to forty degrees. Then the relative humidity. Will be approximately eighteen percent. If we don't look at it at your Benteke situation. Girth. We see that the Red Mill temperature is supported in the twenty one degrees and this is the temperature at which the product will settle during a constant rate drying. Period. So that will be acceptable in terms of. Effects to quality of the product. Now we're going to use the previously discussed. Expressions for drying time. And fill in the data that we have. So this is the. Drying time for to consider a period. We fill in history heat of the separation between circle fish and. The surface area for one tomato slice. And we also fill in the initial most of the critical much the contents. The air temperature and the dry built temperature and a well built temperature which is the temperature near the surface of the product which is twenty one degrees. Now and then we end up with this trying time. In our Paquito. We should be careful here because the surface area is only for one tomato slice. And effect that is that needs to be corrected for these time. So therefore need we need to multiply through the mass of one tomato slice. Yielding a final. Drying time. Of fifteen hours. That's a quite long drying time. And actually it can lead to. For example spoilage and also to time. Is too long for example to make this process stick into an economically feasible process. So we actually prefer to have the products to dry at somewhat higher drying temperature. And actually also. We can go help a somewhat higher. So that the wet built temperature for example would be at forty degrees. Now if we go then back to the psychometric charts. We see that we can go. Until a tribal temperature of the hundred thirty six degrees. And then still if we follow the about exaggeration line the product is at forty degrees well built temperature in this case we see that the relative humidity of the air has decreased. To open four percent. So having. Much more capacity to absorb favor. Our Higher driving force for drying making. Most probably the drying time it shorter. So let's fill in the new values. In the equations. So we have the same equation and new values. It's. Only. What are the temperatures the dry Bill temperature minus the. Well built temperature. We feel that then we correct. With the mass of a single slice. And we obtain a final drying time for the coals and re drying period of three hours. Which is effective five shorter than the previous. Temperature and. Still the product does not become older or higher in temperature than forty degrees. Which actually. Guarantees that the properties of the tomatoes are pretty sure of. Relatively well. So this is a nice way to operate in the first period. Then the second period. And the falling rate period. We go from the critical moisture content to the final moisture content. So we end up with twenty five percent relative humidity or. Twenty five percent. Water activity. And then. We have the most the content of corresponding with most the contents of. Opened one three kilo on dry basis. We also know. The equilibrium oyster contents. That is zero point one one four. Q No water particularly driveways and we use those values. In our calculations. This formula. You have seen before. We fill in here. The values for A and B.. For slap. And now. We're going to rearrange this equation. And also make the drying time. Explicit. So we can actually calculate the drying time. In the end. So if. First do is switch. Eight. Divided By be square. To the left side. Next. Every day there were double resume on both sides. So the exponent will disappear. Then we are going to fill in for Yeah a number. And we also are going to remove this minus. By just. Swapping these terms. As a left site. And then. Review rife. Final expression. For the drying time during the following great periods. And if we didn't fill in all the values that we fall into before. Then we arrive at a total drying time. During the following rate period. Of almost forty eight hours. Which is much longer than during the concentrates period. But we should realize that here doing this. Part of the drying process is diffusion limited. And if you say fifty is much lower than. During you going to concentrate period where the drying. Is extern and. Really limiting. Also. Maybe I did not explain that. Here. Explicitly. But the temperature of a product. Should be forty degrees and. Also the air temperature. Is forty degrees. So we do not use here anymore. The temperature of the front at thirty six degrees. But of forty degrees. To rife. At destroying time. So concluding for a constant rate period. We use hold air around two hundred thirty six degrees. Without the product getting warmer than forty degrees. And we arrive at the drying time of. About three hours. For the falling rate period. We use. Cold air temperature of forty degrees. Because if we would use a higher temperature than our product would heat up to this higher temperature which leads to an desired. Defects of the product. And then we arrive at a second period. At the total time of. Fourteen hours. So if we sum those up. We have approximately. Total drying time. Of seventeen hours. Now how are we going to carry these drying out. We can use for example a tray dryer. Either a batch or continuous or trade ice system. The batch. Would be temperature probe. For example the first three hours. Operating results are offended thirty six degrees. And then the last fourteen hours using. Forty degrees hot air and all the ways they have continuous drying. When we have for example a conveyor belt or. Trucks that are transported from one's own to another zone where they had residence time. Times are controlled such that the first during the first part of the product is exposed limited to six degrees. And the second part of it's exposed to forty degrees. OK This summarizes the clip in this oldest clip. I showed you how to assess the drying times during to concentrate on the following re periods for fighting explicit. To calculate these and subsequently. I gave an example how to use these expressions. To calculate and design. The drying off. In this case. And design. For low temperature approaches for drying of tomato suffices.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I will discuss. And explain you the principles of frying. Processes. Frying is actually a peculiar type of. Drying process. As an oil. Acts as a halt. Medium. Actually the drying medium. It heats up. The fries. For example. Or other products that are being fried. And then. Extracts or. Transfers heat. Which results in your Federation. Of water from the product. To the oil. And the product. Will be dehydrated. Typically. There are several types of. Frying methods. You can distinguish methods which use a very little or thin film of. Frying oil. Techniques like Ben frying or stir frying. These types of techniques are used to fry fetch the bowls. Meat and fish is something like walk to shifts. These are typically stir fried dishes used. Especially in the kitchen. We also have. Frying methods that use shallow. Amounts or a certain amount of. Frying oil. And these products are partially submerged in the oil. For example used to fry. Portion size cuts of meat and fish and fish that for example like shrimps. Now then the most used. And that's what I actually for frying. Is a deep frying. Process. In this technique the product is completely submerged in the whole toil. And it's used for example to produce products like potato chips. French fries. That's known and. Noodles etc. Deep frying is a very popular method. And it gives a distinct taste to food. So not only dehydrates removes water. But it also gives these crispy. Texture to foods. Which makes it. Loved by many people. A very big. Application of frying. Is the manufacturing of. French fights. And I hear. You see a difficult line. Which is used for pretty frying of French fries. Fried frying. Is actually used to already give potatoes. Stripes. Some pretty frank treatment. After that. The potato stryfe are being frozen. After which they are distributed throughout the whole product. Chain. For example the two supermarkets where people buy french fries to fry them off at home or for example to fast food change. Where very fast. Products serving is decides which is perfectly suitable. Using these type of process in combination with a short. After bar frying. Dime. Now the estimated. Production of french fries is about ten million tons of product per year both white. Deep frying. Is a very suitable method for dehydration. We have because we have a very fast transfer of heat. And the oil is typically. Has a temperature. In the order of. Hundred seventy five to two hundred eighty degree Celsius and. Off the heating of the product. We have a very fast dehydration. And during the frying. Also of course will be formed which gives these difficult texture. And also. Typical taste is created by some oil take up in the product. And that's especially a curse. Actually after removing the product from the oil. We get steam coolness zation. And because of capital pressures. We circle oil. Into the pores just fright. French fry. Yes. So actually if you want to have for example a low fat fry. Then you prefer or you could see why the oil of with a napkin for example that would be as far as I would have this actually chewing drying. Is that heat is being transferred to the fry wild. In a core of the French fry. Remains relatively soft and remains at a boiling temperature. The crust. Will progressively. Increase in warts and it will heat up. To watch the oil temperature. Now you see here. That water. Migrates to watch the surface of the crust. Where it escapes. As Fabre bubbles. In the oil. And then here at the right side. You see a scanning electron microscope. Image. Where you can see this difficult. Porous. Crust which provides the scrunchie. Texture. Of this light. You can see the change. Or the progression of. Frying time. And how that affects the convective heat transfer of coffee on the outside of the fry. After a first initial. Heating period. We get it up aeration. Of steam bubbles. From the fry. During the first period. Which can be consumed if you have it can be considered as a surface boiling state or constant rate period. And we have evaporation. Of the surface moisture contents. No or. Almost or only a small. Crust is being formed. At a critical point. You have to ration rate starts to decline. And then we enter the falling. Rate stage. During this stage. More thick crust. Will be formed. And you see that these different phases. Affect the heat transfer of coffee very much. And it has to do with the amount of bubbles. That. And hence forth confection. He had a surface. Off. Friday. Which enhances the magnitude of the conflict if he thinks for goldfish and. In this light. I will do rife the. Dying for total. Frying. It is. And I love us. To freeze drying. The stary facia here. You see schematically the temperature. The temperatures that occur during the dry of doing frying at the falling rate stage. We soon did heating up and a constant rate period. Are relatively small. So we consider. We base our calculation. All of that for frying time on the basis of the fall rate period. Only. So this. We present the oil temperature. We have a small. External heat transfer. Limitation. But in most of the highest gradient. In temperature. Of course. In the dry crust. While the moist product is at the boiling. Temperature as a disease the temperature of the fry at the inner site from matching. The amount of heat. That is transferred to the amount of moisture that's evaporated. Using this expression. For the Separation of moisture. We can be rife. A total frying time. Which is equal to the initial. Moisture fraction. Multiply theta density of water multiplies with the heat of the separation. Multiplied through the square thickness. Divided by two multiplied. With the heat connectivity multiplied three the driving force forty five ratio which the temperature gradient. Difference between. The oil and. The inner core temperature. Also we can assess. Partial frying. Times. By using this. Correlation. No there is then total. Frying time. While tea. Would be an intermediate. Frying time. If you realize that in comparative. And when going comparison to freeze drying. We have here. Heat of the separation. Instead of the heat of sublimation. Then I will show you here. The state diagram for deep fry. Of fries. First we had Fost heating up. Off the fries. Towards morning temperature. And then we will start with evaporation. Of water and. The crust. Will start to increase in soul of the contents of a lot of water will be removed. And a concentration of solitude. Rapidly. Occur. And there we pause also. To start melting line. And we end up. At this point and. After removing the price. From the oil. The product. Will cool down to some degree. And past the last transmission line we have to be careful that we do not let their fries. Cool. Too much done. Because if it cools too much down. Then the question becomes too. To heart. Giving normally sired sensory properties. Also the frying process would be such that in a site of the crown of to remain soft. While the outside remains relatively. Crispy. This is different from making potato chips here. I show the same. Diagram. But then. For frying. Of potato chips. So we have more or less the same. Curves. But then we call them much more we call down more because we want to have a fully. Crispy. Product. It should not be soft. At the inside. And we cool it down to twenty degrees because after frying we are going to distribute these products. To to anywhere supermarkets and so on and so in fact this final product should be acceptable. We should be careful for example not to have two. Thick slices. Because then. For example steam pressure inside the tips. Can build up. And this can lead to place the formation. So you have expansion. Off of potato chips. Resulting in the desired product properties. Finally I show here. Some advantages of frying. It is a very efficient method. As a whole. Medium is used to remove heat. Of to transfer heat in a rapid way and to remove water Fabre it at Stacey's flavor and color. The product. It is used to prepare. Different types of. Crispy foods such as. French fries. Chips. And also vegetable or fish like products. Depending on the type of message that you use. Also all the products. Are For example fright. Just for cornucopia. Which needs repartee transfer and they expand and in that way they can expand rapidly in size. OK That brings me to the end of my knowledge clip. In this knowledge clip. I explained about frying operations which is a type of drying process. Both. Dehydrating. The product and give it in giving it a distinct taste. By the oil absorption. And giving it a crust. Which gives a nice. Crispy experience while consuming these products. Also derives its. Total time you need for frying until certain point to contain.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I will discuss. About the technique free drawing. Strong is well known for its really mild driving behavior. It is used to drive very heat sensitive products. To be extreme. For example to drying. Of living bacteria. Like fix scenes. Of probiotic bacteria. They can be dried such that are five billeted or that they survive to drying process. And that's often not the case for example when you apply a collective fair and right methods. Just first to explain you the principle of freeze drying. So this is kinetic picture of a freeze dry or wet a product. Is usually put in a tray. First before actually being dried. It is. First frozen. That the product is completely frozen and. Ice crystals formed inside the next step is that if a queue is created. While creating a fake you. We can actually arrive at such conditions that we cannot have. Evaporation. But we have sublimation. So that transition from. Ice crystals. Into water favor. This transition. Allows the drying. Of the products fire sublimation. The driving force for sublimation. Is the difference in faith and near the surface of the products and. In the Belak. Of. The drying medium. And this Faber is it sequentially transported to. Cubes where it is being condensing. As and collected as ice. During the freeze drying process. The problem. Remains at a low temperature. That the freezing of the temperature below zero degrees. Still for sublimation. We need to also provide energy. Therefore. We see the distrait. Is also implemented with electrical heating. So actually what occurs is that during. Freeze drying. So often for a freezing of the product. The product is slightly heated. To achieve. Sublimation. Because of the separation. Temperature will decrease again. As On average the temperature of the product. Will be for example around minus seven degrees. And so really providing a very mild process. One of the disadvantages of this whole process. Is that the process is very slow. So over night drying. Is typically. For this type of drying masses. This is a typical. Industry skills. Freeze dryer. You see a whole rack. Of trace. Stacked in a vacant chambre. It is a very simple process. So just that's why so. Process where all the product is stacked in wrecks. Here you see some examples of products that have been pre-split freeze dried. On the top we see. Coffee which have been pretty mailed prior to freeze dried meat or meat products like they can. Can also be very mildly fried right. And here. Even. Ice cream. And then also of the typical features of. Freeze drying. Is that the product structure. Is very much retained. And that is actually because the ice crystals. Are in fact. Escaping through sublimation. The remainder of the structure remains intact. And ice crystals affect the leaf. Space free. So that the product the final. I probably has a little high throws it. The fact that we can do freeze drying it relies on the properties of water. Here at the top right. You see the face diagram of water. As a fiction. Of the pressure. And the temperature. We can correct arise. The face. Phases of water. So we have the ice face the sort of face we have the water. The liquid face. And the water Fabre face. And the lines. Reflect the face Francis shoots. So at this Earth. We have this sublimation. Or compensation. Line here. We have. Evaporation going from liquid to vapor. Of conversation. And here we have the melting. Or freezing line. Then we have one. Very nice triple point where the tree phases co-exist. And then typically freeze dry and processes. Operate at fairly low pressure as you see. And. Temperatures of. Minus forty. And during drying. Somewhat higher. That in forty degrees would be minus forty degrees would be the initial. Temperature. So we make use of this transition between solar and Faber. And one of the Vanities is for example that. Also a romance are very much retained in a product. Because of the low vapor precious of a real mass at these low temperatures. What is often. Also freeze drying used for. Is to drying off vegetables. And here you see an example of. The drying. Of broccoli. We could make here a comparison between the drying of broccoli using. Atmospheric growing discotheque to add right. And freeze drying. And then we examine in more detail. What a defect of the free drying process. On structure. And then. Typically we need to keep for example him or we can take in mind. Is that if we. Dr product we want to reconstitute it for example to make up an instant soup and. Two rifles with a product which gives the original characteristics of the broccoli. While making our soup. Then we can use advanced techniques to correct Rice the prosody for example of dry product. We see here. At the top. Scanning electron microscope images. And here. X. rays. Demography pictures. It's right the mother feet would be censored three D.. Picture of the structure. And the same to the pictures that we can actually see here. The left are to freeze dried structures. At the right. Advice structures. Typically. For freeze dried festivals and also broccoli. We see a very porous structure. And that is because the ice crystals leave space behind them. After said the Masons are creating a very porous more like structure. We have the air dried broccoli. And that structure very much collapsed. So we get a very dense structure. Also we can do that for. Carrots. And so here. We also are going to examine what is there I really had ration property. So here on the left. We see again freeze dried product. On the right. We see here. The air dried carrots. Products. And what we see is that the structure. Is very well preserved. Using freeze dry. We have a poor us. Nicely still lot structure. Arguing convective add Ryan the structure of the carriage collapsed. Upon the rehydration. We also see that. The carriage will expand. While the collective air drives coverage really needs a lot of time to expand. We only we had waited here for five minutes. But I guess. You don't want to. Wait much longer for example. But still it is not swollen. Anymore to its full. Original volume. We should also keep in mind that it's not per se. Always effective to have these type of course tricky because the sensory properties. May also be different than the original structure. Because the purpose of the is not the original prosecute it is rated by the ice crystals. And sometimes these type of structures are rather spongy So when you bite on them. You squeeze out the moisture and it doesn't always give a desired. Taste. Experience. So it's not necessary that it's structure although it looks nicer. Is better in terms of sensory properties. So. Drying up or fight a good person facial of the product shape. That's always well suitable for drying out to fetch the balls and fruits. And the flavors are full of Tycho Mint components are well. Retained in a product. Because of the low. Favor pressure of these components at the low temperatures. And ice crystals are a temptation is to create the art to provide ferocity and Dana original size. But sometimes they may also damage the structure by picturing the walls depending on their size. There is FOS that sense of properties. May be different. And then it's also good to realize that of course. Frees drawings a very mild. Process. But it also has disadvantages in the sense that it's a better process. The drying times are extensive and also it is very energy consuming and high capital cost technique. It's not only that you need to freeze the product. But you also need to create the fake him and all that all together and make sure the very high energy consumption of this technique. Then we can also visualize the freeze drying in a state diagram. Freezing. Of the product. We decrease. The temperature of. Probably from ancient. Till I see zero degrees. I disappoint you will create. Ice crystals. I will hand the remainder of the products will become also sold at some point. And then we start to apply this. Supply heat. And then. The remainder of the product will increase in concentration. To some point at which. We will have a glossy. State of the product and. Drying becomes more and more difficult. But in each case. Also to emphasize is that still heating is necessary to actually achieve sublimation and this removal of moisture from the product. This is a typical. Drying curve for freeze drying. So here we have the temperature on the Y. axis and amount of content on the X. axis. So we start from if I hire more of the content. I gradually decrease. You see that a temperature remains more or less at minus seven degrees. While at the end of the drying. We see that we need to increase the product temperature. And it probably temperature will cheat more Indian conditions. And so it is a risk that for example the product size melting which is not. Desired. You also see here the glass transition. Line. By passing across. Translation line drawing will become exceedingly more difficult. Now. I will explain a little bit more about how to do arrive. The drying time. For free drying process. And here we assume that the process. Is heat transfer limited. And so. Actually we start off with. Humane deaths our freeze frames are drying front and proceeds into the products. L.T. also assume. Is that the heat. That is transferred. Also is. Transforms all in Morsi separation. This is typically a schematic picture. Where we supply heat from the outside. To the product. And we see a temperature gradient. External temperature gradient and temperature gradient. Across the dry layer. Which is the largest So there is the most resistance to what what he thinks for and. Into frozen product. We have a flat profile. Now we can then. Describe the heat transfer limited process. Drying process by this equation. Where the amount of water evaporated. Is equal to the amount of heat transfer. And then you should remember that. The driving force for driving here for heat transfer. Is a temperature difference. At the outside of the product minus. The freezing temperature here. Also please note that. ANTAL P.. Is the entropy here. Sublimation. And not to the entropy of evaporation. Well the furred are going to assume that the external. Heat transfer corporation is rather high. Therefore we can neglect this through. Which makes life a little bit easier. And we can rearrange an integrated formula. To obtain the drying time. So this is the integration. And so we integrate. From one minus X.. From time zero until. Time T.. On the right hand side. And we do the same the den from time serial until time Misty to obtain. The drying time. Then we realize that we that takes three percent of the fraction of wet product. And one minus X. this. The fraction of product that has been dropped on the next light. I show you do zilch. Of the integration. At D.S.T.. We don't find this equation. That the temperature is equal to the initial. Monster fraction multiply feasted density of water. Most applies with the heat of. Sublimation multiplied with a square thickness. Defied by two times the conflictive city. Multiply the temperature difference. Multiply vs my. One minus X. squared. We can also integrate into all the total. Drying time. And then we obtain this. Correlation. That's all missing. The one minus exquisite. We can actually use these two expressions to do right. An expression or correlate the. Time versus. The total drying time. And then we can also assess. Into media it's drying times. For example for drying. Until a certain amount or percentage of dry products. So for example. If we try the product for ninety percent. Then the remainder of the product. The wet product is zero point one. Therefore one minus X. is zero point nine. And we can then state. That the time for drawing until we achieve. Ninety percent by product. Is equal to eighty one percent. Times. The total drying time. So that indicates that the further you proceed in the drawing process. The slower it gets. Just to remind you. The heat of sublimation. Is two thousand eight hundred thirty eight kids are picky the ice and. The value of the sea. Depends on your. How you apply the heat to your product. It can be the whole flavor think this or in this case we supply heat from both sides. But if the product is positioned on top of the tray. And the heat only. Penetrates from one side. Then we use the full. Layer thickness. Now having said this. I would like to read up his knowledge clip. On freeze drying. And in this knowledge clip I introduced a very mild freeze drying methods which uses. The sublimation. Of ice to vapor. To dry a product. Freeze dry and provides very porous. Foods. Very high quality. But at the expense of high energy costs. And also the capital costs. Are relatively high. So it is a nice technology for for drying up very mild. High valuable. Products. Finally I derived. Some equations which you can use. To assess the drying time during free trying.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I will discuss. The principle of drum driving drunk driving is a contact drying method. It is an alternative for invective ad right. While. Convective ad right. Is a mainstream driving technology driven drying. Dressing for specific applications is one of the methods used for contact drying your income to growing the product. Is placed as it didn't fill all the surface. The surface. Convicts. The heat from another. Drying medium. That is deep in this case not air. But it usually holds air. Holds water or steam. For example we have perfect as we know dry bread a product. Spread on the surface of a plastic fall. And beneath the fall. There's hold water. This holds water conduct heat. Through the film to the product. If that is of reference as we know drives also that radiative transfer. That's up to the total heat transfer. Making this process. An interesting. Method to also more mildly dry food drink drying other. Contact drying methods. Which is very. It's a very old technique in fact already used. Since the one nine hundred. But since that time very much a date is and. Here you see an example of a drum dryer doing drum drying the product is cost us or ports. On a rotating drum. And a Dr Phil. Is OP date. The advantage of contact drying methods. Is that these methods are very efficient much more efficient. Then. Direct drying. Switches. Convective ad writing you can think about. It's gain and energy efficiency of. Forty percent hot water or steam. Can provide heat. At little disadvantage. Is that the product. Will become hotter. So. Usually a product of. That's a lower quality in terms of thermal degradation for example update. And that is because the product is not derived directly dried at about Bill temperature. As for example for spray drying. But right. To watch the. Drying temperature of the surface. So driven drying is a very wildly used. Drying technology. Well for example the fact this window drying. Is still in its development faced. So I will focus from now on on from drawing room drawings start with a rotating drum. This is the drum wall. It usually made of iron. We have a knife. That scrapes off the product. And the drum. Rotates continuously. From the inside. There is a steam supply. And a product is set at the top. And water. Is evaporated and. During the evaporation of water. The product will dry and. Become more drier. The temperature will indeed increase to the temperature of the drum more. And here. At this site. The product will be scraped off. Film will be obtained. And his film. Can be milled. Into smaller particles or flakes. Which can then be used as the final product. We have different types of dryers. We have the so-called. Three drum dryers for double drill drives. Or a single drum drives the double drum drives have a valid fifty low capacity. But are very suitable for drying low fiscus products. And also products. For example where it is impressing to have a. Bit of caramelized. Product. For some of those could be attractive for example for. Dried milk powder. To make chocolate milk. That is usually done. Using these double. Run dry. Not typical. Product examples are melech. Way like toast and yield yeast. And the other side. We have the single drum dryer. The single drum dryer. Is very suitable to drive more fiscus products. Based for example. They are also often forced applicator rolls. Used to actually keep the product. Well. Stick to the drum will. Not this type of from dries. A typically used for baby food. Right of potato. Fruit and vegetables gelatine. Starch more pastry like products. This is a dream drier part of the kill operation. And these pictures. Originate from the company of the child up. Here you see a drum dryer. The film. Comes out. And we have also a few moment. To actually remove the vapor that arises from the product. And often. Also some blowing. Is applied to actually a void any muscles for limitations. And yet a surface of the product. Here we can actually see the film coming out in so much more detail. That breaks up into small particles. I finally we have flakes. But that can also be further by reducing size. By milling. Now then we go a little bit more deaths. On the drum drying. And we are going to correct the rise of the drum drying process. In terms of. Drying time. And therefore we need to know that broom drying consists of several stages. First we heat up the product. To the boiling temperature. And when the product of boiling temperature. The product starts to dry because water is evaporating. I did point. The product will slowly dry. Until the complete. Product layer is dry at a boiling temperature. And as soon as a product is dry. Then it will heat up further to the surface of the drum temperature. If deceit supply is too high then. We have irregular boiling behavior. And this can result in ideal behavior and. Product which is not dry properly. So therefore usually teen films are polite to a la Foster if that peroration. And also allows. Evaporation and drying. Within a time to the short of then the rotation. Time for the film. So if we look in more detail to the drying. We can see here a disk image picture. So at the left you see the drum wall. The temperature of the steam. Here at the top. There's. Heat conduction to the drum will. Then if you arrive at the temperature of the Dremel. On the outside. Then we have a dry layer which increases in size and it will be temperature difference across this layer. It actually acts as an insulator. It's not a fellow very well. Conduct with. Which is different from the surface Larry which is still wet. And so the dry layer will expand in time. And if APRA bubbles. Will be transported through this Larry. And then be emitted into the air and throughout the process. To dry later. Layer will increase in size and its Larry layer will decrease. This process. And be correct arised as he tries for a limited process. And we need to take into account heat transfer through the Dremel and. Through the. Dry layer. So we do that now so the amount of heat transfer that is equal to the heat transfer coefficient multiplies with a driving. Force for drying. Which is a temper to difference. It's the out of sight of the dry. Layer which is the boiling temperature. Minus the temperature of the steam this point. Heat transfer of course. Is built up out of two parts. We have to heat transfer. Across the Dremel. With the thickness of the Dremel and the connectivity of the people. Plus the heat transfer. Over sent across the dry layer. Were set is the size of the dry layer. And lambda. Is the connectivity. Of the product. The dry product. Now we can also define the rate of drying. And that is expressed by M. dots and that is proportional to the initial. Volume fraction of water. Multiplied with the density of water multiplied meter. Total thickness of the layer. Multiplied with the gradient the change of product layer. In time. Order. The fraction of wet product in time. So at the beginning. It is one. The product is completely wet. While to watch the end of the. Drying time. Explore approximate B. be zero. Now this. Fraction can actually be correlated to the thickness of the dry layer. Fired this expression whereas it is equal to the total thickness layer multiplied with Mark one minus. It's not then that the amount of evaporated water. Equals the amount of he transferred. That's a cue the amount he transferred multiplied with the mass of the separated water. Multiplied. With the heat of. Evaporation. We used this equation. We fill in the previous equations so this is going in here. And Q. is replaced by this expression. Then we. This expression. Which is a quite extensive expression. That we can integrate this expression. To obtain the final. Drying time during during dry. And then. We need to integrate. From the product and be completely wet. To completely dry. And so that means from. Well minus six zero to one minus it's as well and is used to total drying time for drying. That's being described by DISH equation. Having. Heat transfer called Fish and find I.D.'s. Equation. This equation we can use to correct Rice the drying time during the drawing here. Have some more explanation or different parameters. Where deceases thickness of the thin layer. This. Parameter stands for the volume fraction of the density of water so though the temperature. D S of the steam or steam condense on the inside of the drum. The boarding temperature. And this is the total expression. Then it's good to realize that of course with higher temperature difference. The drying time. Will. With a higher temperature at the steam site that time. Will decrease. As if we did fight. By a larger temperature difference. Also what we should realize is that if we make more thick layers that the. Drying time also decrease very much. And actually this correlation. Can be derived. So if the. Drying time. Of the bigness of the product increases with effect the two. Then the drying time will increase would affect the four to beat it in an equation because D.C. is here. And we defied by the inverse of D.C. So would. Eventually we say that. T. He noted T. is proportional to the square. Squared. Thickness of the product. Finally I will defer short comparison between dream drawing and spray drawing in terms of product quality. This column. We see some properties for sprayed by powders and. The right call and we see some properties of them right. About the particle structure is completely different. Well for spray drying. We have. Particles or agglomerate. With Eric Lucian's. The drum dry powder. Is very early. Very compact and no Arab group in group inclusions. We have more flakes like. Particles which can be mailed. The bottle surface for sprayed out bodies of August moves. While we have irregular particles for drip dry powder. The particle size sprayed about us is usually very small the primary. Although a glowing writes can be formed. Which is not possible for drums right about us. Their size can be joined by milling. The heat out during them drying is usually higher. So we focus on for more protein units ration. Leading to more pure shit. So you ability. While for spray drying. It is very mild because the drying occurs at the wet built temperature in first instance. As so that's very suitable for heat sensitive products for some products. For example if you want to make milk powder for chocolate. Application. Then it's interesting to have government is ation so then drilled right now about it can be. Had an interesting possibility. Also having an energy efficiency of forty percent. So there's not a lot of prodding during spray drying which is logical. At the low. Relatively low temperatures in that process. So revving up now. During this knowledge clip. You learnt about contacts drying methods and specifically about drum drying. I showed you how. Drawing is carried out the principle of doing dry. And also how you can do calculations on drying times during Dreamtime Finally I showed you the difference between spray drying and RIM drying. In terms of political nitty.",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this first clip on factorial an over. Let me show you in a minute or we going to do. So we have five. Clips for you the first clip is an introduction into factorial I know from before or the clips will follow. And we look at the example of the taste of tomatoes that we have seen in one way and of. I hope you remember that the response for why was the sweet taste of the tomatoes in there were three types of tomatoes be share your ground tomatoes. And the question is whether they have the same sweet taste. Now. There is a second factor involved heed which is the ripening duration of the tomatoes. Which could be long or short. You see this extra column and. So I use long and short for writing how to study the effects of generation and type of tomato on sweet as together. Well. How can we do that. Well better not perform. Two separate studies. Meaning. To separate one win over us. But instead use an exploring effect royal treatment structure with. Crossed. Experimental affect us. So we have six treatments which are the combinations of the three levels of effect it's a major type and. Two levels of factor right. So schematically we have this we have the three types of tomato we have. Long duration short duration. And per combination to our two tomato. Tomatoes tasted good founded use of such an approach would be that. We can have an impression of the interaction meaning. Do we see the same effect of the generation for all the types of tomatoes. And we have more degrees of freedom to estimate the research will vary. If we want to analyze data from with such a structure. Well the initial start could be just a combined effect this type of IP to. Single factor. With six levels. So we have a single factor with levels be long before George. Sherry long very short settle. It just one way I know far. So we can fit. One way I know for a model. New post or I like we did in week one. And that's what actually is being done here in our. So we. We form a new factor see aff which is a combination of typing of arrived. And we put it here as a defector into one of the you know from old. He was you know for travel. And from the F. test we had to prevail you equal to point zero three you conclude there are significant differences between the six treatments and. After the leftist. You probably want to do paralyze comparisons of treatment combinations that Katrin says be done with the package Agricola a. Which has a function of the doc test. It keeps you. The least significant difference. Which is equal to twenty meaning that if a difference between two groups. Is larger than twenty. You would call it significant. This also a letter display of the order treatments. Mean Stelling you. Which groups are significantly different and second thoughts. There is a better way of analyzing these data. In the one we are no five. We get a single. Treatment sum of squares as this T. which is equal to. Nine hundred ninety point six. Measuring the combined effect of. Type and ripen taste. But it our first no impression of interaction is the interaction between type arrived. Well if the effect of ripe and sweet taste. Is the same put a flea to make the types. Interaction is not needed. And the model would be simplified. That would be an application of what's called the principle of presumably with stealth that. You should keep the model as simple as possible the attitude captured the essence. Pursue money is also called Ockham's Razor. For fishes ation of interaction. You may make a profile plot. And what's a profile plot well for profit plot you need to sell means. The means of the sweet taste in the six combined. Combined groups. And you. Plot those means. In a sketch a plot. Where you half on the Y. axis the mean taste and indeed Texas the three tomato types. And you connect means at a common level of ripe. And here we see that these two patterns run. Approximately parallel. And which tells us that this model may be simplified. Probably we don't need interaction here. OK let's switch to a second example is an example about the attention span of children. So the response variable is the length of time that a television commercial can hold a child's attention. And ought to set this in full for the first factories the H. class with three different levels children from five to six seven to eight or nine to ten years old and the second factor is the topic of the commercial of could either be a breakfast cereal or a federal crime. And for each age group who are twenty five percent of children chosen randomly assigned to one of the two commercials. There's a slight complication here. Some children would. Were withdrawn from the study. And leaving an unbalanced the sign meaning that we do not have the same number of observations in all the groups. Ok for. If we want to make a profile plot for attention span we need to means as before and we plot them here. And what we see here that if children get older the difference in time spent between the products increases. The youngest children there's hardly a difference between the two. But all the children the difference is increasing. This means that factors A and B. interact. And the difference in the mean response between levels will be. Are not the same across the levels of A and vice versa. So in this case. A model with the combined effect this can not be simplified. So we. We need to to way I know for a model with interaction. In this last case. We can ride. Down such a model in two ways we can use means model notation. Where the systematic part of the model just says mew R.J.. Telling you that. Each group has its own mean. In this case there is no for total structures just one we don't know for situation. All we can write down effect. The model. In the infinite sets model notation and. The systematic bodies mucosa of I post B. digit was self would be digesting this parameter Alpha B. to R.J.. It's an interaction term. It's like a correction. On top often at this part and you Purcell floppers B. Did you search. That the effect effect or. A may differ. Different levels for it to be OK if we use this effect small alteration the interaction is explicit. So death row. We can. Before my hypothesis test to see whether the model can be simplified. Meaning that those interaction. Parameters are close to zero. If interaction is not need it. We can remove it from the model and we would arrive at the what's called an additive model where the system as a part it is mucosal five percent A-J. and if such an additive model applies for tomatoes. And the effect of ripe is the same for the three types of tomato. So there's no need to re part. Report. Derived effect separately for each type. And likewise. The differences between the types. Do not have to be reported separately for long or short dropping duration. So if you have an additive model the presentation of the risk. It becomes much easier. And incidentally here. Needs are just all linear models that we have to well known set of assumptions to be checked. Independent and. Normal distribution with mean zero. And constant variance. What will follow in next clips on factorial no farm. Will be more about two way and over with and without interaction. We will discuss them so squares into a No five and the corresponding after. We will look at pairwise comparisons between relevant means. And in the final clip we will look at some experimental e signs and I know far. Completely random I see signs and random icicle pre-book is on. Summary. In effect Oriel No five the effects of crossed factors. On a response for Bill. Are analyze simultaneously. Interaction. Effect this. A and B.. Mean that are you affected factor. Under responses. Different different levels affect to be. And a two way I know for a model with interaction. Can be written in this way with a systematic part. Consists of you. I was B.J. Brazil who died. And this is the medic. Part tells in a rather complex way that. Each combination effect the levels has its own mean. You R.J. a pro for politics useful to visualize Fisher lies in direction. If the effect of a factor is the same at all the levels of it to be. Interaction may be removed and. An additive model. May be used at that model. They've written this way. Where we just saw it but it just made a particle system new and such an additive model greatly simplifies the conclusions. Thanks for your attention and see you in next clip.\n",

                "text": "Logan welcome to this final clip on Uncle phone. Let me show you in a map where we are. So we have seen all the examples for different requestion line we looked at and go from the narrow sense. And finally. We want to check the assumptions in one call find a narrow sense. Well and I go for model is just this parallel lines model it's an example of a linear model so we have the usual linear model assumption for the heiress. Independence. A normal distribution with mean zero. And constant variance and. Use assumptions can be checked in the usual way. In the way we did for instance a regression. We have a few extra checks to make in one call far. We want to check. The linearity of the relationship between the coffee area in the mean response. We want to check whether we have parallel lines by the we indeed have the same linear relationship for all the factor levels. And we would like to look at the appropriateness of the correction medical favorite at all so the first thing to check is the linearity of the relationship. Of the Gulf area. With the mean response. We issue but there is this trade lie relationship that. A simple check. Now could be. To to square off the coffee area to the model and then inspect the coefficient of the square if we do that in this example of skill or we add the square. Of the center of Fareed over there. And we inspect the. Coefficient. Point zero one it is here really squares estimate as to the question coefficient. The T. test is performed in the P. value is. Point zero four seven so small a five percent so. We are rejecting here to no hypothesis that its coefficient is equal to zero so this seems to be some curvature that could be due to some influential point it needs further study. The second thing to check. Is the assumption that. We have parallel lives that. That we have to eat. Cool slopes in the different groups. Well we have a very nice way to check that. We have to have test to compare a fool and a reduced model. So the full model would be the model. With different slopes. So each group will have its own slope. And the reduced model is the paralyzed model that's your call for a model. So here. It's done in our model is the model where we allow for interaction between a cough area the defect or the reduced moralist actual on call for model the parallel lines model. With the end of the function we compare the two P. values points thirty six. Larger death five percent so did is no indication that slopes a different way and the finally should a correction for the coffee area to be made at all. Well a few points to make here. If the coffee area it is includes. By the tree. And then. Correction for the coffee area may unwillingly remove part of the relationship of the treatment and response. Another thing. Correction for the Gulf area. May erroneously rely on extrapolation of regression lines. When the Gulf area to tell you so ferry different between the groups. For instance You Tube or city design or. Due to some unfortunate configuration. In an observational study. They should be sufficient. Overlap in call favorite. Values between the groups. Last point a correction for the Gulf area to make create and realistic. Just means for some groups when a fair bit to tell us. Defer systematically between groups in your line population. For instance if you want to compare mills and females. You probably do not want to correct. To a common fell you for. Initial body weight. The way to check these things well rather simple you could make some graphs you can. Side by side box plot of the Gulf area where you make a scatterplot of the response first the Gulf area with different potting symbols for the treatment groups. Let's look at the few examples. So first example on peonage you. Remembered it was an experimental study on the effect of fertilizers and the call fair it was the initial plan to hide. Measured before treatment was a side that's important. And it was measured before the treatment was unsigned. Assigned and therefore it cannot be influenced by the treatment. Well it's safe to use disco faery it to use this as a favorite. If there is sufficient overlap and here in the side by side book Blood. You see that there is sufficient overlap. Indeed to this five second example the skill of children with some of the facial study under differences between social classes and a possible favorite is the age of the child. Well age is not influenced by social class so therefore it's safe to use a Soko favorite if there is sufficient overlap. Look at the side by side book spot. Indeed there is sufficient overlap in H. values between the different social classes. Now I have two questions for you. And suppose now in the peanut field. Example that. The plant was not. Was measured. A week after the start of the experiment and in the furbelows sation skill example. What if the. Age was not measured at the beginning of the study. But that Yant. Think about it for the clip for a moment and then return. OK. Welcome back. Here are a few answers to these questions. So first a question about plant hired suppose planted was measured. A week after the start of the experiment. And that case the plant will likely be influenced by the. The print and. Correction for Pontypridd remove part of the treatment effect and penis yield. Which is not what you want. So don't use this measure or fight a circle fer it any further say should collect sample. Suppose H. was not measured at the beginning of the study. But if you can't. Well. Age. Child is of course not influenced by social class. And it is really irrelevant when we age is measured. As long as it is measured at the same moment for all the children. So age should Yant. Might be used as a go favorite. Given that there is enough overlap between the different classes. A few more remarks about and realistic adjusted mean so be careful when the. Treatments cannot be assigned randomly like genders smoking social class for vital. And the car ferry decks may systematically. Differ between treatment groups and. Because A Just that means are predictions at an overall mean. X. bar. And it's all for all. Mean X. bar maybe and realistically a lot for some groups and unrealistically small for other groups. You're just that means maybe unrealistic. So this is a rather extreme example where there are three groups. And of course favorite failures are completely different into three different groups. What would be a just a treatment means here. Well. Just a treatment beans are predicted means. At the various sell you will Bill. Will be here in the middle. And in this example. We had just a treatment. Means will be will be approximately the same. In summary. And I cover model is a linear model. And therefore the errors are issue to be independent and normally distributed. With mean zero. Constant variance. You can use the usual checks. And you can make extra checks for the linearity of the relationship of between the cough. Once and. Check for curvature by adding the square of the coffee every two to model equality. Slopes. The different groups. Can be checked by comparing the full model with different slope for the reduced model. With their alliance for the next test. Your property of the correction medical faery it. Well generally do not correct. If the gulf area it is influenced by the treatment so that part of the treatment effect on the response. May inadvertently be removed. Don't correct for call faery it if the cough area. Values have no overlap between the treatments. And correction would be based on tricky extrapolation of regression lives. Off area to sell use. Defaces the magically between treatments in a population and in that case. Using at the sickle Fed would lead to any realistic. Adjusted means. For some treatment groups. This was the last clip in the series about the new models. Thanks for your attention.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this clip on on call fine a narrow sense. Let me show you where we are. So we've seen a number of examples of linear models where we have more than one regression lines. Parallel lines different slopes etc. And now we're over here and Co find in there a sense. Well recall that analysis of course famous in a narrow sense means that you're interested in the comparison of treatment groups while correcting for one or more coffee areas with a pair of alliance model. And call find a wide sense just refers to a linear model school pricing both go fairly it's effect us. So here we focus on Uncle front and there was sense we want to compare treatment groups. So let's take once again the. Peanut shield example. So the response for why is the peanuts each killed. And there are three types of fertilizers used standard. Fertilizer slow release of fossil is fertilizer and it is an extra variable X. which is the height of the plant at the start of the experiment. The question now is are dippin it yields different. For the three types of fertilizer. Well first a simple approach would be. Ignore for blacks completely. Use one way and so we are back in week one. So here is a marker to do the one where you are no five at the top here. Some descriptive statistics in the soup groups for the different fertilizers like mean standard deviations of calculated using the package do by which is handy for that. Situation here the way I know for model is fitted no for table is obtained. And here. The coefficients are shown. So. To look at a few details here is the researcher so much Chris seven point eleven. History said to Harry NS point two six three in the square root of it standard deviation point five one. The F. test here. Shows highly significant results. Very small piece you. And here we have to piece all use for the T. test comparing the cost in a slow release fertilizers with the control. Can we do better. Well. We can. We want to include Co Fareed X. in the model. And the reason for that is is that if you look at a fair ability of the yield. Around each line. You see that his her ability over here is much much smaller than the ability to yield ignoring the X.. And not even that. We have something as extra they'd be the height. Actually the height of the pants is an evenly distributed over the fertilizers and. For instance in this fashion these fertilizers. It seems that we have slightly larger plants so it. It would favor some fertilizers over us therefore we want to correct for the call fair it acts and we use on call for that. So the main question is is the peanut yield different among the third Lysis treatments but corrected for initial plant hide. We use a paralyzed model for that. Here is the parallel lines model. And the cough area. That is in is put into the model is the. Which is actually the center to center the Confederates so usually call favorites assented. Meaning that you just subtract the mean. Which is fifty. In this case. Well to go through the different parameters so we have to parameter B. to zero which is the mean deals. For the control fertiliser at the Efrat plant height of fifty. The top parameters are differences in mean deal between the fertilizer. F. and S. and the control fertiliser and be to what is the common slope here the ankle for model is fitted using the linear function in R.. And let's compare the. The results from the one we are know for that we've seen before now with the results from the uncle farm. Here is the research you so much Chris from I know for certain but eleven. And now India. Call for its point forty two much much lower standard deviation in one way and Alpha was point fifty one. And now it is the square root of point sixteen point thirteen. Much much lower once again so we see that a large part of the rich said you off area ration in one way or Nova. Can be explained by the coffee area it acts and. Therefore on call for office more accurate comparison. Of the types of fertilizer. Be careful if you use. No fascination here in our. I know if I gave C. quenches some sort squares. So you must be sure that the. Sector. Asked and this the model. After the coffee it. An alternative function would be drop one. So we've fit here a parallel lines model and. From the least ques estimates of the coefficients over here we can construct a three week question lines. In the control group. The line. The. It looks like this. But we have twelve point three one for us the intercept. Plus point zero five six times. X. minus fifty. In the fast release group. We have an extra. Minus three point one four for forty intercept. So to get at the hoops. That gives an intercept. Equal to nine point seventeen and in the slow release group. We have this extra three point five seven. Giving and. Into sceptical to fifteen point eight six. These are three intercepts that we have over here are called. The adjusted. Treat. It means. And the just the treatment means are estimated treatment means at the effort. Value of the CO favorite spot. If the X.. Center. Then the just the treatment means are just because you have post to all I had. If X. would not be centered. We have to fill in X. bar here. And B. this year I have posted. So I had be to one had times as Bob would be just a treatment me if we compare the ordinary treatment means with the adjusted treatment means from your call far we see some differences. For instance focusing on the fast relief group we see. Just the treatment means Nonpoint seventeen. Where in the ordinary treatment mean is nine point forty one. So quite a bit lower and why is that. Well if you look at the schedule both here and we already noticed that earlier in the fast release group. Plants tend to be a bit higher. But it just a treatment mean gives us and me at the efforts value of the coffee area. X. which is smaller than the mean of the cough area for the fashion release group and therefore. You just a treatment mean is lower than ordinary treatment. After the after as you probably would like to do pairwise comparisons between you just a treatment means. And that can nicely. Be done with the function LS means from the. LS means package and. It gives here. Once again just a treatment means and here to pair was comparisons are tied. Let's go to another example. That we've seen before the example of herbalists H.'s skills. This is an observational study. And actually children from for social economic classes at various ages. So the response wise the fertilization skill of the here. We have the social economic. Clause which is effective with four levels. And we have X. which is the age of the child in months. And here we have the data points from the four groups. You see that there is an enormous amount of scattered here in this case the pot. Love Affair ability so let's go. Fair one way or no fun and uncalled for for this example. The objective here East. Is to compare the social economic classes with respect to the civilization skills. Of many dresses in effect and for a better comparison it may be beneficial to correct for the age. So here are the two models. When we are no far first this. Call fall where the correction is made for forty years centered age. Let's just compare a few statistics here is the research you will a sum of squares from where I know for a little bit larger for thousands from Cofa it's little bit less than three thousand four thousand. There is it your standard deviation in one way and over seven a half in one call for six point nine a bit lower again. That's interesting here is a bit higher standard error of the difference is a bit lower. Actually the differences are not so very large here. If we compared ordinary. Means with the adjusted. Treatment means here we also see that there are differences are quite small. So in this example one CULVER. Is not very beneficial it gives you. Slightly smaller. Standard errors. And slightly smaller people use in summary unco find a narrow sense compress treatments correcting for the Gulf area that. The parallel lines model. Compared to an over. Part of the residual fermions is explained by the Gulf area. Typically yielding smaller ever smaller standard Airbus. A Just a treatment means are estimated treatment means that efforts failure of the Gulf area that they're. Corrected for unequivocal favorite means in the treatment groups. Thanks for your attention. And see you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello. Today I'd like to tell you something about measures of population health. Two important ones are life expectancy. And we calculate them from the life tables and this is what I'd like to explain to you. So if we look at life expectancy. I think you know what it can mean. You use this phrase quite often. But for many it's the length of the life of a hypothetical Coalwood born in a particular year. It's hypothetical. So it's not existing. And we say to born in a particular year. Let's say. All babies born in two thousand and fourteen. For example. In the Netherlands. If we want to make this projection into a life expectancy we issue in that the current mortality rates. Will continue. And that's often not the case as we noted. Generally we see an improved improvement but sometimes. In the case of HIV AIDS in some countries. We see a steep decline in current. Increase in parental Teletoon rates. Affect in effect it uses a summary of all. Age specific mortality rates and. Remember it's not influenced by the age distribution of the population so that's why we can easily compare different countries. And that's what. Done here. Data from your post that looking at the life expectancy at birth. Starting in one thousand nine hundred eighty and. Adding it up for every year until two thousand and seven I guess. For various European countries. And the average for the E.U.. In front of twenty seven countries and we see a quite low life expectancy here in the yellow and blue lines I think it's Hungary in Romania. Are higher ones in Norway and Switzerland and also the Netherlands is quite high. So you see a general trend. Of increasing life expectancy. Since one thousand nine hundred. And here we see a dip in Estonia. Let's think about how to explain this I don't know that now for sure. But you don't need to start at birth it's also of interest in thinking about the aging of our populations to look at the life expectancy starting at sixty five years of age. That's from the same source. And we see here again some country slow. Starting at twelve and a half or. Seventeen in here in one nine hundred eighty. But also a steep increase in life expectancy for elderly people. Starting at age sixty five. So if you live in two thousand and seven. The most you. Let's say. Longevity is can be found in certain countries stand at age sixty five you still have a life expectancy of more than twenty years. Which means that you can turn. Eighty five or higher. Which is nice compared to one hundred years ago. How do we calculated well we use here. A Simple Life Table we call this a life table and. The design of the lipid. Life Table is always the same. Also later in survival analysis. So we have a column. A negating the age eight you get the grease. If we each category we have the probability of dying. In this age category. So the age specific mortality rates. I mean let's say we take a hypothetical cold war. Starting with hundred thousand people. And then we get this. Mortality rate. Multiply it by. Amount of people who are in the cohort and then you know how many deaths there are. You see this in this column. So in the first age category we had nine hundred thirty nine. Expected. Death. Only twelve. Babies of one year. A fourteen etc etc. So the probability of dying between. Age. X. and expose one. Multiplied by the number of people surviving. Until this age. Gives you the number of dying. Between X. and expose one. And this is important because we also need to calculate the number of people surviving. Until the next age category. And this is simply. Subtracting. This from each other so after one year. We have still one thousand nine thousand. Sixty. One. People in our cold war. And it goes down with. Age As you can imagine. Now we also look at the person years lived. Between the age. As and the different. Time intervals. So end. Is the length of the time interval. And this is a tricky thing. Because it's not simply. This nine nine zero six one. Because what we think we had we realized that. We don't know exactly where in this time interval. These mortality. These deaths occur. And for simplicity. We always assume that all these deaths occur. Half way the time interval. So that's why we calculate and divide this number of deaths. By two. So a person years. Lived between the ages. Is the one hundred thousand times one year because in this age. Try to cure only live one year. But we don't use the one hundred thousand. We use less because people died. And we take this on average as the half of this number who died. And subtracted. So weak. At the end. Become at ninety nine thousand five hundred thirty one person years. In this first one year time interval. That's a tricky thing but that's an important thing. Then in the end. Haha do we come at the total number of years lived. Well we just have to fill this table in. Until let's say age category one hundred years. And then we calculate. And some. All the person years really is. In each one year time interval. And we end up for this hypothetical cold war. At more than seven million person years. Lived by this hypothetical cohort. Which all depends of course on this age. Specific mortality rate. Mind you. So at the end. We know how many person years there were seven. More than seven million. Seven point two mil. Again. And then how do you calculate then. The life expectancy. Well. That is then again. Again. A simple mathematical an expression because we can look at this column. Of the seven million. Person years lived. Starting at birth. And we justified it by the effect that in this category we had one hundred thousand people to start with. So to Everett's life expectancy is the. Life years expected at age. X.. Which is in this case. Zero which is seven point two million divided by one hundred thousand. Is seventy two point eight. Which is the life expectancy at birth for this. Cohort. And then. If you are one year. Your life expectancy is seven point two million something. If I did. By the number surviving. Until age. One year which was in one thousand nine thousand sixty one. And we end up with a life expectancy. Of seventy three point five. And so on and so on and so on. So your life expectancy is calculated. Dissuade. We took here an example from the Netherlands. This is data. Which we received from statistics Netherlands they had a very nice. Website with all kinds of databases we can pull up and this is the life table for the men. In two thousand and twelve and. You can see here in two thousand and twelve for men in the Netherlands life expectancy at birth. Mortality risk people alive. Numbers of deceased in the end the life expectancy at birth can be calculated to be. To be seventy nine point six years. Does this mean that life expectancy. At year. Eighty is zero no not at all. You look at year eighty. You are expected to live until you're eighty but that's an average for the total population. And of course people. Can be exceptionally fit. And live longer. So we see here at age eighty we still expect a life expectancy. Of another eight years. And this makes sense because you're already rich. Strong enough to survive until years eighty. So if you're a life. A year. Eighty. At age eighty. You still have another eighty years. Life expectancy. Ahead of you on average. Would stick. You see here on the right the plot of what we call the survival curve and we start with a hypothetical Cold War to one hundred thousand people. And you see here. The decline. The survival which is still very high and till. Age sixty or seventy. And then we see a steep decline. As we age. As you would expect. Now we can also look at something else which we think is important. If you think about public health. And that is what we think is. We can think about what if we eliminate a certain cause of death. For example diabetes or certain types of cancer. This is very simple you make a certain. Table. The same table the same life table. But then you use lower death rates. The Death Race you issue. To occur when a certain disease is not happening. And this we use often for the. Looking at the potential impact of certain interventions. Like say what. If we eliminate lung cancer. What if we eliminate cardiovascular disease. And also get an idea about the relative importance of a certain cause of death. And remember statistics Nederlands or not only. Assembles information about mortality. The mortality rate so the time of death. But also collects information on the cost of that. And that occurs in many countries. So using this information on cause of death. You can use this. To look at the cause. Elimination tables. You should realize that you cannot calculate different diseases together so you do you do this disease by. Disease. So in summary. In this clip you've seen how you can calculate life expectancy from a simple life table. And we continue with much more advanced measures. Later on.",

                "text": "Hello my name is needed for skins. And I'm one of the professors at the Division of Human a tradition in this clip I'd like to tell you something about the measures of public health impact. Why. Well. We often think that with relative risks from our evening logic studies we already know a lot. But in this case I'd like to tell you something war. And we have a reason for these. For example here is we have stroke and if we think that we find a risk factor with a risk. Of ten. For a stroke. You would think that this is a very important risk factor but this is really true I think there's something more to it and that's the topic of our. Clip. Today. What we're going to talk about is what we call attribute of the risk and things related to death and attributable risk itself. It measures the actual amount of the deceased that can be attributed to a particular exposure. In a disease or in a population that come back to that. So what you can ask yourself how much extra to cease. Occurs in the group. Compared with another group or. You can phrase the same problem as what is the excess amount of the disease or currying among those. Exposed to it certain risk factor. And the final one which we often find the most interesting one. How much of the disease. Among those who are exposed. Can we potentially prevent by remove the explosion. And in comparison. Anybody Knology in cold war story in case control studies we mostly. Talk about a relative risk. How many times higher is the risk of a disease. In one group compared to another. But this is a little bit different be frayed. And the easy thing is that you can calculate it. From the incidence rates or incidence proportions or prevalence is very simple. Because it is just. The incidence rate difference. Instance proportion difference. Or prevalence difference. And you can see. It's easily calculated to have the incidence rate in the X.. Both minus. Incidence rate in. Unexposed. Similarly for instance proportion. Similarly for prevalence. And we often call this. Excess risk. Or excess. Rate. Mostly. However I used the phrase. Risk difference. Here we have an example. Again about a stroke and we now look at smoking in female neurosis. Let's assume we have a group of never smoking. Nurses who lived in total. About four hundred thousand person years. And in this cohort. B. C. seventeen new cases of stroke. Which gives us an incidence rate of seventeen point seven or one hundred thousand person years. If we compared to smoking nurses we see a much higher incidence rate. One hundred ten thirty nine divided by two hundred eighty thousand gives us forty nine point six. As an incidence rate. By one hundred thousand to. Person years. And easily. Can be seen that the incidence rate a difference. Is just the difference between those two numbers is almost thirty to thirty one point nine. We should remind ourselves that we take this risk in the Never smokers as what we call the background. Risk or the background. Rate. So this is. So the unexposed. And it can be easily explained in this craft we see here that the incidence rate. Almost twenty. In a never smokers. And in the current smokers you see the higher incidence rate. The light blue. Gives the excess rate. The dark blue. The background grade so you see in a never smokers it's only background. Rate in the current smokers we have a background rate similar to the rate in a never smokers. And an extra. Rate. Due to the smoke. That's what we issue. Thirty one point nine due to smoking. Now you can also express this as a proportion. And a first proportion you'd like to discuss with you is that. Attributable fraction in this case. You have to attribute a bill risk. Divided by the incidence of. Exposed. The instance. In the exposed I would say. Multiplied by one hundred percent if you want to express it as a percentage. And it gives us the proportion of the disease. In those who are exposed. That can be attributed to the exposure. And this is the form last you use for incidence rates. And for instance a proportion. Now the previous one was on. Exposed. So we can say how much of the strokes. In the smoking women are or can be confirmed attributed to the smoking. But in general we are also interested especially in public health. In the population in general. And then we have something which is called the population at a beautiful risk. It tells us how much of. Extra disease. Is occurring in the population. Exposed and unexposed together. Compared to a group with an exposed. And this is our main interest often. How much of the disease. In the population. Can be potentially prevented by removing the exposure. The calculations are as follows. It's again a difference but then. The incidence rate in the population. As the main incidence rate of study. I Eric T. Total population. And we subtract the incidence rate in the unexposed So we have. Again. A Difference. For instance proportion we again. Have the instance proportion in total population. Minus incidence proportion and expose these are the easiest. Calculations But if you are all I have already calculated to at a beautiful risk which was already a difference remember from the first flight. You can simply multiplied by the prevalence of your risk factor. Smoking. In our example which gives us. The overall population attribute of all risk. So if smoking prevalence is high. The population attribute of the risk is higher than when the smoking. Prevalence is low. And of course this makes sense. Naturally. Smoking is then more important when smoking rates are higher. This is than in a graph you see a. Then the background rate. Which was in the Never smokers as in our previous example. We see it here in ex smokers current smokers and total. And you see here for the column. Total The light blue. Which is the amount. I think twelve and health. Yes. Twelve and a half for one hundred thousand. Which is the excess. Rate in the total population. Which can be attributed to. Part of the women. Not all. But part. Smoke. Again you can't calculate it also as a fraction we use that often in the literature and used. You see the population at a beautiful fraction can simply be calculated by dividing the population attribute of the risk from the previous flight. By the incidence in the total population. And multiplied by one hundred percent if you want. And this gives us the proportion of the disease in a population that can be attributed to the exposure. You see here to form a lot for instance rate an instance proportion. And we have a famous example we all know. I hope you know that for lung cancer smoking can explain thirty percent that's a famous number from reports already twenty years ago. So for based on these calculations we can say that. Twenty thirty percent of the proportion. Thirty percent of lung cancer in the total population. Can be attributed to the expulsion. Now again. Of. Almost a final slight. We look at the relative risk. Basically if we are interested in. Etiology. It measures how many times. Higher is the risk of a disease. If one group is compared to the other and. Exposed first as to an expose the attributable risk measures the actual amount of disease that can be attributed to an exposure. Such as in our example smoking. And we use that. A lot especially in public health when we need to think about. Policy decisions which factor should be tackled first we don't have enough money to tackle risk factors. And it's the same problem everywhere. So also for deciding when we want to tackle or start up a profession programme for what disease but especially what we. Risk factor. We need to have information about is attributable this. But note that this prevention. Can only work and is only. Let's say a valid. Estimate. If we're really talking about a cause effect relationship so we for really no disrespect risk causal. Because otherwise these calculations are not useful at all. So in summary I hope you have noted in this clip that we can calculate attribute of all risks. As a main issue. From our public health problems. So we had some good measures to assess the impact of our. Disease and our risk factors on the public health. You realize. I hope so that. Not always are high relative risks. Translate to high impact or. Important public health problem. And you have now the formulas to calculate.",

                "text": "The topic of this. Another clip is state diagrams of mixtures. I will focus on fairly simple mixes of water. But certain solids. Like salt and sugar. And important properties of these. Mixtures of cell phones and cell yields is the solubility of the Cellular to. Hear or see the. Dependence of the solely billeted of salt and sugar in this case salt and sugar. Depends on the temperature. For sold. The dependencies for a low. Even at higher temperatures. We can all dissolve a lot. But for sugar. We can to solve a lot more. At higher temperatures. For different compositions. We can give a state diagram. And example is the situation for pure substances like water. Where we have a pressure temperature diagram. And for every situation. We can determine the state of the face. So it can be ice. Liquids. Or our water. In the gas face. By changing the temperature. Or the pressure. We see the effect on the state of a certain face. In the case of mixed Here's the diagram. Is a bit different because now we have the composition. The SO LET'S GO indent and the temperature. And you don't see a pressure axis. Because the pressure is assumed to be constant. Also here you can see the effect of a change in temperature. Or a change in the composition and adults as the composition of a certain face. For the case of salt solution. We can distinguish furriers regions. But I do one face that. This one. The salt water. Or two faces. The other ones where we also see crystals and salt water. For the sugar solution. It's comparable. But here we see. Two regions where we have one face. It's the liquid solution. And the class estate. And we see regions with two faces. The solution. And I stress stills and part is frozen. Solution. And crystals. Of sugar. When there is a ship or saturation of the sugar. And yet the Faber. And the solution when part of the water is evaporated. At higher temperatures. You also see the IT Libyan lines. Because the boiling like the solubility lying and the liquid is line to buy new. Boiling line. Shows the boiling point. Elevation. At low so let's have a boiling point at hundred degrees. But it will increase as. We have more of the self components in the mixture. The solubility line. It tells us. The situation concentration at the higher solids content. Not everything can be dissolved. And part will be present as crystals. So at the right side of this. So the ability line. And then we have to look at this line. Where we see the effect of freezing. And here we also see a freezing point depression. Upon higher so that's content. So at low solids contents and water a solution. We have a freezing point at the zero decrease. But this will be decreased. When we have a higher level of solace in the solution. The situation for salt water. Here we had the one face. And the out of situations where we had crystals presence and in the mixture. There's a difference between this part. And this part. And both we have a solution. Salt water. But he had a crystals are of ice. Whereas here. We have sold crystals. The difference here. Starts at a level of twenty three percent salt. I'll be low to the level of. Twenty one degrees. We have no solution anymore but only. Crystals of ice crystals of salt. A few We start with salt water. With a salt content of fifteen percent. By cooling this. We crossed a freezing line. Ice crystals are formed. And the salt water. That is remade. Has a higher salt content. So it's sort of divided. In ice crystals and. A concentrated Salcha Lucian. With this salt content. It's a bit different. When we go to our higher selves level. So we start here. We are above to. Eutectic point. We now decrease the temperature. It's not that ice crystals will be formed but salt crystals will be formed. So part of the salt is no president solve crystals. And the remaining. Solution. Has a lower shelled content. You might want to know how much sole do we have in crystals. And how much. Solution do we have or in the other case. How much ice crystals do we have and how much salt solution do we have. This can be determined with a tiling starting with salt water and crossing the freezing line. We can draw a line where we go to the situation of ice crystals. With no salt in it at all and to the right. The situation where we have to concentrate that salt solutions. We have to fractions. Together they are one and. Making a mouse balance. We can determine the amount of ice. And the amount of salt water. Can be derived using the smallest balance. And the same can be applied for the situation where a part of the water is evaporated. So in the boiling. Situation. Aykroyd. Crossing the boiling line. Similar for a sugar solution. Assume. We start at the level of three percent sugar. Again we make the tie line. Where we have crystals. Of ice form. No sugar in them. And a concentrated sugar solution. So it's comparable. For the steak for the situation of. Of sugar. We also see a classy. Face in the Star state diagram. It's here. At low temperatures. And it's furry high sugar concentrations. Assume we start with a solution. Again a solution of sugar. And we increase the temperature of the concentration very fast. Can be. During drying. We come in across the region. The same is true for the situation where we start. Already in a concentrated. Composition and we decreased attempt your really fast. While we start with a face of order is no order an amorphous state of the. Of the liquids. In case we. Immobilize it. For the fast. We will get a classy. Solet so the water. This immobilized. But it will be comparable to the liquid. Regarding its degree of order. Actually there is no order. In case there would be more time. So slow. Cooling or a slower concentration. The water. Or just focus would like to go to their. Preferred States. That's the crystalline. State. But it depends on the on the speed of this transition. But are you will get across the state or a crystalline state and case. You start in a classy state your you have a product in the glossy state. And then increase. The water content a little bit. Then again. Sugar crystals will be formed. So summarizing the situation for she grows a show me start with a solution. In case we boil it begets a vapor. What a favor and a concentrated sugar sugar Lucian. Case with the freezer to get ice crystals and a concentrated sugar solution. Case we concentrate. We get a Supercenter ration. So we get crystals and. Again the solution is there. And case we have a very high sugar content we can bring it in the glossy state. It's a bit more complicated. For the case of starch do that nice a ship. Starch. They differ starch granules are in a semi crystalline state. So we start. For instance this region. Upon heat day. There will be a transformation. Into a poem or solution. And it's done in the rubbery state. Reside ration. And it's almost melting off of the starch. Similar thing is leader as a face tradition from the crystalline state. Which was there. In the native starch. To watch the rubbery state. So it was a transition from the order to what should this order state. About heating. To also be evaporation of water and. In this case we go to the left. Because here we have to watch a fraction on the. X. axis. So we go to the left when. Water is evaporated. Going On and on we can end up at the very low water content. This is the case for her France's bread baking. The outer layer. The crust. Will come into crispy state and. In fact that this is the classy stage for for in the case of breath. So stay diagrams. Tell us the state of a certain face. You can see the equilibrium conditions. And Ricky. Can see the face transitions upon increasing. Temperature pressure or. That the soul it's content. The state diagrams are given as a as a pressure temperature diagram. Mainly for pure substances or. As a temperature. Composition diagram. In the case of mischief. And there. The pressure is assumed to be constant.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I will explain you about the basics of drying kinetics. Between drying. Rick and primarily distinguish the two different periods of constant rate drying period. And the falling rate. Brian periods. In this movie. You can see a drying drop at it's a single drop of drying. And it could be seen Representative FORD. Drawing of a drop of drink spray drying. You saw a steady decrease. Of the drop at size and. After that you see at a certain time. The surface starts to look and. Particle starts to Frink. And here very peculiar morphology. This is frivolous morphology and. If you look carefully you can also see that the hole is being formed and. Tiny aggression. In a particle is created. Now so the idea is the first period we have steady state if emperor a sion. And a second period. After the looking point. Is controlled by diffusion is diffusion limited drying. Because the particle hardly shrinks anymore. Which still there's drying occurring. And it's because moisture defuses from inwards to outwards. And if that evaporates. Now on the right and sent side. You see over it way protein droplets. If you look carefully then you can actually see that it's a right hand side of a CULE is being formed. Which evolves in a very large fake you also in the end you get a very thin shell. As Also here you see first. Ideas Frink itch. Which can be presented. Or you can also call it. The root of concentrated period. And then a second period. Is actually much better represented by this last. Left droplet its shape is more or less the same. But drying occurs because of diffusion. Of water from. In to out by ferry nice to see here the differences between the two materials and a different morphology actually to the physical properties of the materials. It's very much. Determining the final foliage of the particle. And that's actually. Ongoing Risher. Research. How these properties. Are related to final morphology development during drying. In this light. You can see actually two periods in a fish or allies in this graph. And so here on the Y. axis. We have to moisture content. Poultice for just a drying time. What we see actually. Is that in the first. Small period of time. The product heats up. Then we have a constant drying period. Which is reflected by the constant drying rate. Which you can actually do right from the slope of these curve and it is straight line. So the value of two running rate is constant. At the end of the drying time the drying rate will decline SOL So the slope will decline. To draw the triangle proceeds more slowly. The constant doing to concentrate period. The particle is still very wet. And if the peroration. Is. Of moisture. Is slimming limiting. Extern externally. So the product or the droplets. Is at the wet. Built. Temperature. The damn picture. Is this relatively low. To the dry build temperature. During the second. Drying period. The falling rate variance the poly particle is getting dry at the outside. That's all we have to looking point. And also death diffusion in a product. Is limiting. And as a result of the reduced evaporation. The product will increase in temperature. So the product will not be any more at the wet the temperature. We can also plots. The. Her for a little bit different so if you plot. The drying rate. On the Y. axis and time. On the X. axis. We can see that the drying rate will increase until. Also Fell you. And that is valid for the entire concentrate periods. Now and then during the falling rate period. The drying rates will decline. Often people. Promotes so-called drying rate curve. Which uses. On the Y. axis to driving rates. And on the X. axis. The amount of moisture in the products. Not then we have to read. These plots from the right. To the left. We see that the drying rate increases. As the moisture. Decreases somewhat. But this is actually the heating up. Period. Now then we have to concentrate periods. Until the critical moisture content. And then. At this point. The looking already critical moisture content. Drying rate starts to decline. With the final. With the falling rates variance sequentially. We have here an equilibrium. Moisture content. Which would be the final. Most accountant of the product. And equilibrium. With the air. We cannot go beyond this value. S.. Then we would have an opposite. Driving Force went into products. So destroying rate curve is very much. Used in practice and also used in literature. And in fact implicitly you can find a quiet time. For drying in both spirits. By using and walk wanted thief. And that assists. Of course in real life the drying rate groups do not look that nicely. And it is related because of the complex structure of food products. For example here is the. Drying rate careful for minced meat. Product reflects on the Y. axis again the right drawing rate on the X. axis. The drying time. What we see. Is that the plateau is not that needs for an ideal. Product. Perhaps. Like sand. Which is also a porous. Product. But is has a more. Constant drying rate period. So you see also that the properties of the product. Are of large influence to the drawing rate curve. Then I will show you some plots. On the drying of tomato slices and. On the left graph which show the moisture content. As a function of the drying time for different. Drying air temperatures. Which immediately see is that with higher. Air drying temperatures. We have a more efficient. Drying so to. Water remove all. Occurs at a faster rate. This is because of the lower relative humidity in the air at the higher temperature. But also because during the falling rate. There is duty fifty. At the higher temperature is larger. So. Also the fall rate period. The seats larger. At high temperatures. The drawback. Of using larger temperatures. Is that to put a quality. Can be affected. And I for example here. You see. Shrinkage. And especially for example reactions like my Yar or Browning reactors can occur. If the product temperature increases too much. At this site. We can actually see the official drying. Rate curve where the drying rate is supposed to as a function of the moisture content. And here you should look. From the right to the left. And you see that the drawing rate. Of the highest temperature. Is the highest overall. On the next light. You see the drying. Rate curse. Off. Most room. Products. And. Great products. Now what you can actually see here. Is that for these type of products. Constant rate period. Is relatively short compared to the falling rates periods. And so death dates of most of the time. And that is because of the diffusion. Process which is relatively slow. And especially. Somewhat larger products. Here you can see that actually the most room. Is larger than the grapes. If the products are larger than the length for diffusion. Is also relatively larger So then the following period to be that will be relatively longer. So that's important to remember. Finally I will summarize here. What we have learned during this knowledge is good and so first we have trains and heating period. That's period one. During which the product heats up. To do better. Built. Temperature. The moisture content which is affected by the blue girth drops during the course and vapor it's using a constant. Drying rate or having a constant drying rate. When a critical moisture content is reached a disappoint. We will enter the following rates periods. And unifying great periods drying rate. Will decline. And so the slope of the moisture content. Will also decline in this port. At the same time. The temperature of the product will start to increase and eventually to get down picture of the drying air. OK this similar rises does not it's clip where you learnt about drying kinetics in a quality sense. I we distinguish. Two different drying. Periods. On the one hand. The concentrated drying period. And the other hand the falling rate. Trying period.",

                "text": "And this knowledge clip. I will explain you about different types of equipment for convective. Air drying on this light. You can see. Three different types of convective drying equipments first one our trade dryers second phone. I spray dries and the third one off who does better writers. Well. Tray dryers are more used for so let's food products like fetch the bowls and fruits. Spray dries are typically used to dry liquids or liquid concentrates. Finally food as bed dryers. Are something intermediate or are used in combination of the spray drying. To an off the drying. Or. I used to dry for example. Rice or all the types of. More solid type products. First tray dryers for eight hours are actually perfectly suited for larger products. They have no. Extended drying times which is partly related of course to the size of the product. The products are spread out across a trace. And the strays are generally. Both porous material. Such that the. Products get me well exposed to the drying air. Here are the right hand side you can see schematically. Such a tray dry system. Which is a better one here. We have intake of fresh air. The air is first heated through a final hold air. Fire. Heater coals. Then a fan. Subsequently flow distribution is made. Homogeneously. By installing these specific vents and these screens. Now and then. The product which is located here on the strace. Is exposed to to hold. Air. Now you can imagine that. While drying. The products will decrease in much the content. Now what type of products. We can dry. Here. There is a lot of examples. Ranging from. It's a very traditional products like fetch the bowls and fruits. Like raisins prunes fics etc. To sweeten products. Like them berries blueberries. Mango. Sometimes even candy like candy like. Fruits. But by a T.V. or pineapple. But also more. Also all the products are being dried. Dried bought from fruits. Like pasta or Instant Soup ingredients. Or pastries. Apart from. Betts trade RICE We also have continuous trade writers. The nice thing of continuous trade Rice is that you can operate at a much higher capacity. Because you can continuously feet. New trucks with race. I would actually see is a guard or a truck. Has been fully stocked with rates. And these are positioned in. And channel. Here at the left there so fresh air inlet air is being heated. Using corals and the whole air is exposed to incoming wet. Trucks wait that product and the trucks move. In the same direction as the airflow deaths. Not. Finally at the end of the air channel. The product is dry. And it more often gas bill escapes. Fight a top. And here. There is an exit for the drive trucks. And this way we can also make more efficient use of the air compared to Bet's systems. As we can situate. The air. Further in washer. However there is also another modes. Not only we can operate in a coker mild. But we can also operate in a consequent lot. In this case the French will be trying. Boarded in the opposite direction. Of the airflow. So here we have to count the current of on the air flow is from the right. Deal to the left. And the tracks. Are moved in the opposite direction. Not the advantage. For doing so is that a driving force if that peroration. Will be much higher. Because the dry product. Is exposed also to do air with the lowest relative humidity. Having the highest. Difference. At the highest driving force for evaporation. The only drawback is that. If you expose hold air. To a relatively dry product. Then also the temperature of this product will rise immediately. And this can be detrimental for the product quality. While the CO current and Co current situation. Exposed The Holts air. To a relatively wet. Product. So you operate in the beginning. I think helped vet bill temperature which will be much lower than the dry Bill temperature. Has so. Infected. Coke or and mass it is especially preferred. If your product is quite sensitive towards high temperatures. Now that concludes my to part about trade right now we continue with spray drying. Spray drying. It's a very effective method. To drive liquid products. It is based on a very high atomization. Off the product into small minute. Droplets. Here you can see an example of a very very diluted spray. Of such small droplets which have a. Diameter of about hundred micron an even smaller. At the same time. At the top. Drying air is injected. Because the droplets. Are dispersed in very small droplets we create an enormous surface area. Which enhances the evaporation rate. In fact. The residence time of the office in situ dry. It's really really short in a few seconds. They are being. To a large extent right. Because the Federation goes so quickly and the Federal Police are exposed to the dry air. We operate mostly at the wet built temperature. Especially at the start of the drying. This makes this process father modeled. Because the droplets. Experience the Web built temperature rather than the dry air. Actually for non-food IP cases you sometimes also see that the drying air. Is injected from the bottom of the spray dryer. And then you operate in a come to current mode. Which is from energy point a few attractive. But from product quality. Point a few. That's attractive. Because of the same reason as a cold current. Drying During for a drying is prefer it. Now what type of products. Are being produced using spray dryers. Many spray Doris are actually present in a dairy industry. I saw there are also a range of dairy products like. Infant formula. Baby food. Total in addition. Way protein isolates screams like those is. And on the right incentives and cites you see some examples. Also many plants. Proteins are in basic ingredients. Isolates and concentrates are being sprayed right. In these processes. People use a lot of water to extract. Proteins for example on and off the debt that you do spray drying process to formulate the powder. Also all the applications concern. Coffee and food uses. And also a very nice one is the spray drying of yeast. Actually to spray drying of living organisms look such as probiotics and yeast is a special one. It should be done very mild in order that these microorganisms do not lose their viability during spray drying. And because we operate for to a large extent at overbuilt temperature. It is a very mild. That's to be sure of these and therefore. For further. If you want to make further use of the yeast for example to make a nice beer. Finally there are also many non-food applications. We mention few here. For example the production of detergents for some pharmaceutical components and greens for commit cosmetic applications. They also Qur'an mix and. Chemicals. Are also quite well known applications for spray drying processes. Here you can actually see a large scale a unit spray dry a system. It's pretty huge such a Tambor. And you should imagine that. Actually the space that is all cooked by Body Spray dyes not very effectively used. And we have a very dilute mist of droplets and. Particles inside should to spray drier. Which is actually a pity. Because then it's not very energy efficient. What's also often done. Is off the spray drying. Your product is still rather moist. And therefore often an after drying step is light. It's not very well feasible. But this is a food ice better drier. Which is used to extend the drying time. To remove the lots last piece. Bits of moisture. And also do some cooling. I because especially if for example the core of particles is still relatively wet. And you would store does. The spider. Back then these more moisture would migrate to the surface of the particles and you would get cake formation so. You bought a little lump. In and yet so therefore. After drying and cooling to room temperature is important for the functionality or for the for the for good. Powder properties. Also very important aspect. In making spray dry powder. Is the morphology of the POTUS because these morphologies. To large extent. Influenced the product properties. For example. A property like the. Density of a powder. If you have a very low build density that means that you have high transportation costs. If you have for example failure if area. If you have very high. Build density then it may be that. For example. Your phone bill T. is very low. Here you can see different types of morphologies in the case when you have no or nearly no shrinkage. A few particle. You will have a porous particle. For example here in this spray dried milk powder we see porous that are being formed. More often we see that particles to some extent shrink. So this would be an ideal case where you have perfect trinkets. Because of the moisture of operation. But more often. We'll see that some of that the should morphology is being created. For example including a void in the particle or. SURFACE. Which first forms an elastic sted skin. Starts to wrinkle. Or shrivel. And crack formation or curse. Also very often we see combination of the previously mentioned. Phenomena. By here below you can see. So much follow G.'s we presented in scanning electron microscope images. Was also often done to improve the flow billet your to proud or properties. Is that some. Agglomeration some degree of. A glimmer ration is applied and this is done by for example partly returning smaller particles from the food as bet. So. So-called finds for eternal. And that is entered again into the spray dryer. Despotic calls a globe or a thing new droplets. They partly Mirch if you want you can see here. To the new particles. And they form. Somewhat larger a glimmer writes. Having a glimmer it's very practical. As it improved the flow ability. And also can enhance For example dissolution behavior. The third method I will discuss here is food I spent. As I said it is often combined for spray drying processes and it involves the following. Approach. Now here you see. Let's kill spray. Dryer. You know where. Holt. Air is injected from the bottom through a porous plate and. Voter is put on top of that. Plate and it's actually fluid eyesores moving. Because of the supply told. Air flow. Effect. And this type of equipment. Allows for a longer residence time. Which is very relevant to remove the last bits of moisture. And that is related to the falling rate. Period of drying. Which is usually much more extended than the concentrated drying periods. Also food as bed drying is often combined with. Agglomeration of smaller into larger particles which in. And hence is the potter property such as. You know every constitution behavior. Finally also a cooling step is often applied here you see a schematic. Picture of a continuous operating food I bet we had a product is fed on one side and and. The dry product is obtained. Perhaps also granulated on the right side. Not on the granulation I can ration is often done by injecting some binding liquids. Could be for example just water bottles. To bind them together. I want type of products. Are Being food out of bed right. For example sprayed out products. Which have an off the dry treatment or and a cooling step. But also just plain. Stand alone used drying. Ground in the products like. ERPs grains fries. Shrimps. And sliced festivals. That's first continuous sis food us bed drying. And so here we see a typical. Equipment for drying hundred fifty dollars per bets. Alternatively again. Spray binding leave it on top of the food as bets and. Carry out a dry step. And in the end and. One will carry out. According step. By supply. Cool air. To the beds and so the product changes in time. In his equipment from being a raw material to a granulated cooldown product. Alternatively we can also use continuous. Equipment. That a product is fed from the left to the right. And then we have for example different zones. For example here and a glimmer ations zone which with binding liquid being sprayed. And drying steps. Being drawing air being applied. A final drying step to get the powder really dry and really final. Cooling step to have the product being cool downed to ambient conditions. I did vantage of the continuous. Food has been dryer is that it can operate at the high capacity. But the disadvantage is that the capital costs involved will be higher. Finally a little bit about the mechanism of making these agglomerate. So we have this. Spraying of the binder on the primary particles. These liquids. These forms of liquid bridges between the particles. And because of the drying. There transforms into. Solet riches. To finally obtain the eye glow merits. I reach as a berry type like structure. I different types of. Morphologies can be created. You can actually create a voter that has a relatively low density. And which can be a contagious for Sam for flow ability and. Also reconstitution behavior. Sometimes it's also very practical to first do in a collaboration step before for example tablet ing. And he's a glimmer a TZ. You have a more attractive of more effective properties to do. Applications. This sim arises. Mike a knowledge clip. All different and go back to air drying methods. Starting with the trade Ryan method continue with the spray drying method and finalizing with this fluid ice better. Drying method.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I will explain you. About the basics of how to design a dry system. And also share with you. How you can evaluate efficiency of a drying system. First. We will set up the MAS balances. Across a dryer. And when I talk about a modern balance. Then I talk about the water miles better. For setting up. The Mars balance we actually use different flow rates than for example for you Federation process here. We define the Maslow rate on the basis of the dry air. And a dry salt streams which is different for example from if aberration process is very defined in MA flow rates. On total total. Stream and mass. Also the product. Content or the moisture content of the air in a product are defined in a slightly different way. The moisture content of the air. Is expressed in Quito water per kilo dry air. The moisture content of the product. Is expressed in Kilo water per kilo dry so it's not actually. We do so define their concentrations or the composition. Because it makes life more easy because the so let's just remain in the product. And the dry air. Just remains in the air. It's only the water. That is being transferred between the two phases. Now then to summarise the moss balance. On the left hand side we have all the water that comes into the dryer system. And so on this. We have the incoming mortar. From the air. So the moisture content multiplies with the amount of air that is fed to the dryer. Dryer then. We have the incoming moist air fired a product. So the. Dry So lets the product that is being set. Per second. Multiplied with the. More separate dry so let's. And there should be equal to the total sum of the moisture content. The moisture present. And I'll go on air. And I'm always there in the product. And of course. What you will see is that and more so will be transferred from the product. To the air. Next to the models balance we also have that insists. We can also use D.C. to implement design of the drive system. Here you can see an example or. The definition of the energy or entropy balance. This energy balance. Is actually set up using the entropy contents of both air. And the product. Three percent and by the H. symbols. Also D.S. and P. values have been expressed in a different way than we have done before for example for using if oppression process is also dry air bases or dry soul as basis. If we simmer rise. The energy balance. Then we have the entropy. That comes in fire ID air the entropy that comes invite a product. And of course on the right and send it should equal to the outgoing and to P. off the air. And I'll go in and appeal. The products. So that is basically the energy balance. Then we have to calculate if there was the entropy contents. And that. Those have been defined as follows. First forty air. The air is composed of two different species. On the one hand. We have the air molecules. That is represented by this part. The specific heat. Of the air multiplied. With the temperature. Mine is the reference temperature. Plus the. Faber part of a four part consists of. If I praise an entity that Ciro degree Celsius. And. To heat up the paper. Till the actual temperature of the. Of the air favor make sure we use this specific heat of the vapor. Multiplied with the temperature of the air of Eva make sure minus the reference temperature. And of course we need to take into account the composition of the amount of favor that is present in this mixture. Now and then we obtain the final entropy content of their favorite mixture. After the product it's more simple. Because the product is represented by the specific heat of the soul that's close to specific heat off. The world are also here we use a reference temperature and. We use. The W. to repeat the composition. So the amount of water in this case. Of the products that Sim rises. Both the mass and energy balance is then I will explain you a little bit more about how to calculate the dryer efficiency. Either dry efficiency. Is actually defined by the amount of energy that you require to evaporate one kilo of water. And to remove funkier of water by drying. And you actually can make very handy use all the. Psychometric charts to evaluate the efficiency of a drying step. So here you see. We present ation our visualisation. Of the drying process. So he to air. From this condition. To the inlet air conditions. Which is hot air. Idea better to be separated. To number three. So that is let's say the outgoing air which is supposed to be an equilibrium here. With the product. We can now read out. What is the entropy. Or the energy that you add to this process. And that is reflected by the difference of entropy. At this point. Minus. This point. So you can actually read out the entropy values. By following the diagonal. And then that and the P. values will be brief centered there. Now you have to. The fight this. Amount of energy that you supply by the amount of water that has been evaporated. That you do. You can read out it's from this point so the humidity content. The death point. Minus humidity call that. The death points. If you divide those two your day in the dryer. Efficiency in Killer fuel per kilo. It's important to realize that the ever present entropy of water. At zero degrees Celsius. Is actually two thousand five hundred cubic Elving per killers you're pretty low. You will find that your dry efficiency is most probably much lower than this ever present entropy. Actually if you look at the drying process is the use we have only drawing efficiency. Of approximately fifty percent which means that they use. Twice if it breaks and to be. This is actually. Inherent to this process. And it's also one of the reasons why people combine. First and if I break the step and then. A drying step because if. It's much more efficient than drying. And then. The drying step is taking place within as much concentrated solution as possible. Of course during drying. Much more happens and only the removal of water. Also Dr product its shapes. Powder is being made now I would like to give you an example of an air dryer design. I suppose we are a manufacturer of mushroom sauce and we want to produce this. VOTER FROM from a mushroom sauce. First we concentrate. The source mass by of oppression and then we dry it in a spray dryer. We have information about heat capacity of the water. And Environmental of the source. And here you can see that the. Specific heat of the dry matter is much lower than the. Specific heat of the water. We also know that to concentrate leaves the evaporator at a certain. Flow rate of zero point fifty three killer seconds. And we know that a product fraction. Is open twenty eighth of a dry matter Paquito total. I just from this. Number three can already see that these are not the right. Units. For doing. A dryer design. Because for a dryer design. We need to have products three mm in Quito. So let's for second. And also. Product composition. We need to know. And keep dry matter. Or kilo water per kilo. Dry matter. Now here below you can actually see a representation of a schematic representation of the process the drying process. We see here first. Heating up. Of the air. From fifty six degrees having a relative humidity of zero point six. To a final temperature of ninety degrees. And subsequently distemper if any of the key separated but. In contact with the product. To a final. Temperature of again. Fifty six degrees. Now we can reproduce and of visualize this process in the psychometric chart and. With this. We can actually calculate the exit concentration of the product using the. Psychometric chart. So this is a psycho medical chart and for that you cannot leave read everything very well. But I will guide you through. First we heat up the air from. Air conditioned to. One thousand degrees from fifty six to ninety degrees. Then we are going to add you bet the secure rate from ninety to fifty six degrees. And then we in fact can read out the humidity. That's two points. This point and that point and. We find. It's not very well. Visible so I just pulled them here below. For Holt air that is supplied. To dryer. It has water on that. Sixty five grand water per kilo dry air and. Do you need to fight for the outgoing air. As a water content. Mostly content of eighty two gram water. To kill dry air. Not. Simmer rising. We do the calculations. So first we recalculate the flow rate. And the product in position. Into the right units. So first a flow rate from queued up a second. Into Quito dry met up a second. Then we obtain a flow rate of. Open fifty kilo dramatic a second. We also we calculate the products composition. In to keep the water per kilo dry matter. Then we ought to take water composition of two point fifty seven people water. The kilo dry matter. Not having these fellows in mind. Plus the values that we read from the psychometric chart. And knowing that. The feet of air is fifty five feet up a dry air. Second. We know these two we just calculated those. We have the water balance. As I just explained. Then. If those of the military. And then we can calculate finally. Because if we fill in the balance we only have one unknown. Which is the most the content of the outgoing product. Which is equal to two kilo was our particular dry matter. And so this for a fight is the answer to our. Exercise. Now you should realize that this scale collation. Using psychometric chart is only allowed. If we assume no loss to heat to the environment. More over the product should enter at the Red Bull. Conditions. And also through to be fairly wet. At the end of the process. And so there was like to fifty should the fairly be higher than zero point nine. Because if the product. Too much. Then it will heat up and. With the kennel followed at about except for a shit anymore. OK simmer rising this knowledge kip. Has learned you about how to design a dryer. Using Moss and he balances. Doing so in combination with a psychometric chart. You can for example calculate what would be the exit product. Wants to call it and having certain conditions. For example the drying air conditions etc.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip will explain you how to use of psycho medic chart. Here you see. Psychometric charts. You can use it to connect and relate different physical and thermodynamic properties of air Faber mixtures. For example disappoint you see. You can directly. Find the Dr Bill of temperature. You can find the specific humidity. And you can also find the corresponding relative humidity value. The Web built temperature. And did you point to temperature. Moreover. You can find the entropy values. Following this line. Please keep in mind that each. Psychometric chart. Is only valid for a constant pressure for example atmospheric pressure. At sea level. Now what can you now do with a psychopathic chart. For example. If you heat. There. Repeat chanted by this dolt. A to another temperature and not a dry build temperature to be. Then you can actually determine the properties of. Air at point B.. For example what you can quickly see is their relative humidity. Of. Air be decreased. To a large extent. This is very much desired. If you want to for example. He signed a dryer system. You want to have a low relative humidity. So that you can absorb a lot of moisture from the air. Not that is being done by heating up. The air. Bit more complicated one. Is that you can actually assess the composition. When mixing two different era Fabre mixtures. For example. Make sure it's a and B.. And we mix them. At the about the CLI as to there's no heat loss to the environment. Now. It is represented here. Air. A Airstream has this composition. There seem to be as death composition. And we mix them together. So then we end up with. Apparently composition see the exact point of C.. Depends on the ratio of the Macias of the two streams. Actually the mostest the most ratios are reflected by the lengths. Off the partial. Lengths of the lines and. In this way. You can actually calculate what would be the composition if you mix. In this case is fifty fifty mixture of A and B.. If it would be not. Fifty fifty. Then. C. would shift. Along this line. Depending on the ratio. Now another one another application. Is drying without addition of a movable feet so idea Benteke. Situation. Then you would start for example with. Composition. Which is hold. Air at a very thrifty low. But if you get it he also you low humidity. And we would set your rated idea better CLI. Until point B.. So we marched in the air and aerobatic. Way. By evaporating moisture from the products. There's no heat loss to the surroundings. And what we actually assume here. Is that this line. Is aligned. Or has the same angle. As the entropy line that is on topic line. Actually this is not completely the case. Because the idea better to ration line which would truly represent this line. Is a little bit. Shifted. Or as a little bit different angle. Then that is on topic line. But for now. That is OK. Now I'm going to represent oarfish allies. Milty States. Drying process in the. Psychometric chart. We start up with heating. Of air. For example. Having. Amiens conditions. To a very high. Right built temperature. You can see that humidity. Effect remains the same. While the relative humidity. Will decrease very much. Then. Are you going to add your Benteke least set your rate of the air by contacting you to the product. We end up with this point. Now then we can actually apply another drying step in a separate dryer. But we need to first heats the air again to a higher temperature. And the lower. Relative humidity. Now that we can do a second drying step. So to be full again the idea Benteke situation line. And even. We can follow. A third step. So then we make it off. And we achieve this final. Air composition. However we cannot do this just infinitely. Because the humidity of the air. Decrease increases and therefore the efficiency of the overall process. Will also decrease. And so at a certain point it's not. Not economically feasible anymore. To to do of. The next stage of drying. Piece note again that. In this design or in these facilities ation resume again. That all energy is used for evaporation and there is no heat loss to the environment. Not now a real. Psychometric chart. This one is actually valid for very high temperatures. Actually not very strange temperatures as drying. Inlet air conditioned during temperature inlet their conditions are usually very high. For example we here have a halt. Air. With a dry Bill temperature of two hundred thirty degrees. It has a relative humidity. Of. Zero point zero five percent. Then. We can follow the idea Benteke situation one order. Is on topic line. And we see that the corresponding with Bill temperature is very low it's only fifty degrees. Actually the product experience is distemper ature So it's not dead that's because if you have. For example if you would have a temperature of two hundred thirty degrees. The product would be quite. Dermody damaged. So that's not very much desired. But while drying. Actually the product experience is distemper ature So there will be perfectly OK. Also please note that the humidity. Content is low. But not that low. Because if you realize that. At this stage. When we just. Let's say. Have the engine air. The same. Humidity. But then a different temperature. Then the relative humidity of the air is about eighty percent. And that's actually quite high. And so by heating up. We can gain a lot of capacity to be able to drive and still. The product is that in reasonable temperature. So this is. This is actually nicely demonstration of how to use. Psychometric chart. To design and type of systems. So repping up. I showing you how to use. Psychometric talk for different types of applications how to heat up. Air. How to mix. Air. And also how do I do you bet likely such a rate air. Finally I showed you a case for driving. And showed you that. It really helps. Heating up the air from lower to higher temperature. You have a low relative humidity so you have a high source in capacity. And you operate in fact that they were built temperature so it is not that strange to use these high temperatures.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip. Is going to explain you did. From the mental side commit three psycho miter. Is that to mean a nation. Of physical and two men the name of properties of cost favor makes yours. The term. Psychiatry. Is derived from the Greek. Meaning cold. And that from. Meaning means. Of measurement. First I'm going to give you some definitions of physical and tumor the namin properties of. Air a favor makes yours. The application. Or the definitive of these properties. Are very relevant. In relation to driving. And so hold air. Is conducted with wet food. And absorbs Faber. And so it takes of moisture. And so definitive of moisture content. Is irrelevant. The first definitive of moisture content. Is the absolute humidity. Which is the most a fraction of moisture in the air. And that this was presented by the symbol. X.. It is proportional to the amount of water molecules. If I go by the total number of molecules in the air and fire the ideal gas law. You can also. Conferred these most this small a fraction. To favor pressure. The partial pressure of water in the air defied by the total pressure. Which is the sum of the water. And the air pressure. A more used. Morse the contents. In the design of dryer systems. Is the humidity ratio. Or just plain the most of the contents of the unit of that humidity ratio is the model of water over dry air. Defining the unity. Like this in air. Makes life a little bit more easy when designing. Dryer systems. It is represented by a symbol. W.. Capital W.. And it is the miles of water. If I did buy the. Mossel fair. Again. This can also be connected to do. Partial pressure of water. And that box of pressure. Of air. Finally we can obtain this formula which expresses the humidity ratio. As a function of the Boche a pressure of water and. The total pressure. Of the air. Finally there is another way of representing them. Moisture in the air. And that is the relative humidity. The relative humidity. Is valid only at a specific temperature. If we presented the relative amount of faith in air. At a specific temperature. Related to the maximum amount of. Faber that can be present in the air. At that then preacher. It is this situation. At the next moment. Said to ration. Pressure. Here. You can see the formula for the relative humidity which is the actual pressure of water. If I did but he said to ration pressure. The situation pressure you can actually obtain from the steam table or. Calculated using a question on the next light. I will explain you about some temperatures that are also used to correct the rise. Air. Fabre meters. Not first the simplest one. Which is to dry Billick temperature. It is basically the normal air temperature. That you measure with a thermal meter. Then a somewhat more complicated one. And that is the wet built temperature. The Weatherill temperature. You can measure. With a thermal meter. But then. Wraps with a completely wet it's a clot. Around it's subsequently. You can determine to read. Bill temperature. If we apply a constant. Airflow. To the temperature. With the rest lot of around it. Because of the evaporation. The temperature will drop to the wet built temperature. You can only measure the wet built temperature. When the cloth. Is still. Lately what's actually in real day life. You also sometimes. Experience that you have evaporative cooling that you have had for example if you sweat. Then you have to inspirations. Appear on your skin. And it's more so if that parades and thereby. You will attract. Heat from the environment. And you will cool down your body. Similar thing is done. During drying. Where of course the product cannot generate heat. Compared to your body. But the product attracts the heat from the environment. And cools down to the wet built temperature. The wet built temperature. Is very relevant. To drying here. We presented. More schematically. And so on the one hand. We have heat transfer from the environment. To the droplets. And he transfers proportional to heat transfer of Go Fish and. Multiplied by the temperature difference. The temperature of the burn look. Which is T. minus the wet built temperature. Now this heat transfer is balanced by mostly evaporation. Which is represented here. So the amount of more certain Federated is equal to a monstrous for a call fish and. Multiplied with the concentration. Difference between. The surface. This concentration of water vapor need to surface. And in the book. In principle. The read Bill temperature is not dependent on air flow rate because the transfer of coffee and a must pass for a core fish and. Are are linked together. So if you. For example increase the air flow rate. You will increase. The heat transfer of course and that automatically also the mass transfer of course into the increase. So you will remain at the same weight Bill temperature. Also realize that the read Bill temperature is usually lower than the dry Bill temperature. Because of the cooling. It's only when you have air. With a relative humidity of hundred percent so that is fully. Such a rated Fabre. Then the wet Bill temperature is equal to the dry Bill temperature. Finally. As I said actually sat by Bill temperature is dependent on the relative humidity so if you have a low relative humidity. Also to read Bill temperature. Will be lower. On the next. On the next topic. Is called a coma zation. Is that you point temperature. Dewpoint temperature. Indicates a temperature at which a moist air once a favor starts to condense. When cooling the air. Actually if you have glasses you sometimes experience this. For example when you enter a greenhouse. Which has a very hot and humid environment. There water vapor will condense on your glass. I debt. Re presents. Zation and. You have there to do point temperature. Then the final element that I would like to discuss here and which is very relevant for driving is a better situation. Actually you can consider drying to be an empty bed except to ration. Process when you operate at about the temperature. So in effect. Heat is transferred to the products. I want or evaporates. And no heat. Is lost to the environment. So in principle you can talk about. Idea Benteke situation. Of the air. Because of the moisture If I pray. Now here you see that also schematically was presented. So I suppose you have drawing air. At a certain temperature. But as soon amount of faith or relative humidity. You feed that. To an insulated chamber. And you have water. Evaporated. At the Red Bull temperature. Then the air will be completely saturated and. Temperature will just settle at the Red Bull temper. And if a for the amount of paper. Will go to such a ration. And here you can see also the equation. That describes the idea Benteke situation line. Going from your original heir to the final bill temperature. I saw the original temperature it would be wrong. Corresponding to the moisture content of one. And a final temperature. The Red Bull temperature will then be Condition two which is a temperature. And a specific watch the contents. Then. Because recalculations old brought properties into one into one another is very complex. Very often people used. Psychometric charts. Which we presented to abandon Amec properties of moist. As a constant pressure. You should realize that these. Psychometric darts are. For certain pressure. Most of the time at atmospheric pressure. But if you have for example have a dryer system which operates on a mountain. That you would then you'll need to use a different psychometric chart. On the X. axis. We see. The dry Billups temperature. Which we've sent out here on the Y. axis. We have to specific humidity. In Quito water per kilo dry air. And then we can go to a certain point for example disappoint. The Blue Point. And there we can actually do for displace ific air. Favor composition we can determine to Dr Beller bill of temperature by just following the green arrow. We can follow. The red arrow. Then we obtain a specific humidity. But we can also find all the properties for example the relative humidity. Then we need to look at the value of these curves. Or we can find a way Bill temperature then we have to go to this point where we have hundred percent relative humidity. There we can find a wet. Temperature. At that point we can also find the dew point. We just followed the yellow arrow. We cool down the air. Until we have a hundred percent humidity. And this condensation. Now. There are also all or it's like the entropy. Content You can also do right from the committed charts and that's also very interesting. Especially if you want to calculate. Drier fish and she's like a magic chart. In real life. So it fell at this one. Atmosphere of pressure which can also see here. Is that there are even more properties that are sometimes used to specific fully move air. Cue particular dry air. And was also very important is to realize that the validity of these type of charts. Is often for a limited range of temperatures so this one from minus ten degrees Celsius to fifty five degrees Celsius. However if we for example design dry seasons then often distemper too will become hollow higher. So therefore we have also although once. This one will go up to a temperature of one to twenty degrees. And even their. Higher wants. But I would not told them. Also people use notes. Psychometric charts of the diagrams. And he's more you diagrams are in fact. Similar to cycle method charts the only thing is that the properties have been dealt with in different way. Actually the axis of the diagram psychometric chart have been rotated and flipped. To obtain one another and. Why do I show them all your diagram. There is because it is preferred by many drunk professionals I hear you see an example of the more you diagram on the Y. axis. We have to Dr Bill of temperature. And on the X. axis. We now have the specific. Humidity gram. Water. Q. load right here where you can also see here. Is that we not only have an LP clients. We also have. Idea Benteke said to ration lines. Actually they are more or less similar. So if there is no. Intel pick or if there is no idea about the situation line. Then for a drying process you also might follow. The Intel pick line. But here you see them both. Now just for your reference. We also have a point here. We can read out. The specific humidity. We can weed out the dry Billick temperature. Which is sixty degrees. And that is actually higher than the wet built temperature which is about thirty eight degrees. And that is found by following the blue arrow. Finally the relative humidity. You can find here it's zero point three. Is one of the it is represented by to curse. The entropy values. Can be found here on the diagonal lines. I bet summarizes my. Talk about psychometric. I showed you some definitions of moisture and. Temperatures. And I'd like to read Bill temperature. I'll explain to you. The process of. Idea Benteke separation very relevant for drying applications. I finally I introduced to you. Psychometric charts. And the more you diagram that are often used to design. Drawing systems.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I will discuss alternative concentration methods to evaporation main reason for using some alternative methods. Is because these provides retain a higher productivity. Or a better in terms of energy efficiency. Because doing if it breaks when there is a face transition. It goes a lot of energy. I want to turn it off method. Is freeze concentration. Which involves sparks of course to the station. Of water. And the old alternative method involves membrane separation. Frees concentration. I will discuss first. And actually people found out. Already centuries ago. That when you leave. A barrel. For example where the wind outside and it freezes over night. Then at the walls of the barrel an ice layer will be formed. Actually if you didn't make a hole in a barrel. And draw off. The wind. You'll find it is being concentrated. As a lot of water. Actually is transferred it transforms into ice. Which was retained in the ice layer. FROST. To divorce. How the principle works. Is here. At the left. While freezing. Ice crystals. Will be formed. Nuclei. Will be formed. And actually the nice thing is that these crystals form. In a rather pure form. Because only the water molecules fit into ice crystal lattice. Thereby. If this process goes slowly enough. He can create relatively pure crystals. So this would be suspension. Crystallization. Well here. You have Christianisation or ice formation and. A cold surface or for example. In the barrel. And so you get a nice ice layer. And on top of that. You have the liquid. That will become. Concentrate its. Now. A nice. Aspect of this. Concentration method. Is that nutritional and sense the recall of the properties. I very much retained. Especially a real mass which may call if I parades you in evaporation. Are much better retained. Then. It's not it's. Apparent that this type of effect of this type of concentration process is our plights for example to do says high fuel use wine beer. And coffee extract. So calm. Products that have FULL of tile compounds which are very critical to their quality. A disadvantage. Of freeze concentration. Is that high capital costs are involved. And also refrigeration calls. Are normally. Much higher then compared to heating costs. And also another important aspect. Actually is that. Until P.. Of. Sublimation are you know the entropy of. Freezing story. Is much lower then the entropy of evaporation. And so in principle this technique should be more energy efficient. But in practice because of. Expensive food for education course it is not always that explicit. How is this process being carried out. We have two types of operational modes. So the left side we have the film. Freeze concentration. Moats where a product. Is being distributed across falling film. Wife. So a film is actually created this film. Freeze is frozen and the ice layer is built up at the interior side of this pipe. Now then. If you see it relate this product. Along. The pipe. You'll get finally a concentrated liquid. And later on this. Tank is removed. And then you can melt the ice which deposits on the pipe. And you just remove it from the from the system. So this is not yet. Commercially applied system. While. The. Right system is a christian based on. Crystallizing in suspension. Isn't commercial a polite process. And it's supplied by or developed by the whole. And it left the festal. The crystals are being grown. Using suspension Christly station and by. Refrigerating the Devils and. The system is continuously Sturtz. And we have a mixed system that provides sufficient residence time. That allows the crystals to grow. Sequentially suspension of course as they stepped off and fed to a washing call of an indiscretion column. Bought of the crystals. Is being melt. And these melt is actually used in a sort of calm to current mult to wash the dishes spent on the surface of the crystals. Thereby allowing to obtain a rather pure water and. On the other side. Yielding a very concentrated products. I said this system is economically feasible. Although it is rather. Capital intensive. And therefore it's used for specific niche products where for example. A row must are five or two week thing. Now another type of concentration methods. Instead of evaporating. Using membrane separation. And then we talked for example about reverse osmosis or forward as Moses. And that is for example used in there for desalination or. For all our concentration. Operations in the food industry. At the right. Year reverse osmosis. We use a samey permeable membrane here. Memorable membrane. Allows only water to permeate we have here. Product solution or in this case a sole solution on the other side. We have pure water. Because all of the differences in. Chemical potential. Normally the pure water would flow. To the other sites. To do so. Water. However we prevented this by applying external or hydraulic force. To push water. Through the membrane. To keep you out of sight. Thereby. Harvesting or concentrating. It is sold well the solution. And creating more fuel water. On the contrary you can also carry out. For this most process. So here. You also again. Have a samey permeable membrane. With a pure water. On one side and a sole solution on the other side. And this case the product size would be this site where some components are the source here at the right site. And we have a very concentrated solution at the left side. And because of the pressure difference. Fuel water or water. Will permeate from the product. Into the very concentrated souls. Because of the smaller pressure difference. And so in effect this solution is a droll solution. That drools. Or pools. The water molecules from the right to the left side it's not at the bottom here. You can see. And initial skill. Installation of reverse osmosis. Membranes. Especially for dissemination applications we have huge spellbound type of. Models. About the reverse osmosis. We need to apply certain pressure to overcome. The small to pressure created by the molecules. And to be able to permeate. Only water. Through this samey permeable. A membrane. And we can also visualize that. In this equation. Where you have to pressure created by the presence of the molecules. And the hydraulic pressure that we need to apply. And the delta piece should be higher than it was mostly pressure. In order to be able to have a certain membrane flux. This the flex their muscles for resistance. And so did. Demosthenes for a coffee and finally we can obtain also. Flow rate. By multiplying the flux with the still surface area. I guess is a very nice method because it doesn't involve any face transition. The only problem here is that we need to apply at a certain moment at a certain concentration very high pressures as so. Which is not feasible any more. Now for example for way. People find that. Twenty eight percent of dry meth are of so let's concentrate and say you arrive ready at pressures of about forty bars. And that's not economically feasible any more to go beyond that concentration. Also for skim milk. It stops around thirty percent of the matter. As fish calls it the first a good mass transit for it with a membrane. So this limits the application. But if you don't for example the combined reverse of smokers with an event peroration step. Then you can cover the whole range of concentrations. If you talk about forward as Moses. You could imagine this layout. So here we have a product. For example of juice. The juices. Are permeates. Around. This bump. To the membrane module. And here. The juice is contacted me to draw a solution which is in this case a brine can also be a sugar solution. Which is also burned to rounds and. Water is actually pulled from the juice. Into the brine. Now you can imagine that. As the time proceeds then this brine will be called more. Diluted. Which will decrease the mass fanfare rate from the left to the right sized. So that's a limitation because then eventually did Brian need to be concentrated again for example using evaporation. Which makes energy efficiency again. Similar to evaporation processes. On the contrary I had a product quality is very much retained as the product is not exposed to high temperatures. This for the smoke is not yet commercially applied to large scales. Especially of a specially food. History. And maybe because of transfer limitations. Maybe because of monsters for limitations. But this concludes my talk about alternative energy effect concentration methods. I've shown you. Several types of for conservation methods fees concentration and membrane based separation. Concentration methods. Like reverse osmosis and fourth as Moses.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I will explain several aspects that are related to if a Parisian performance. First I will explain the difference between single effect and multiple effective separation. Then I will talk about again. Efficiency in using more of operators in series. Also I will discuss. Aspects. Concerning evaporator performance in relation to prod a quality and following. That may arise in. Evaporate us. Here at the left hand side on the slight. You can see a schematic drawing of a single effect evaporator. At the right hand side. You can see how it actually takes place in reality. And so this is a falling film evaporator. Where steam. Is fets. At the top. It's condensing. Against the pipes. And a coma Zeta's harvested. At the bottom of the feet is being distributed across this view the plate and. Drops down. Forming a nice homogeneous feel if everything goes right. And if a person that arises. Go flows. With the concentrate. To the bottom and here to concentrate on the favor. I being separate it's. This is them. Is a single evaporator. System. And so the steam. Actually ends up in a coma zet. And we produce a separate vapor stream. The amount of favor that you produce is more or less equivalent to the amount of steam that you supply. Actual disfavor is. Of pretty high quality. As its energy content. Is high. So you actually ideally would like to make use of this favor. Perhaps in the next evaporator. To. You have to keep a home. And make use of this energy that is. In that and bought it in that favor. It's actually not possible to refit it to the steam side. Because the temperature of the Faber is. The temperature as the product temperature of the liquid insights. Which makes that a driving force for heat transfer is zero. Had to remember the steam. Temperature should be always higher than the liquid temperature and this allows heat transfer. So actually. If we want to make a multiple effect if appraisement system. We need to use a lower pressure. In a second evaporator system. Here you see a double effect system schematically. But also a falling film evaporator system. Double Effect in reality. First the schematic. We have the feet and the steam supplied here on the left side. We have steam. Being condensed and harvesting accomplish that and if it is being. If that paraded. So we have a vapor. And a concentrate. The concentrate is set to the second. Effect. And also the vapor. Goes to the second a sect. Effect. But then is being applied as a steam. To transfer energy from the steam. To the product side. This approach. Makes a double use of the vapor. And so first we have a steam that we supply. Then the favorite comes out of this if a parade is used in a second while I had this making. Doable. Or being more doable to. Efficient. You should also realize that. In terms of product. Concentration. That remains. More or less similar. As we have a final target concentration which would be similar as to when we have only one. Effect system. To actually calculate the evaporator performance people creat op. Using the ratio of Fabre from the liquid feet and steam used. So that is defined as the Faber flow rate. Defied by the steam. Flow rates. The economy as I said before. Is actually approximately one. However if we have to do. Effect. Then we double also to energy efficiency. Which means that we have twice. If they prefer low. And only one time to steam use. So we end up with an energy efficiency of two. If we increase the number of evaporate this. Even up to and affect the separate assistance. We actually come up with an efficiency of and. Which is of course. Very much the starts. However it is not possible just to it's not economically feasible to place. Multiple effects. And effects. Next to each other from an analysis. You can actually do rife. That the surface area that you need to install and eat if a brighter. Is for each individual effect. Similar. As for one single effect thereby providing the capital cost will also increase dramatically. Even And. Times compared to single effects. And that makes it not economically feasible to have for example a tent effect of. Evaporation system. And practice we see that for large scale applications. A maximum number of five to six separate us. Is feasible. And many old R.P. cases even for double effect is already on the border. So it's a balance between the capital cost and energy costs. Another approach. To make more efficient operation. Is to use. Vapor recompression systems in the way we try to a great favor that arises from and evaporation system. Using either a thermal we compression or a mechanical vapor in compression. A mechanical vapor recompression uses a large or taking fan. The fan is more or less this white and it increases the pressure of this. Steam or the vapor in. In a mechanical way. The disadvantage of these mechanical. Vapor we compressed systems that are quite noisy. And also the electrical power consumption is rather high. However deficiencies really high. And these type of. Installations actually. Are comparable to a fifteen effect. Separation she's. System. I saw effect if you would now build in the vibration system with Radha. Opt for a mechanical fakery compression system. Now another approach is to use. Turmel vapor recompression. There. You use a high pressure steam in and injector to a great part of the favor to a higher pressure. So that you can refute it again to the feet side of the steam. This device is fake injector. Operates more or less in the same way as if they can inject or system multiple effect systems can be operated in different modes. Here you see a coker inflow we have the steam that's being supplied on this site. And a product. Flowing from the first. Effect. And then. To the second. Effect as well this is also what I presented you. On the previous light. However which you can also do not have similar. Flow. Direction. As the steam. But having an open seat flow direction. From the right. To the left so first defeat. Is provided to the second evaporator. And subsequently it is fed to the first effect. The main difference actually. Is that you need to install pump here. And that is because the first effect. Operates at a higher pressure. Than a second. Evaporator. So if you have a coker inflow product will go with the pressure drop to the second one. But if you have a Coke account a current flow. You need to overcome this pressure differences by installing a pump. So. You can make a comparison between the two. Operation months. And realizing that there is a pressure. Difference between the effects. Because of the boiling point. Also. Decreasing. Because we need to do that to be able to have a certain temperature difference each time. Between steam and product site. To be able to transfer heat. And so feet flow from the first to the second effect cetera. Because of the pressure drop. If you have a consequent flow. Then we need to install a pump. Now the advantage of a consequence of. Flow. Is that it is offended just from. Energy point a few. Because the temperature gradually increases. From right to left. Another advantage is that is for the fiscus products. Because of this cause it reduces at the high at elevated temperatures. And you go from right to left. Then the highest concentration will be in the first effect. Which also has the highest temperature. Thereby reducing the viscosity instill allowing you to do a decent. Evaporation process. However if you talk about. Products that fall for example. That contain many proteins. Then. It is more desired to have a coker and flow so going from the left to the right. By a concentrated solution. Experiences the lowest temperature. And finally a little bit about the product they call gauging the kind of core Of course. A procedure that uses heat or elevated temperatures. Because of the. Reduced pressure. We can use lower temperatures thereby avoiding public think would be a shame but it will still take place at some point. Especially with multiple effect systems. We have to have. We have to start with somewhat higher temperatures. I would can also be the case is that. At a certain moment especially June prolonged from running times. Falling will occur. For example here you see a schematic picture of a. Beth unlike the global in this case that. The natural rights and. Aggregates with all their milk. Components. And then finally makes. Deposits. On the surface of the heat exchanger. And the effect is that the heat transfer a call for shins. Will decrease. Thereby. We need to increase the STEAM cause emotion to still be able to achieve a certain. Evaporation rate. And now of course it is not very much desired so at a certain moment. We'll have to clean the whole system. And start all over again. That's right you can see an example of a fall to falling film if I break it you. Having said this. I would like to conclude here. Showing you. Several aspects that are related to have a breakthrough or a performance. You can do single and multiple effect if. There's a balance between. Energy savings that you can make using multiple effects and capital costs that are involved in installing multiple effect systems. You can also go through alternative methods like FE probably compression systems. And finally when you evaluate if I break the performance you also have to take into account. Effects and product quality but also for example. Following issues that might limit. If a parade performance because you need to clean clean at some point.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I would like to share with you. Technique of evaporation. In many processing industries. If separation is used as a technique to remove. Solvents from a solution or suspension. In this way we can recover. Both. The solvent. And the water for example. And obtain a concentrate. A concentrated solution. There are two different types of evaporation but ration processes. In the case we want to separate to solvent from each other then. We talk about for example distillation. This is one possibility or. We can use evaporation. To fractionate solvent. From Seoul Utes. And so the soft components like for example concentrating a super solution. If you talk about. Distillation. Then you talk for example. About making a distillate. Think about making a room or a whisky if you talk about it all the time of concentration and you talk for example about a concentration. Using evaporation. For example to concentrate apple juice. Most of the applications with in food industry are considered to be the second type of separation. And so concentrating solar it's. Dissolved in a solvent and then mostly we talk about concentration of. Atreus. Solutions. On the next light. I will explain or explain you. The principle of evaporation. Actually it is a relative simple process. It's a matter of partial mass transfer. Off a boiling solution. So here you see a solution. A true solution. That boils at its boiling point. You see that Faber bubbles. Nucleate. And rise to the top. Where to favor fresh off. So if there would be dissolved components present in the liquid face it would get more and more concentrated because the vapor is removed it's actually quite an elegant process. Because you only remove the pure. Solvents. As such that you get a very effective. Separation of the two. And confess for example membrane separation process is often. Are troubled by some leakage of the other components. The only case when you might have. For example losses of components are if there are volatile. Components present in the liquid. They might go evaporate. You and evaporation one of the disadvantages of this process is that you have to apply. Heat a lot to actually be able to carry out the face transition to do. The boiling and to face mission from liquid to vapor. That costs a lot of energy. Moreover because of the elevator temperature this can have a mental effect on the product quality. The principle of evaporation. Of course. Elaborate the skill. Is somewhat different. But this is how it is carried out. At the large scale industry of scale. There is a schematic drawing here. And we actually count carry out a boiling. By transferring heat. Which is supplied to fire. Steam flow. To heat exchanger and a steam will condense in it here exchanger and to earth. Transfer its heat. To the boiling liquids. These boiling liquids. Then. Partially favorite is the favor. Is transferred here. Or removed at the top. While the product. Concentrate. Is harvested. At the bottom of the steam that is supplied. Is condensed. Primarily transferring its latent heat and a condensate is also collected to get. And so. From the feet stream the water is evaporated. While the so let's. Are retained. Within the products. And thereby we actually concentrate. The products. Take a note of the symbols here. This. Flow rate flow rate. And adult. Means that we talk about the rates. We also have a temperature of the city. Which is equal to the temperature of Goma Zeta only latent heat is transferred. We also hear half a soulless concentration in Quito per kilo. Total and we have of course the corresponding temperatures. Please note that the steam circuit is a closed circuit. So it's not in physical contact with the products. And so the heat is transferred through the wall of the heat exchanger. In a system. To create. Viki him. Which is actually required to carry out the borning at a reduced. Boiling temperature. Which is beneficial to preserve the product quality. We need to condense the favor and subsequently the use of a Q injector. To create lower pressure. To carry out for example boil it boiling at the temperature below sixty degrees. Where protein unites ration. Is occurring less. Now let's dive a little bit more into detail to these two devices so we have a favorite condenser. Which we moved to favorable densest of paper. Here you see how a condenser is constructed. At an interest and skill. It's a by piece exchanger. Where the Faber. Effects on the shell site. And in the pipes. We have cooling water. Which is supplied here at the right site. While the favor is flowing along the pipes. It's condenses and the Camilla's eight. Is obtained at the bottom. And in it gases are obtained. At the outlets. He's you know guesses are subsequently fat too. If they can be director. Which converts the pressure energy of a motor flew it. Which is for example. A water jets into and. Under pressure and this actually the Garces it creates an under pressure. Especially in this so in order to set or to fix. Of a Q. and A set the. Fakin is very useful. Because that allows us to carry out. If I pray she. At a lower pressure. And this. At a lower. Point. Now I will give some examples. Off. Evaporator systems that are being used in industry. We have three types of evaporation systems we have a natural. Circulation the separators. Sometimes force. If the circulation separates river forced the circulation evaporated. And we have. Falling film evaporates. Not first a natural relation type. Here you see just defies in effect. The flu it's sick relates here. Through the heat exchanger. Which is called Columbia. It's another term for heat exchanger heated through it. Heat it. Together with along the pipes. It's super heated here. And in favor flex yourself. And here is the dunk warmer. As you get a natural circulation. Because of density differences. And if a for bubbles that rise. Causing the convection. And you get a nice. Circulation flow. And fit for a station. Now this type of evaporated. Mostly suitable for crystallizing applications. As crystals. Have a sufficient residence time. To be able to grow. Does it found its product resides. Quite a long time therefore. So for example for very fragile products you tend to use a different type of evaporator. Now this is an application of that in the natural or forced to relation evaporator. This is. Production during sugar refinery. The sugar used is concentrated for from fourteen to seventy percent. By Federation. And their bottles so. Exceeding to silly billeted limit of sugar. And by adding some fine she would crystals. You can actually slowly grow initiate and grow. Crystals food. Their final size. And especially because of the long residence times evaporated type. Is quite perfect for these type of applications. Here you see an example of a new this is scale facility. Then we have the four circulation. Evaporated type. This one is for example used in the salt industry. I'll talk about that the next slide. The principle. Is that here. We have the heat exchanger. Which is provided. We have to call those eight outlets. And in this heat exchanger the fluids or the sole solution is super heated. And then. This pipe is thing going Chile fed into the Federation chamber and. In the operation timber. Thereby we have all source who are earning motion of the fluids wild if a professional off and the suspension with the crystals. Is going down in the dunk. And then here it has been to get around. The sick relation rates are very high. Actually to prevent. Also falling in these type of systems. Actually to take relation rates or the flow rates can be up to sixteen thousand. But hour in these type of systems. You can imagine that if I practice are really large in size and. Easily if it breaks and jam but would fit in the size of a big room. So the advantage of this system is that it also allows to quickly station implications and there are high velocities to prevent falling. A disadvantage is that these type of agreements are very costly. Because of their. Huge size. And therefore they are. And they involve high capital costs. So this is the implication. I'm not sure whether you're familiar with the fact that there is a SOLD layer beneath Western Europe. And at some spots for example hang low and they'll sell. The spots are pretty high and. People apply. Solution mining. To harvest. The sole solution situated source from. Or. Also called. Bright. And these briny subsequently. Purified using Presby Taishan reactions. To remove all our souls then sodium chloride. As you do then. Remain with the solution of sodium chloride. For about twenty five weight percent. And this solution is subsequently treated during multiple effect effect for a sion. To actually crystallize and harvest the salts. And then you get a final salt product. Now also. Multiple effect if I prayed as I used. Actually to increase the efficiency. Off. And evaporate a system. And that's being done. Up to five to six evaporated even in a row. From each evaporator. Slurry is obtained. Which is. Subsequently centrifuges and rights to obtain the salt crystals. Then the final. Evaporator which is used at the New to skills the falling film evaporator. This is the type of fat bread especially used in dairy industry and is pretty tall it's also four to eight meters in length and well. And this this evaporator type. Actually starts with the feeding off the product at the top. And a product full flows. Inside the pipes you with in a thin film. Along the inner side of the pipes done where it's. The steam. Is actually supplied from the shell side. And eat. It is steam condenses. On the other side of the by heat is transferred to the inside of the to the product. Where the product starts boiling. And even if the rep orating. Then the product. Together with the fader flows down. And at the bottom of the falling film evaporator. We have already a partial separation. To concentrate and. The vapor. But also large amounts of concentrated favor. Will in fact. Be separated into separate separation chambre. Not on the vapor. Scapes through the top. While the concept of. It is harvested at the bottom not very critical to this type of evaporated. Is that the product needs to be well distributed amongst different pipes. Because otherwise you have in one pipe a very thick layer and all the pipe. Almost no layer. And it will lead to quick falling and. Therefore you have to shut down the equipment and clean it again. Another advantage is that the residence time of the products very short. Which minimizes the heat load on the product. And this pressure of the protocol at the best. And it's a lose. Used a lot in the food industry. And especially as I said before in a dairy industry. Now I want to pull application is for example to concentrate milk. Actually THAT PEOPLE ALREADY STARTED DOING SO hundred fifty years ago. Especially because it's very difficult to keep that for. Now in storage for. Some days. Even after that it's you get spoiled and so people found out that especially if you use. Heaps of sugar you add the two to do. To the milk the concentrated milk. That you actually can store your milk products for a much extended time and in fact if you use. Or if you add sugar. And you also lower the water activity. And thereby avoid that Michael going isn't spoil the concentrate. If you just have the condensed milk. Then. Already. The exposure. To temperature higher temperatures. Kills the present microorganisms. And thereby you can also keep these concentrated milk for a longer time. Another application. And actually that's being used also often. Is that you combine evaporation with drying. And so for example for the production of. Infant or or baby food. People start off with making a pre-mix. I would consist of. Several ingredients to mimic the human milk. Then they carry out a concentration step using a notable effect. Leaders. Have for example this is a for effect the following film if I prayed our system. Here schematically here. More in practice. And then if you achieve concentration fifty to sixty one percent. Then people spray dried it into a powder. Not why why do the first you see the operation is because evaporation is much more energy efficient than a final drying. Now concluding evaporation in the food industry. Is a very widely used it's a very selective method to remove our water. While concentrating. Your original soul it's information. However it is quite energy consuming and. It is elevated temperatures. Can impact the product quality. I discussed several. Evaporated types like the natural. Sick relation evaporator. The forced circulation separated and a falling film evaporator. Finally I gave you some examples also Wolf. There are P.K. ssion such as the concentration of milk way. And juices. But also the production of crystals like Ferguson of sugar and salt.",

                "text": "Hello. In this knowledge clip. I will explain you. About the design of the single effect if that greater. Here at the left. You can already see a schematic drawing of the. Evaporator. While designing and single effect if that greater. We make use of several assumptions. To actually facilitate or to make life a little bit more easy. The first ascension. Is if we assume no boiling point elevation. To boiling point elevation. Is related to the fact that the boiling point of. Solution. Is a little bit higher. Then the boiling point of a pure water system. If your water system is for example is one hundred degree Celsius. While for a solution it will be a little bit higher. However because many food systems. Comprise particularly. Higher and more likely compounds. We can safely assume this. Most of the time to boiling point elevation is about zero point two zero point five degrees Celsius. However if we for example concentrate. The sold or. Sucrose solution and we go to very high concentrations. Then you might run into the differences are problems that say. Another assumption is that we assume stationary operation. Of the evaporator. Which means that we do not include. In our design calculations. Starting orders should down. Often evaporator system so we just operate it in a steady state. A third assumes and. Is that we assume that. Faber and the liquid face. In the if I prayed for idea mixed. Which means that the liquid the temperature of the liquid inside the separator. Is equivalent to the temperature of the vapor which escapes from the liquid and. Is also equal to the outgoing. Product or liquid. However it is not equal to the. Feet. Temperature. So you should be. Lies that. Forth assume is that there is no heat lost studio environment. And so on through the walls or the evaporator. No heat will be transferred. And so we just. Only transfer heat. Fire to flows. Going in and out of the system. So in fact we have well insulated. Evaporators. If we make decisions. We can make use of a mouse and. Energy balance just to design an effective single effective separator. So here at the right again. A single effect if at Breda schematically draw. We have two systems which are physically separated. We have the steam being fed to the heat exchanger. Which is part of the Federated design. And heat exchanger. Is defined. With a certain surface area and. A specific heat transfer called fission and a steam will condense. In this heat exchanger. And thereby transferring its heat to the liquid inside. And a condense will. Will remain. Actually it is interesting to know that the temperature of the steam. Will be more or less equal to the temperature of the coma States because only the latent heat. Is being transferred to the other sites. I said that's why these temperature. Is the same in both accommodate and steam. That's not always the case I should say. Because some temperature decrease can occur here. But the relative contribution of energy. Being transferred is relatively low. Now then we have. Defeats. That is entering the system. But it shouldn't pull that fraction and so the must flow rate is fed to the effect right or. The Faber escapes here at the top. At a certain flow rate and a product is harvested here at the bottom of the product site and a steam side are two separate. Physically separated systems it's important to realize only heat is transferred across the walls of the heat exchanger. If you now want to design a single effective operation. We use a system boundary. Here you can see the purple. Daughter it's. Books. And that's what we consider to be. The system and. All flows going in and outside. Through the walls of the system. We consider for setting up their demands and he balances. Not here. I depict it. Together with a schematic drawing. The balances. So first at the top. We have to dry so let's balance. The demand of sorts that enters the system is going via the feet. And it should be equal to the amount of solids that lead to system. Of products. No solids will evaporate. I did is only valid and it's most that their case is valid as they so let's are generally not. Volatile. It's only when you have a volatile compound compounds these made may not be the case. But in our cases we generally assume that the solids. Retained in a product. Then we have the total mass balance. That is made of the feet. The Sapre flow and product flow. And so no steam or commissary flows are included here because they are physically separated systems. It's also important to realize that the. Feet and the product solids fractions. Are expressed. Per kilo. So let's. Perky love. Total amount of solution. Now we have an out of balance or so we also going to set up the energy balance. Or the entropy balance. That is stated here. At first we have to feed part. Then we have to steam it entropy content of the steam. Then we have to favor. From the top. We have the product. And we have to compensate. And so these are all the flows that go in and the. As are all of those that leave the system. Important to realize here. Is that H.. Is the entropy constant of each stream. And as expressed in the unit the kido. And the next lights I will explain a bit more this in detail. And of course also we have the temperatures of the steam and. Temperature well. Which is the temperature inside. The evaporate and that's the same as the temperature of the outgoing product and the vapor. As explained before. So the entropy content of this is this small. H.. And if you multiply it with the mass flow rate you'll take the total entropy. Off the office three mm. Now this is the entropy of the feature tree. And we can calculate that. Or at least we can calculate entropy content. Because it's a function of the temperature and of all its composition or the field composition. That fits. This function is actually. Again. Function of the specific heat off the stream multiplied with a temperature difference. And then this is the actual temperature in Kelvins of the feet and. To zero. Is the standard. Temperature So this is a reference temperature and we agreed that this temperature. Two hundred seventy three point fifteen Kelvin. Is a reference temperature that we use for these type of. And will be calculations. So actually the temperature difference. We flex the temperature in degrees Celsius. And then we want to calculate the. Specific heat off a Feed stream. Could also be another stream. And that's actually you can calculate that from the specific heat of the individual components present in the feed. And the the mass fractions of the different components. Here you have for example. The specific heat of water. Protein and ash which. You see that these things are much lower than entropy content of water. So generally For example if you consider the separation of milk. Your. And all of your specific heat. It will be about three. Now in our last longest way. We can also calculate the entropy contents of the product and accommodate provided commentators a bit more simple. Because it just only contains water. Then we also need to know the entropy contents or for the that the. Faber and steam. So here at the top you see the tolls the entropy of the steam. Which is equivalent to the flow rate of the steam not apply to the entropy content. And this is then. Can be further. Detailed. By this to specific heat part of the steam so it's actually. Heating up. Water from zero degrees Celsius two hundred degrees Celsius and. The latent heat. Part of the entropy of the steam. Actually the value of the entropy content you can also obtain from the steam table. Which is shown here below. And depending on the pressure of the steam as Additionally the atmospheric pressure. But a temperature of the steam is Hundred we Celsius. We have a specific for you. Which is the inverse of the density of the steam. Which is actually pretty low for City. But then. We have a specific heat part. Which is the four hundred ninety kilos you pick. Kilo. We have the evaporation part entered it if appraising entropy which is much higher. Which makes of the total the total steam. Until the. You see that. The specific heat part of four hundred nineteen. Is much lower compared to the operation and will be. Not the same you can also do. For the vapor that's being released from the from the evaporator. Although this will be at a. I to lower temperature. That summarizes the balances so we have a dry sort of balance those amounts balance. And entropy balance. These are three equations. With eleven an ounce and to be able to solve the system. Several things have to be supplied or. To be known. And it's often the case fortunately so you can solve the system effort simple calculate the amount of steam that you need to evaporate. Until a certain probably concentration. Then also for evaporator. You may want to specify the surface area for if it breaks and we quite. And then you need to define the amount of heat transfer it. And its Q You mount of heat transfer to killers you'll have a second. And that's proportional to the heat transfer coefficient. H.L.V.. The surface area of the heat exchanger. And the temperature difference between the steam site. And the liquid side. Now that should be equal to the. Entropy difference between the steam. That is entering and accommodate that is leaving. The system. The transfer of call fission is build up of the heat transfer fissions. Across both the coolness a film. Across the steel wall and across through the product film. These two are pretty straightforward. However the heat transfer coefficient for the product side is a bit more complex because it depends on the boiling behavior of the products. And of course one tries to find the optimal. Or the highest. Heat transfer course is possible and on price to thing to optimize that in that sense. A bit more explained on the parameter values where that means. The surface area of a square meter. And here. The parameter values. The coefficients. The transfer of call fissions. And this is the ratio of the steel wall thickness over the connectivity of the steel. I should mention here that you and H. Ovi. Are. Effect. The same they are both be presenting. Heat transfer of coffee shit. And then a small example how to design an evaporative system. And in this example. Actually show the combination of events rate or the need for Prater with a heat exchanger. That is a very often. A combined. System because the data actually used to predict defeat. Of the entering. Now of the entering products. That is being concentrated. We need to show. What is the heat of the steam calls in Sion. If we want to achieve. Final product on the trade of zero point three five. We have also been provided with the heat capacities of water and. All of the solace in the indices to. Now for debts. For the design we start with an overall system. System boundaries across both evaporator and heat exchanger. And we consider. In the outgoing. Flows for the miles ballast. And the balances. So here we see the soulless balance. Defeat. Equally equal. The product. Because solid to not disappear Vita vapor. Because later the total balances. The total balance. The fee to be equal to the vapor. And the product. And we conclude with the heat that heat balance. Defeat. The end of the of the feet. Plus the entropy of the steam should equal the entropy of the vapor. The product and steam. We calculate. First the product. Flow rate from the solids balance. Because we know all the other variables in this equation. And we obtain a product. Flow rate of two point six percent and then. We use these value. To calculate the flow rate of the vapor. And finally we calculate. All the entropy values of the stream. You'll see that entropy of the feet is so much lower than that of the product. And we have the added P. of the owners eight it's actually not accomodate at least the separator but at least. The heat exchangers already. It has decrease in temperature and. Hide it or transfer to eat. To preach defeat. But actually. We're not considering this. Into media to come as a flow. Because we only consider the overall system balance. And that is actually. Sufficient to solve the entire system as. The remaining entropy balance has only one unknown. And that is the steam. Flow rate which is three point eight percent. So we get. We actually calculated. What would be required steam flow. For concentrating. Until a final concentration of. Zero point thirty five feet up a kilo. I would that. I would like to conclude. My presentation. I've shown you how to design a single effect evaporator. By using and defining mosse and until P balances. And by doing so you can actually specify the steam flow or to steam that is required to consecrate until sort of final concentration. In addition. I also showed you how to define a surface area for example. By considering the transfer of heat between steam. And products.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. You will learn about multi effects evaporation. Multiple effect if abrasion. Is a strategy. Or an approach to effect increased energy efficiency doing evaporation and all the knowledge slips you learnt about single effects. If I pray sion. Which just comprises simply the evaporation. In one step. And in this presentation I will tell you about the multiple effects if I break in principle. And how to design a multiple effect. Evaporators. And then. For example a double effect. Evaporator. On the next. Sleights. Here. You can see a double effect. Evaporate there are a system. On the left. You see the first effect. Evaporator. On the right hand side. You see the second. Effect. Evaporator. Here this is the first effect. Where the steam. Is added to the heat exchanger. And heat exchanger has a certain surface area. And he turns for a coffee shop and the steam condenses in this. He thinks things are and thereby provides or transfers its energy. To liquids. In the evaporator. Here on this site. You see. Defeat which is supplied with a certain. Fraction and a certain. Flow rate. At a certain temperature is fed to the evaporator in the evaporator. We assume that there's an idle mixed. System. Which means that the temperature of the liquid inside is in equilibrium. Or so the same as the temperature of the Faber and also the temperature of the outgoing liquids. Going. Concentrate. Has the same temperature. In a double effect. System. And if concentrated is being produced. Is fed to the second. Evaporator. In the second effect evaporator. The product is further concentrated. Until its final product the concentration. Here. Be too. And concentration that is reached is X. be too. Now the nice thing off a multiple effect. System is that you. Re use the fader again. To evaporate in a second. Evaporator. So you see here. Escaping vapor. Which is actually. Also steam. But then. At a lower temperature. Then is steam. At this site which is fact set. To the first evaporator. And then it is used and second. System where to favor condenses. It is indeed heat exchanger and evaporator to having a surface area. And of course also heat transfer. Go fishing. I dismissed them. But also have equilibrium. The temperature of the vapor. And outgoing. Product is the same and. Finally we update. Our product concentrates and. Faber condenses. And its taint as a condensates. The fact that you need to have two separate systems. Instead of just reusing this. Favor in the first effect. The reason for that is. Is that they have a favorite temperature here. Is lower than the temperature here. If this favor would be referred to this if I break the system there is no temperature difference. Across the heat exchanger. There's no driving force for. Evaporation. Or heat transfer. So in this system. A lower pressure needs to be applied. Also to be able to carry out an evaporation process. And so the boiling temperature. If we juiced and so therefore. There's a fake him or a lower pressure applied to decide. Also if we have more. Effects. Then. Continuously a lower. Boiling temperature prevails. At a lower pressure. Now how are we going through these. I'm such a movable effect system. We do that often first by defining and whole system boundary. And that's really. We start with an overall system boundary. We can also defined ship systems that lets us first start with a system boundary across the whole system. And now we're going to set up. Mosques and he does and says. To be able to calculate for example. The amount of steam. That we need to arrive at a certain product of concentration. Here you see the mass and he balances. For double effect. System. And so we start here with the total balance. Which comprises. On the one hand. On the left side. Defeats the flow rate. And on the right side it contains the vapor. Flow from the first effect. Which is actually the same as the coma as a flow. Because actually does is the flow that you need to include in your balance. Also to favor flow from the second. Effect and. The product flow rate. Which leads to the second. Effect through the system boundary. So that's the whole system. Then we also have to this Dr Sol it's a mass balance. Which is very simple and not all of us through the. Single effect. Operate the system so we just have the amount of solace that enters the first effect. And it should be equivalent to the amount of sorts. That leaves. The second. Effect. Now that concludes the mass balances. Then we also have an entropy. Balance. And so be that enters on the is on the left side. And so that's the feet. Plus the ends of P. from the steam. And that should be equivalent to the ends of pecans and. Of the products. Plus the coldness eight. Leaving first. Effect. Which is this one is a red arrow. We have to fade from the second. Effect which is this one. And finally. We have to compensate. From the vapor. That condenses in the second heat exchanger and leave the system. At the bottom. So this. Defines the whole system. Being the overall. Within the overall system boundaries. However it's not always sufficient. To have only. The overall system being considered. And sometimes you actually want to define subsystems. To generate additional equations. To be to actually solve a certain problem. It's because the two systems are connected and you have some degrees of freedom to change. Defeat from the one system to the other system. So we can actually define to Sister. Subsistence. The first effect. And a second effect. And normally. You choose to define a soup system which you want to address for example if you want to calculate the outgoing product. Concentrate you need to consider subsistent too if you want to consider the steam flow. You need to consider subsystem well. Not to get or. The overall balances animals balances and balances. Across subsystem to find a whole system. Actually it is not it makes no sense to use both the two subsistence and the overall system. As in that case. Actually the difference between the overall system and a subsystem is on a loss or it is equal to to subsist than one. But just to give an general overview of all the mass and he balances are provided here. So here we have the most balances. Around subsystem won. The overall balance and so let's miles a balance. We also have to subsist M P balance which comprises. Both defeats and esteem that is supplied to first effect. And what comes out is immediate. Products and will be content until people intent of the Colemans ate that Lisa system. And the favor flow from the first effect. Now also for. Effect to we can do a similar thing. We have done. Total miles about it's for effect. To this so let's Smalls balance and end up the balance. So for all the flows. That leaf or enter. Subsistence. To now. I will try to give an example. To actually demonstrate a. Cation of these equations. Because only when you actually carry out such an exercise exercise your thoughts on being able to view Dr Mohsen energy balance is but you're also. Able to apply. Six miles and energy balance as I recall so I did that to be very important. And this example. We consider the concentration of electric acid solution which could be for example the concentration of a fermentation broth. And we are going to design a system. To actually show that using this. Settings actually which I depicted here. We can achieve a final product concentration. Electic acid concentration of twenty three wait percent. Not of course we need to have some data. Around a specific heats and for water. It's four point two kg if you will to Cuba Kelvin. I feel like that as if it's much lower. It's around one point three kilos you'll pick a little guilty. Some dot that is provided. On the right hand side. For example. We have the steam flow. We have to feed flow. We have some data. If it breaks or the of the entropy contents of both. The first effect. Saper. And a second effect favor. And we also have some high temperatures of the condensates. The question to us is to show or to prove that. With the settings we can achieve these fine. Concentration. We could also have asked you for example. To calculate the outgoing concentration but that requires a lot of. Filling around with equations and so on you have to subsist you'd want equation into another. And to prevent you from doing that. We follow this route. And so first we start always were a bit lazy let's say just start with the overall system boundary. Across the two effects. I was going to set up the balance. Now on the next light. You see that actually. Here is the so let's balance. And by filling in the values. We can actually directly. Show that the product flow. Which is actually. Unknown. We reach was unknown. Is zero point six kilos or second. Subsequently we set up. The total miles about once. And we see that we actually remain with two unknown. The favor flow from first effect. And a favor flow from the second effect. So we leave that as such. So then we continue with the entropy balance. As I also said of our drive with you before. We calculate the individual and a piece of the different streets. Using the specific heat of the water and electric as it were using their relative compositions. And of course. We use. The temperature difference. Using the reference temperature two hundred seventy three Kelvin. Not only and up with the entropy values. And we are going to feel these failures in. To the equation and to the balance equation. And then. We obtain this equation. Also with two unknowns. But because these are the same. Unknowns. As in the first equation. We can actually solve this equation together with the other one. And we cannot think of those for the. Vapor flow rate from the two effects. Now we calculated those fateful flow rates but we did not actually provide a. Yes so that we are going to do. By defining a subsystem. So we need to define a subsistent to get actual proof. That is twenty three way percent. Solution can be achieved. So also for the subsystem. We choose. Subsystem to hear. Actually because we're interested in the product concentration. We first start with a dry solids must balance. Which provides the relationship. Here between. The intermediate. Concentration of the product between the two effects. And the mass flow rate in between. We don't know actually anything about it yet. But by combining this with the total mass balance. We can actually do rife. That product. Fraction. Into meta product fraction is open fifty kilo. And the mass flow rate. We can also obtain thirsts. When we didn't fill in the entropy balance. We have all known sexually so that means if the. If both sides of the equations. Are equal to each other then. What we find here actually. We actually proved that we can indeed reach a twenty three way to percent. So that's actually nice. Because in this way. Without too much feeling a round of equations. We can calculate these type of calculations. And so I think if you wouldn't have known in the twenty three way percent it will be a bit more complex. So normally people tend to use. For example spreadsheet calculations to design the type of systems. Now finally of course I showed you now for two to two effects. Systems. But you can also extrapolate that to three or even more effects. Not to conclude actually. My presentation. I demonstrate. If you do how to design a multiple effect system. I demonstrated that. While using it to affect SR. But you can also extrapolate that to multiple effects. You design. And if I break the system. By using mass. And entropy balances. And with this approach you can assess for example you might of. Dean that you have to use. To be able to achieve a certain product concentration or. You can calculate how much steam you know how much. Steam you have to supply or. How much from a concentration level chief. Well have a consistent steam supply.",

                "text": "In this. Nose clip. I will explain. State diagrams of fuel substances. And I will focus on water and carbon dioxide. A state diagram tells us in which. State a certain phases. You see a state diagram. With temperature and pressure axis. And she different regions with gas liquids and solids. Besides you see. It will be in lines. Where we have to face to face this together. But two phases are integral it will be him. A state diagram. Tells us what happens when we change the temperature or the pressure. Then. France is going from gas to liquid. We see. The transition. It's called condensation or. Case of going from Sol it. To liquid. We see the melting line. We cross the melting line. Here we see a critical point. I will explain it later and. We have the. Eutectic. Point. Or triple point. That three faces. There are coming together. So you can have the solid the liquid and the gas face together. Here see the state diagram for carbon dioxide. And for water. The main difference between the two. Is the slope of the. Melting line. For carbon dioxide. It's a forward melting line. And for water. It's backward. Negative slope. First one for. Substances which behave. Similar to carbon dioxide. But the forwards. Melting slope. Assuming you're at the. An equilibrium between solid and liquid. And your grease. The pressure. The system will move towards the soul the face. It will move to the soul its face because the Soul the face takes less space. And at higher pressure. The system wants to go to the site where. The Folio. Is smaller. So there is a slot if it's solidification. In order to come back to the. Librium line. Back to the melting. Line. You have to increase the temperature. So go to the right. So you see that an increased temperature will lead to an increased. Melting temperature. For the situation of water. This is difference. Here we see a negative slope. For this same. Melting or freezing line. The reason is that the density of solid water of ice is lower than the density of water. So solid face. Takes more space than the liquid face. Assume again. We are at this eclipse I am so sure we are at point B. and B. increase the pressure. Then. More water will be formed. So at this point. The system moves to the site with a smaller volume. Because of this higher pressure. When we want to reestablish. Equilibrium. We have to reduce the temperature. So we see does work in the reduced. Melting temperature. So we can say at the higher pressure. The melting temperature is lower. Then another transition. The boiling. Evaporation. So now we talk about this line. And here you see the effect of temperature. On the separated Fabre pressure. At boiling. The rest equilibrium between. The set. Rated favor pressure. And the external pressure and. The movement of molecules. Going from the liquid. To the. Gus face. Is same as movement movement back to the liquid face. At the higher pressure. The boiling temperature. Will be higher. And we use this in. Sterilization processes. In the sterilization process we want to apply. A temperature of at least hundred twenty degrees. But we don't want to try on the face transition to a gulf we still want to keep our product in the liquid face. So we can use this higher pressure to establish a higher. Boiling. Temperature and. We can apply a prior temperature of hundred twenty degrees without any golf formation. On the other side. A lower temperature and lower pressure will lead to a lower boiling temperature. And this we use in evaporation processes. We can boil. We can if ever at the water. At the temperature of said. Let's say sixty degrees centigrade. At the lower pressure. This way we can remove water in an evaporation pressure. In any for. Evaporation process where we don't have to heat the product. To very high temperatures. So we don't damage the product. That much. Then this critical point in the top of the graph. You see there is no distinction anymore. Between. The solid. And it cost face. And show you start. In a gust face. And you increase the pressure. And you are at the temperature higher than the the critical temperature. The particles will come closer together. And the density of the girls will increase. But it's. It's not becoming a lick. It's because it has no face transition anymore. The other way. Starting from a liquids and. Increasing the temperature. So. Liquid at high pressure. Going to a lake with. At even higher temperature. Also here to particles. Will separate. Further from each other the density of the liquid will decrease. And at some point that in this region. That then the densities of the Gus and the liquid bit. Will be more or less similar. So there is no distinction anymore and. RICH No barf I separate. Well of course this depends on the interim. Molecular forces. So the level of this point. Depends on the type of substance you are working with. Then another transition from Sol It took us. Sublimation we know this example especially from carbon dioxide. At atmospheric conditions. So in this region. Below. Well at. At one atmosphere. Carbon dioxide. Will be in the cost eight. But never be decreased the temperature. So going to the left. Coming below temperature of seventy eight degrees minus seventy eight degrees. It will come in the solid state. When we want to bring it in a liquid state. You have to apply a very high pressure. So. We don't know. Carbon dioxide in the liquid phase but we know it's in the solid and in the cost eight bit. The dry ice. That brings me to the conclusions. Of of this knowledge tip of the state diagrams tells us in what. Faces a certain substance can exist. And the equilibrium lines. They tell us which face transitions will occur. At certain temperatures and pressures.",

                "text": "In this clip we will discuss. Trends in Boston for which is must win for the changes in time. Which is quite relevant for the production of a lot of food products. Some food products where French and mussels for is really important. Are For example traditional products like for example. The curing of Ham where salt has Cicely fused into the products. Over and over a number of weeks. To take two to make sure that the product can then be drives safely. Another example is the salting of herring. Where which is in the Netherlands very in faery famous product but also in other countries it is it is well known. And here. You immerse. The herring. In a brine solution and also there the salt needs to diffuse. In to the product over several days. And many other products you actually have to remove Like for example. In sausages which we can dry. Over maybe the course of several weeks or even months. And here you want to get rid of the moisture which is present at the beginning. And which is then. Evaporated into disarray on the atmosphere. Let's have a look at how this works in practice. So if you consider this all such we may represent this with the help of this yellow block. And here the moisture has to diffuse out of the center of the sources. Towards the surface and then. Will be taken up by the air. The transports. In the sauce it has to be completely diffuse of course because you cannot make a solid matrix. And therefore we can use either the more comprehensive diffusion equation or we can use the. Simple one which is the one that we will use here. So does mine as a diffusion coefficients times the gradient. In the location of the concentration of. The moisture. On the outside. We have guests. Air and. We actually apply. A flow of air around it and therefore we have to use the relation for convective must transfer. Which is equal to minus. The muscle for coefficients times the difference in concentration. Between the interface. And the milk. Of. Of the of the gas fish. Of course if there is no accumulation on this interface. Deflection going out of the source it's. To be equal to deflection. Going into the gas face. So while we can equate these two relations then to each other the diffusion. Equation for the sausage. Is given here. And the smaller flux of the moisture going out of course then should be equal to the model of flux going into the air. So this will describe how the more she will leave the sausage. However we need to convert these. Concentrations because these articles and tray sions. Into the in the air and. If we look into the source which we should actually convert these concentrations into those concentration that would be adequate Librium. With those air concentrations in the sausage. So we actually have to use the distribution go fish and. So the EL the. A concentration in the guest face has to be converted by using the M. and then M. Time C P. Concentration. In the sausage. Is equal to. C L. If we do that we can now be rife. The velocity of moisture transfer from the sausage. Into the air. And we do this by. First converting the location into sausage which was zero. In the center. And which was are. The typical of the radius on the outside of the sausage. By dividing it by the thickness of the sources and that has found its. That's still the value is zero as in the center. But on the surface it will not be one. So the. After the behavior or any type of sausage or similar product. Which has the. Varying dimensions. Of course if we add. The D.C. year we also have to add it on the other side. And now we enter with a relation which gives these gradients being equal to the difference in concentration. Between the guest face and. The interface. Times. A factor. Which we call to be zero number. Represented by B R. And this B.-O. number. Is very important it actually gives a ratio between the internal diffusion and the outside convection. It's equal to the muscle for coefficients. Times. This distribution coefficient times the size of the diameter of the of the of the source it's divided by. The diffusion goldfish and. So as I said it's basically a rate show. Between the resistance. For diffusion inside the sausage. Divided by the resistance for external mouse fronts for which is which which which was dominated by convection. So if it's very small. It means that there's not a lot of resistance inside. And therefore most of resistance will be outside of the sausage. While if it's very large. Then. Most of the resistance will be inside the sources. The Meo number is not only seen with muscles for but also with the trends for and there actually it was equal to the heat transfer Co for sometimes a dimension divided by the heat connectivity. Of the of the product in Muslims for it's exactly the same. It's the miles from for coefficient of course in this case. Times the diameter of the system. Times distribution Co fission That's the difference. With heat transfer. And then we still have the. Diffusion coefficient left. Let's have a look how this works out. In some extreme cases for example in the case. That's. The internal resistance is very slow. So that means that the. The outside. Action determines the rates of mass transfer. So the meal number is low. Which means that all resistance is on the outside and. Therefore we do not have a significant. Concentration gradient inside the products. And the whole concentration radian will be on the outside. Well in this case. We can simply say that the amount of moisture. Which is its own Ferd's which is equal to the volume times to concentration of. The moisture in the product of course. This. We can convert it into dishes. By assuming that the volume of the sources it is is constant so we take it out. And we end that with the volume times. The change. Of the concentration in time. That is equal to our normal. Vector of. Muscles for relation. So. Muscle for a coefficient. Times did this distribution go fishing because we have to go verts these calls and tray sions into those which are the equivalent values in the sources. And then we have to multiply it also with the total surface area of the sausage. So that's the basic equation. And we can actually solve this by separating the variables. In this case we say. The concentrations. We take all to the left. And the time dependent variables we take to the right sort of concentrations go to the left the time. Goes to the right. And the other for. Other parameters these ones are all constant. Which means it doesn't really matter whether they're on one or the other side. We can integrate this equation. And if we do that's we ended with a relation which gives the amounts or the or the change of in concentration in the sausage. As a function of time. We can express this. And this form. By saying that's the concentration on a specific moment. Mine is the concentration after a very long time. So if we if we leave the sources for four maybe. Months or maybe a year or so in the same air. Then at some point of course the transfer will stop. So that's the concentration that the sausage will and of then. So this difference. We divide over the initial concentration. Divided by the concentration was more. After a very long time. You can imagine that. At the beginning. Of course the concentration is equal to the initial concentration and therefore this. Parameter will be. One. While after a very long time. The discount inflation will become equal to this concentration. After a very long time and therefore this value will be zero. So it basically goes from one to zero in time. And therefore there's also this. Exponent which gives this fact as a function of time. But also as a function of the milestones for a CO fissions. The distribution call fish and the size of the product. And new. And this new is basically and parameter which indicates the geometry. So for. If we have a slab. Then the new is one. So then than then this devalue is just one. If this would be a cylinder as it is the case with a sausage. Then this value would be two. And if it would be a sphere. Could be a tomato for example or so or some other. Spherical products then it would have a value of three. So it's all it's a constant but it depends on the geometry. While this value goes from one to zero. You can also convert it into what we call deflection transfers. Eat. And that's of course equal to one minus the factor. We can also express this factor. This factor. As being just new. Times. To be OWN number of times to number. Different a number is equal to the diffusion. Coefficients times the time. Divided by the square of the size. And this is a very fundamental but I'm going to. It's in the men's analyzed form of the time. And it's helps in comparing different sized. Products. So B.-O. time for actually equal to this parameter times death for an answer which ones more is equal to a one two times and divided by D.C.. So in that we have completely captured the behavior. If the be zero number is zero so all the reasons on the outside. If you go to the other extreme. That's be that the be a number as is is quite large. Then all the reasons. Is all the insight. So that means that there will be. Little have no concentration of aliens on the outside. But all the concentration gradients is inside. We can also solve this. However the equations are a little bit more complex. They are basically partial differential equations and. Other people have solved these equations and found an relatively easy way of describing this. For short times. This fractions runs Firth's. Base be reduced to a value of. Two times it is new Does this geometry factor times the square roots. Of the free and number divided by pi. So that only for short times. For larger times we need another. Approximation. Which is a little bit similar to what we saw with the below number off of zero. And now we find that the. Fraction transferred is equal to one minus. Some kind of factor. Eight times. Exponents or. Eat to the power minus. Knew another province of times for a number. And for different geometries. We just have values. Of this. A And you. And we that if. Since we know these parameters now we can also simply fill them in and find the amounts of moisture which is transferred after some time. By using the free a number. So that's four. Number which which is. At large in this case it's given as. As to what's infinite but also value of one hundred or two hundred would already be quite tight. In this case. The type of product where you will see it is typical with. Large products. Like for example cheeses which need to be sold out over several days. Or it might be a ham which has to be cured over several months. But typically large projects. And also for a drying. Of products. At a later stage. At the beginning. The. The most a transfer on the outside might be dominating. But later on there most are transports. Inside the product will. Will be rate limiting. And of course then you also have into media situations where to be on embrace. Neither. Very small. Or very large. And then we have to consider both. While this is the most complex problem. But fortunately also. People other people have found approximations for this and we can simply use this rather complex equation to find this out. In fact. Using modern computers it's quite simple quite simple to do to find numbers using this equation. So we can still use them. Even though they're a little bit less accurate than the ones for the extreme cases of below zero and infinite. In some cases. We cannot. Approximates the product by a slab or. A very long cylinder. So then we have to consider. More than one dimension. For example if we would have teachers in the form of big disks. We might approximated by seeing it as a cross section between the slab. And the cylinder. In this case you can prove that you can find the amount of moisture which. Which he has been transferred by simply. Multiplying one over efore one dimension. Times. One ovary for the other dimension. And with that you will find one over the end ones Murray is the total fraction. Transferred of the. Rule system. You can do that for two dimensions. In some cases for example this is a block of cheese. Then you might have to do it for free dimensions with a relation will still be just as fats. So you can use that to look at more complex geometries. Let's see how this works out. This is a question of how how we should dry. Spaghetti. If you make spaghetti. Typically you first make it make a W. but you didn't extrude this does go through very small openings. And the long. Threats that you get. I den. Hung over. Poles which which are then transported through through an air dry air. Where a warm stream of air slowly dries. This begetting. Should not be too fast because then the spaghetti might crack. And should not be too slow. Because then food safety would not be guaranteed anymore. But a good condition is using a temperature of seventy three degrees centigrade. And if you would used heat of air from the environment. Then you would have an amount of moisture of something like. Zero point zero six kilograms per kilogram the diffusion of the moisture in the air. Is two point five six times ten to the minus five. For the spaghetti with Assume that is because he has a typical diameter of one point seven seven millimeters. While we have to reduce the amount of moisture from forty to twelve unhealth percent. At twelve an hour for sense the. Mate which is quite stable. And will not be susceptible to spoilers any more. We can also find from literature that the typical diffusion coefficient of moisture inside such a matrix is something like three times ten to the minus eleven. Please observe that this diffusion Gulf region is a million times lower than the diffusion go fish and. In the air face. Well depending on the driving system we can actually use a cell with relation to find out the must fence for cofee sions which already did for you. So the muscle for coefficients in the air face is ten to the minus four meters for seconds. And then if you simply dry. A space because it's fine for a very long time you will find out the concentration which is at liberty in with the moisture. And with that you can find the distribution Co fissions. Which in this case was zero point six eight. Well with that we can calculate the BE own number. Which is always the first step that you do. So. Muscle for coefficients ten to the minus for distribution call fissions zero point six eight. And a typical dimension. Which is the radius so half times the diameter. Which was one point seven millimeters. Divided by the fusion go fishing and then we find that to be own number is almost two thousand. Well that's a very high value. And it means that. That the resistance from us fans for is completely within the spec at the trends. So that's means that we can actually use the approximation that we found. For shorter and longer times. For a B. O. number that this very large. Well if we do that we find this graph. So for short times. We find a simple approximation with this with the square root of the free a number. Which gives this value. And for longer times we use the other one which is shown by the red line. You can indeed see that at approximately the. Critical freeing them bread which you have to switch over from one approximation to the other you indeed see that. The lines are very close to each other so these are good approximations. Of the amount of moisture. Being transferred. As a function of the free in them for which was a dimension this form of the time. Well if we use this approximation. He is one minus eight times. Exponents to the power. Minus Mutai. Stay free a number. We actually would like to know the time and that's in the for number. We know this one we know how much moisture we want to be transferred. And we know these parameters so we simply have to rearrange these formula. So we bring the two that sides and. They fall into the other sides. And then we take the logarithm to both sides. Then we get rid of the. Each of the e power here. But of course. Also on the other side we have to use a lot of reason. And then if we bring the mute to the other side. We will find the free a number. That's OK. Well. A We have. Mew we have. But we still have to find this fraction that we want to have transferred. Well we know that we had to reduce the amount of moisture from forty percent to twelve and a half percent. For that's what we want to do. And we also know that's why we started with forty percent. But if we wait for a very long time until there's actually Librium. We know that. That's points to the past I will have about ten percent of moisture. Sort of total amount of moisture that we have to transfer is something like a little bit more than ninety percent. Now we have all the parameters we have new we have a. We have eat. And we can find our free a number. Which is zero point three six six. Now things become simple. Before your number is equal to the diffusion coefficient. Times the time divided by the square. Of the radius of the. Of the spoke of these trends and if we fill in the numbers we find that the time. Is a little bit less than two and a half hours. So that means that this begetting has to dry I survive for approximately two and a half hours. Or maybe a little bit less. In air of seventy three degrees centigrade. And this is how you can use these diffusion equation for trenchant transfer. To design process for. Preparing foods. To summarize starting with the diffusion equations and also using the convective equations. We also have to combine that with what's with the relations for multi face milestones for. We could find. How fast friends you must run for it takes place which is quite important. Especially in making solid food products. And we can do that for various dimensions. So and that helps us in the end designing both the products. And also the processes.",

                "text": "This clip is about. Muscles for between faces. So muscles are in move the face systems. Between one face. To another. In many food processes. You typically have exchanged between. Difference. Faces. For example. If. If there would be. Fermentation broth with produces a vitamin for example. Then this vitamin is usually extracted. To to another fluid or it's it might also be that the flavor is generated which is extracted by using a guess. Another example is. The extraction of oil. Using hexane from saving. Or you might also think for example of changing the flavor profile. Of beer in many cases. Or you know in all those cases you will see that. Miles has to be transferred from one face. To another. Basically you will see. During such an extraction process that you will always have two phases. And very often one face will be interspersed into another. For example. In stripping of beer. Then the beer will. Will take the form of droplets suspended. Into air. Or falling through air. In a sparkling drink it will be the reverse. There to drink will be the continuous face while the C O two bubble. Will be. These nice is fierce. In the expection of oil. You often have. Not Not Not Not as much. Droplets but you will have particles. Grounds. Species off. Of. And these will be then interspersed with the action which is the actual liquids also with brewing coffee you have a similar situation of course. Or for example. In just really in the definition of coffee you will have the same situation where the Sullivans is to continuous face. And the coffee. The ground coffee beans. Are in the dispersed face. So let's have a close look at what happens. Need the interface between the two faces. Well basically what we see is that the activity. Of a component which goes from one face to another face will be continuous It will be high in one face. And low in another face. And that will give the driving force for the mouse transfer. At both sides of the interface. We will have a definitive layer. A layer in which. Convection is not possible. Simply because this world overtly says of the convection will not be able to go. Close enough to the interface and therefore at both sides we will have a diffusion of interface. The activity. Is continuous. Also on the interface we will have local extra Libris which means that the activity on one side is equal to the activity. On the other side. However if these are two different liquids or media. Then the activity coffee will not be equal. And therefore by necessity. The Moeller fractions will not be equal. On the interface and will have a discontinuity here. That's because even though the activities are equal. The activity coefficients are not. And therefore the smaller fractions in both phases only interface. Will not be the same. So we will have a jump there. And this jump is given. We can simply take this activity coefficient to the other side. And the ratio of these. Activity coefficients will then. Tell us the difference between the two concentrations on the on the interface. So we can use. The normal way to treat. The diffuser if they are only sites. The same for the other side. But we will have to take into account. This jump in concentration on the interface. So let's have a look how this works out. In practice. Of course we have the diffusion equation for this site. That's this one. And we will have the diffusion equation. For the other side. And that's that one. There are three independent. An anon promises. Present here we have of course we don't know the flux yet. Through the systems. We don't know. The concentration on this side of the interface and we don't know. The concentration on that side of the interface. However we do have a. Thirty question which was this raid show that we find that we found with the help of. This rate show. Of activity. Coefficients. Well if we use this value. We simply say that the rates you of these are different eco frequent is equal to. M. which is the distribution coefficient. If you want sometimes also called the partition coefficient. So now we have three questions. We have three unknowns. Which was the flux. The concentration at one side and the concentration at the other side of the interface. But we also have three questions and therefore we can solve them. But see how this works out. So we take these two equations. And we change them a little bit first of all we take the. Activity. The must transfer coefficient to the other side. And we multiply both sides with the activity coefficient of face a. We do the same thing for the second relation but now. Obviously for Phase be. So once more. Milestone for coefficients and multiplying with the milestones met with the activity Co fission of the other face. Now we add. These two equations to each other so. Now we have here. This this. Molar flux. And we take this CD as he today. Inside the brackets we have a rather complex equation but you'll see that later on. It will become easier. And if we move. If we take these. These two together. We can also see that these two effects have to be the same. Because they are the activities. At both sides of the interface and. And we knew that these were the same. So these two cancel. And we have a relatively simple. Relation here. Well now we take this whole parts. To the other side. To. Year and we ended with a mole a fraction is equal to something. Which is this value. One over this value which we call the overall our overall must transfer coefficient. Times. Every lation which you get which. Which has the concentrations. In both faces. It is so this is a concentration in face be here. And this is the concentration in phase eight. There is also some some other things like for example the. Activity coefficient. In phase be here. But also the total concentration of all components together in face be. So there for see one be divided by C T V effect is equal to the mall a fraction and. If we do that we can actually see that that. That he had the overall must transfer coefficient is equal to one over. This value. Which contains the activity coefficient but also the milestones for coefficients. Well. We started with this relation once more and we can even simplify the little bit further by assuming or. By calling this value. The ratio of the total concentration in phase phase eight times the. Fifty coefficient. In phase be divided by. The total concentration in Phase B. times activity coefficient of phase a the distribution call fish and. While this distribution call fission is very similar to the Henrico fission if one of the faces would be a guess. And if we put this into both equations we find that the molar flux. Is very simple. It is just. Minus one minus the. Must transfer coefficient times to concentration in one face. Minus. The distribution call fissions times the concentration in the other face. And using that over all muscles for CO fission then becomes one over. The muscles for coefficient of. One face. M. divided by the muscles for coefficient of face a plus. One over the miles from for go fishing in face to face be. So this. Completely describes the system. You can also write this in a slightly different form. Where you do not. Converts. The concentration. In face a. But. Do the same for Face be so now. And appear. These two are exactly the same. Mathematically the same as long as you also take into account a slightly different definition of the overall muffins for a goldfish and. So know that here. The M. is with K one two eight. And here it is with K. one to be what you should remember is that when. This distribution call fishing is written with C. one a so if. If you convert Stickles inspiration. Of the of Phase A into that of phase B.. Then you also have to put the M.. With the must on for coefficient in that face similar to here if you put it here with face be. So now you call verticals and trace in Phase B. do that in phase be in phase a. Then you also have to put these with the must win for coefficient of face to be. So if we now want to apply this in practice. Let's have a look how these works with an example. Let us assume that we want to change if we did that we want to strip. A flavor from beer. So now we have beer. Which is represented by the yellow face. And we have air or. Nitrogen as is their face which is here represented by the blue face. That is assume that's the stiff face does not yet have any of these a flavor. While the beer contains about twenty milligrams per liter of this of flavor. Well we can simply find in literature what the diffusion coefficients of this or flavor are in this case or point a time things in the mind for a one face. And zero point eight times tense and mine's nine in the other face. We also can find this year with numbers for example from. Dimensionless. Correlations in this phase it is two hundred and that's phase it's fully point six six. And we assume that. We will have quite a lot of air. Two centimeters. Layer of two centimeters wild to be or will be distributed in the form of droplets of three millimeters. Well now we can use that equation. To find. How fast this all flavor will go from here to there. And we will have to also find this distribution called fish and. Other experiments have shown that. If we have a certain concentration here and we also have a certain pressure or concentration in the guest face. Then at some point we will have likely Librium and Librium as described by the Henrico fissions. In this case it is one point. Twenty five bars for gram per liter. So that's what lays in the unit of Mara times liter. Divided by kilograms. So in this local act Librium. We can actually find the value of the M.. By expressing the constant the pressure that that that we have in the in the air face with the help of these heavy coefficients. And typically. The pressure of two point five plus call. Would be at liberty with twenty milligrams per liter. But we do need to find this. And this distribution coefficient to find how fast the Muslims for it will take place. And the M. is defined with concentrations it's a ratio of concentrations. So we have to knock over this pressure. Into a concentration and we can do that with. The ideal gas law. So the pressure divided by the gas constants. By the temperature is actually equal to one over viz hold amount of moles. Divided by the total volume. And we can even express this. Into a concentration in terms of mass. By multiplying that. With the molecular. Wait of this all flavor. Well if we do that we find a concentration of a gas which would be at a clip. With this beer. And we find from it. That the distribution called fission is equal to two hundred sixty three. Right. That helps a lot. Because we now have this. M.. So we can find the overall diffusion coefficient and if we fail. And if the field is in Macon you get the value. Using also the milestones for CO fishies we found from the sheer would numbers. And this value actually is equal to something like nine point eight times ten to the minus seven. Which is very close to the. Must transfer coefficients. Of just this face. And it shows that. By filling in all these all these parameters you basically finds that the mouse and first completely dominated by this side. The muscles for in in the guest faces so fast. That's actually the muscles for in your face is the only parts. Which is dominant and of course then we can adapt our design for us which is stripping system. Accordingly. This shows how you can use the over almost on for coefficient to find out how fast. Must offer will take place in such a multi component system. So we have seen. That's based on the diffusion log based on the convective. Muscles for relations using a mouse transfer a CO fissions. That we can be rife. A relatively simple equation for. Interface mouse transfer which takes into account. To diffuse of layer splits and they really bring them all into face. And by by doing that you can actually find. How fast this this this. This transfer takes place.",

                "text": "This clip will be about. Milestone for by the fusion. Which is the most elementary form of milestone for and is the basis of. Many foods. Production processes. Diffusion is basically the motion of the random motion of molecules. If you would have a compartment where only red molecules are present in a compartment or only. Whites molecules are present and you would open up these two compartments to each other then you will see just because of the around the motion. That these parts actual. Will start to mix. And the net transport will be dependent on how many red molecules are here and how many whites molecules are there. If you want to see how this actually works and how fast this diffusion goes. We can have a look at how this also works with other types of things hold it. This is not only valid for molecules but also for larger systems. Like for example a ship. You can imagine that if we have a specific this. Difference in velocity between the ship and the sea that you will have to include the driving force because there will be friction so you actually need to motor. To drive. This ship forwards. And the typical friction force between the boat and the sea. Will be proportional to the difference in velocity between the sea and the boats. It will also be dependent on how how strong the interaction is between. The sea and the boat you can imagine that if the. If there's not many passengers. Then the friction force will not be as large while if the boat will be heavily loaded Of course then there will be much more friction and you have to also apply a larger driving force. So that means it's not just the difference in velocity. But it's also about the amount of the environments. In this case. Expressed as the most. FRACTION OF. Other components present in this case to see. Well this is the basic equation. Of friction between a specific most moving. Component and its environment. So this is still a proportionality and we call the proportionality. Cofee the. Proportionally. Proportion of the constants. The friction called fissions. Which is usually expressed with the Zeta. This is not so different from for example then. When you would be on the very crowded square. You can imagine that if you have a strong driving force to go through the McDonald's on the other side of the of. The square but there's a lot of people. You'll have a lot of friction with people. And you will need a strong driving force to get through. If this court is very empty. So there are not many people then you can just go ahead and there will not be a lot of friction. So you'll have the same type of behavior. Another example is if you would have a very full coverage. At home. So your clothes are really stuck together. And if you want to get out one particular T. shirt. It will be. You will you will feel the friction too it's while if it's quite empty you can just get it out without a lot of driving force. So in that sense it's quite a general relation. If we translate this to. Molecules it behaves in exactly the same way. So if we have one molecule. That has to move through a lot of other molecules there will be a lot of friction. For sure. So there for them the mole fraction of the orange molecules will be high and that means that also the friction is high. However if we have a lot of moving molecules. Blue molecules. And there will only be a few molecules with which you know to move. Then the typical friction that one molecule feels. In its motion. Will actually read the report the low. Because the concentration the action of these orange molecules is. Is low. And therefore also the friction will be low. So we can completely translate this to molecules. And this friction force has to be counteracted has to be compensate. By driving force and. One form of driving force is simply the concentration if we have a lot of blue molecules here there will be a driving force for this molecule. To move from here to there. It's not just a concentration it's also about. Affinity. You can imagine that. If these molecules would stick to this place. Then they would not easily go in that direction. So if this environment really retains these molecules. Then the driving force. Will be very large and you have to take that into account. And we generally do this with the chemical potential the chemical potential is equal to a constant. Which is dependent on pressure and temperature and other things. Times. I guess can sometimes the temperature and times the rhythm of the activity. In this case the activity. Of such a blue molecule. And the driving force. Is the gradient of this chemical potential. So the gradient basically is this the. D.M.U.. The set and. Since. Typically we have a gradient. Downhill. So molecules will move in this direction. And the gradients will be downhill. This value will be negative and seems to. Since the force is positive we also need to include a minus. The units. Of a chemical potential is Jewel from zero. And if you didn't look at the units. Of the gradient of the chemical potential. And you. You take to promote. Per meter. You actually find out it's Newton promote So it's really a force for a mole. Of molecules. So what we do is we have a driving force. We had this friction force already. And if this molecule. While it was moved at this at a certain rate. These forces have to just compensate each other so he just he just equates them to each other and then we can find the typical. Philosophy of motion. So let's see how these work. This is the driving force. The. Radiance of the chemical potential. And since this was a constant. Of course a concept is called something there for the derivative of a constant will be zero. So we are left with these parts are tee times and in a while we just assume now that the temperature will be constants. So minus our T.. Times. Degrade eons. Of the logarithm of the activity in the location so that's our driving force. We ready has the friction force. So we can just equate them. And them. We can find what the value is of. The relative velocity of the of the diffusing components. So now we take these parts. These friction coefficients times the mole fraction. And we simply bring that to the other side. And we enter with this relation. And that gives the difference in velocity the relative velocity of the. Diffusing molecule. Is equal to minus R. T.. Times the. Divided by the fiction call fish and times one over X. two. Which was the most fraction of the environments. Times are driving force. While this value R T V five and by Zeta. Is also called. The diffusion coefficient. So basically we end up with this relation. Difference in velocity. Is equal to the one to divide it by. The most fraction of the environment. Times the driving force. And. Well if we just have one component which diffusers and environments. Of course Dymo fraction of the environment equal to one minus. The Mole fraction of the fusion of the diffuse of components. So this is a general form of. The relation. However usually we may say that the environment stand still. Usually approaches just stand still and therefore we can say that to develop city. Will be zero. And we just move to the absolute velocity of the diffusion components. This relation is fine. But it just gives us the developes of the of the molecules in meters per second. Usually we're not that interested in it. But we typically want to know how much. Will these all for how much will evaporate. And then we have to convert this into either. A mole flux. Which has a unit. Of moles. Burst career meter per second. Or mouse flicks which will be in kilograms. For me to spur seconds. When he would use have to multiply this equation. By the concentration of this component. Because well a Flex is equal to have a lot of the times the amount of molecules. Diffusing of course if there are more more molecules diffusing with the same right. There will also be more. More total miles being transported. So this follows the times to total concentration in in miles per cubic meter times dim. Mo fraction of the specific component will give us the model flux. And then we get this relation. If we do not take the mole. Molar concentration but the way to concentration to Moscow is in tracing. We entered with the mouse flux. So this is our. General diffusion. Equation. In this case for the motor flex. This is generally valid. But still is rather complex so we would like to a simplified a little bit further. For practical purposes. So let's have a look at what we can do. First of all. Let's see what's. What happens if we say that the system is diluted. So we just have only a few molecules diffusing. In a matrix which stand still in that case. The Mole fraction of diffusion Capone's. Is is low. There from one minus. Actually one will be more or less one. So we can simplify it. This one this part will go away. And already the equation becomes simpler. But we can make it more simple. By assuming that's or. Taking into account that the activity is equal to the. Activity coefficient. That's filled in. So he had a is. Substituted by the activity coefficient times the mall affection. And now we also assume that the activity Co for hints. Is constant. So it's does not depend on the concentration which is not always the case but in some cases it's true. If we say that we can actually. Simplify this by using the fact that the derivative of something. Of the logarithm of. Something as a function of another parameter is equal to one over. I times D. I did it so that's what we do here. This. L.N. Gumma. Times X.. Is converted into D X. Times one over Gama X.. If we do that and. Well we still assume that gonna was constant. You see that. That these two were cancelled because did. This discussion. Can be out of the of the gradient so these two cancel. And we end the with a relatively simple equation. Because we can also take this concentration. Into the gradient and we end up with a simple equation. Which is the most flux. Is equal to minus the diffusion coefficient times the gradient in concentration. But mind you it is only valid. As long as the solution is dilute. And as long as this activity coefficient will be constant. However this equation. It's very suited because it's simple. The diffusion coefficient plays a key role. It kept used to behavior of the material. And its And the easiness off the fusion through a specific material. If we look at gases for example what are favor through air we depict Lisi very fast a fusion diffusion go fishing has a value of. Around ten to the minus five. Maybe even then to the minus four in some cases. In liquids. Like for example the solution of sugar or coffee or. Or. Ethanol and Walter. We typically see a diffusion coefficients of ten to the minus nine. Which is ten thousand times smaller than in the gas. So it really means that the fusion in liquid is much slower than any guess. If we go to so let's like for example. Fish or butter or fish meal. These types of. Of silence. We see the diffusion go fishing to us in the range of ten to the minus nine to ten to the minus fifteen. And that's another one thousand times smaller. So therefore the diffusion is all it is very slow in liquids it is still very slow. While in gases it's pretty quick. This is also shown here. For example in the right figure. You see the the. Diffusion coefficient in the number of different foods materials. As a function of the amount of moisture which is present in these materials. If these materials. Are quite moist you seeded to diffusion coefficients will be in the range of ten to the mine is nine ten to minus ten. However if you take all of the moisture. There you see does this. Diffusion coefficients. Drops. Very quickly to values of ten to the minus fourteen ten to the minus fifteen. Which is something like a million times smaller than there. So it's really dependent on the amount of moisture. And that basically also represents what happens if you for example dry your product if you start here in the state diagram. And then take out moisture you will go in this direction but you see that at some point you go into the glass region and in glasses the diffusion coefficients are almost zero. Sometimes you can make use of that. For example this product which is sold by feast on company is a mixture of proteins and polysaccharides. Which which was made in the solution so somewhere here in the state diagram. And while it was a solution they put a lot of nitrogen pressure on it something like two hundred bars. The nitrogen dissolved in the Matrix. And then they basically. This all feels that they took out of the water by by buy it by evaporating the water and then cooling it down into the glassy region where there's diffusion cofre he was exceedingly small. Well. At that point. The Matrix. Is So let's end the night in the still capture. Captured and it and you will see that these nitrogen will just stay there for several years in fact and you can sell the product. Well this product then. Is very stable you can buy it in the supermarket and if you put it in your coffee. The nitrogen which is still kept in this matrix will come free and you will have an instantaneous formation of a foam. For example for it for a cup which you know that works very well and make use of the. Very low value of the diffusion coefficient of in this case nitrogen. In a glossy matrix. Another example of. The fact that the Fusion is slow. Is in cooking pasta. You know that you have to take something like. Between five to ten minutes to cook it and the reason is that the diffusion of the water. Into the pasta is quite slow. You start with very small it's a glossy bust up. And then in time. The water has to diffuse. Into this glass which is very slow. To slowly Janata nice. And also. Dilutes the starch a little bit. Until after something like fourteen to sixty minutes. The whole matrix has become small I'm with water. Well this would be something like this this would be very soft. But it showed that it takes a long time before. This type of material will will have diffused into into into the pasta. So these are some examples of how to use this diffusion equation. That we derived. In this clip. Let's just assume that's. We're interested in the design of a package. For fish. And our package is something like ten centimeters by twenty centimeters by freight. Centimeters. And we. I would like to come to consider the use of high density polyethylene. As a material for the package. We also know that the fish inside. Can only have something like one milli model. Of oxygen. Before it becomes rancid and the. Very suitable to eat and more. So now we have a lot of information we know that. Inside the product. The oxygen. Should not be there basically and if it's dairy probably react with the limits. While in our environments in the normal. Air. We have something like twenty one percent of oxygen. And we can use literature to find that the typical concentration of oxygen. That would be at Achree Librium with this value. In high density polyethylene. Is something like. Zero point zero two more per cubic meter. Another question is how think. There's this layer. Need to be. To protect this product. Sufficiently long. To have a shelf life of two weeks. Well let's have a look at how this works we can we can use our diffusion equation. And we can approximate. The gradient over the spike edging material. By taking the difference in concentration. Inside and outside. The vide by the thinking of this layer. So this is a concentration inside is a concentration outside. And since we assume that this concentration. Is zero. We do not need to use this value because it's zero. And we end up with this relation. For the most flux. Of oxygen into the package. Well this is just the flux so it's. Moles per square meter per second so we have to multiply it with the surface area. To find out the total amount of oxygen. Which gets into the product. And that should be equal to the maximum amount that we can have in the product if I did it by the typical shelf life that we want to have. So we can fill in our flex. So we do this here. And then. Well we know. This time because it was it was two weeks it's our shelf life we know there's value because we found that out. In other. Experiments. And therefore we can simply find devalue. Of. The think this. Of packaging material that we once. By rearranging the equation. And we get this relation. Then we simply fill it fill in the numbers. For the diffusion coefficients. For the concentration on the outside here. For the surface area of the package. And also for the shelf life this is two weeks. In seconds. The five to buy the maximum amounts. That's that we can transfer. And then we enter with a typical thickness of this package of. Around half a meter. And that shows how you can use. The diffusion equation. To design such a package. To summarize. We have cover it's the diffusion. Friends for it's relevant for for for food products. We have a general form. Which which can be either in mole. In moles or. Kilograms. And we have a simplified version which is only valid for. You know for locals information dilute systems. And systems where the. Activity coefficient is constant. We can use either one. And they they they form the fundament for the fuse or transfer its influence.",

                "text": "This leave will be about the contribution of confection. To mouse transfer. While the fundamental. Form of muscles for is by the fusion. Very often we have to improve. The rate of. Muscles for. By using convection. Because diffusion is usually very slow. For example if you make a cup of tea. You might want to as a little bit of sugar and. If you add this you could then you actually want to stir and that's because that will speed up the mouse transfer from super crystals into the into the teeth. It is the same in industry if for example if you would like to draw a specific product in this case. Strawberries. Also there. You wants to introduce a flow of air. To accelerate the rate of evaporation. Also a larger scale for example here in the production of. Dr sausage is also there you have to supply a continuous flow of air. Of dry air. To dry these also to use. And if you're at home. You might want to make a nice bread in an often and also there the oven actually will have a lot of convection. To take away the moisture and to speed up the diffusion from the Bretts. So it's quite from the mental. For a number of activities. Well what you're doing is they. That's by steering. You as a lot of convection a lot of. At least as. Swirls in the liquids. And these swirls. Will even out. The concentration difference in the bilge at the very fast rate. So that means that effectively. Any difference and in the in concentration will be taken away and the concentration will be the same everywhere in the bulk of the liquids. However in the air interface of. For example a crystal bit of. Any other type of product could also be the wall for example of a fan. Near such an interface. You will always see a layer where there staring is simply not possible. This liquid is so close to the surface that it's not possible to stir close enough to the surface and therefore. The others will die out in the direction of the surface. And that means that there will always be a layer here. Where the fusion. Will be dominant and. Well. We can use this simple diffusion law. To describe the diffusion in this layer which was the flux. Amounts of material which is transferred as a front. Divided by the surface area and. Time is equal to the diffusion coefficient. Minus the diffusion coefficient times degrading and. In the concentration over this specific layer. Well they can approximate. This value. By taking the difference in concentration between the surface and. The concentration in the fluid bulk divided by the thickness of this layer. Well we do not know the thickness of this layer because that will strongly depend for example on the amount of stirring that we do. So we don't know the value and we have to see how we can find a value for this. Well we started with this. We approximate. The gradients with the difference in concentration divided by to take this of the layer and. We simply take this value. And put it towards the diffusion go fishing so don't we put its below it. And well we do not know it is value yet. But would simply call this the mouse transfer coefficients. And this and this. While the convective must transfer coefficients. And if we now can find a value for this value. And we also know the difference in concentration. Over this layer we can actually find how fast the sugar for example will dissolve from a crystal is the pickle dimension of this milestone for a coefficient is in meters per second. Basically if we want to find a value. For it this must transfer a coefficient we have to realize it is dependent on the number of things. First of all is dependent on properties of the fluid. For example if the fusion. And. Of the component of this transfer it is very low in this liquid. Then also the milestones for will be low. Similarly if the. If the viscosity of this liquid is very high. You have to do a lot of stirring. If you want to reduce this. Thickness of this layer and therefore also the physical city is important. We need to know these values. But it's not just the properties of the liquid it's also about what we do with it so it's also dependent on the process if we start a lot. And certainly this layer will be thinner. And if we don't serve a lot of course it will be thicker. So it is both dependent on the properties of the fluids and. What we do. In the process. And we can capture these behavior with the help of the mines in those numbers. You might be aware of the right notes number which is a way to correct. The type of flow. That we apply in the system. It is basically a ratio of the convective forces that we introduce by steering and the viscous forces viscosity and of course the more visited it is the harder we need to stir. To create an a flow. So that's the right. Number. It's equal to the density times to typical for those of the rate of the liquids that we introduce times to the dimension of. Of the object. Like for example the sugar crystal. The vide by the viscosity of the fluid. But we also need to correct Rice. The properties of the material. And we do that with MUST runs for with the help of the Schmidt number. Which is the ratio between impulse transfers. To transfer of motion in the liquid and. The fuse of friends for the really diffuse of mass transfer from the crystal towards the solution. And this number is equal to deface causes he defied by the density times the diffusion coefficient. It is exactly the same type of number. As the probable number. Was he transferred. Also there we saw that's the puddle number is equal to the impulse transfer and if I did in that case. With the heat conduction. Equal to difficulty time. Heat capacity. Divided by the heat conduction it's the same number but now from Austin three. And then if you want to find the milestones for coefficients we can simply use these two numbers to correct the system. And then we will find the milestones for coefficient with the help of the show would number. Sure what number. Is the ratio between. The convective transfer and the diffusion of transfer. If it's just only. The fusion then of course there will be no convective transfer and this value will be one if there is a lot of convection if we store a lot for example then there's value will be much larger. And this. Sure would number is equal to the mouse transfer Co fissions. Times does this decide of the object. The vide by the diffusion coefficient. And what we depict Lisi. Is that you can find the value of the issue which. Member. As a function of the wrangles and the sweep number partly as a power relation. Where A is a constant. Depending on the geometry. And and is usually something between one and a half and zero point eight. While M. eight usually zero point three three. It is once more. Exactly the same as with heat transfer. There we had the nuzzled number which was the ratio between convective transfer and conductive heat transfer. And we could also find these relations in the same way. These relations are dependent on the geometry. But what you see for example in a fully developed laminar flow into that the Surewood number and then the whole number. In fact are exactly equal. Also for example in the in a fully developed. Turbulent flow in the slit. There you will us. Also find more or less the same relation. However with the Knesset member we have an extra term here. Which usually is actually very close to one. So in practice these relations are almost the same. And for other types of geometries and system he will see very similar type of correlations. Well how to use these types of mouse fronts for. Relations. Let's have a look at an example. And maybe a very simple one. Looking at the dissolution of sugar in a cup of coffee. There's assume that we have two crystals. Which are. One millimeter large. And we don't store a lot so we just gently so that there are this burst. But if we keep our steering limited. The wrangles number will still be very low. And therefore this year would number in this case. From this correlation is just too. Because this will be zero. And there for the short relation will be. The Sherwood number will be just to. Well then it's simple. To find the must transfer coefficients. Your members of the show with numbers equal to the milestones for coefficients times the size of the crystal divide it's by the. Diffusion coefficient. But if you leave. That we find that the milestones for a covert agent is equal to two times the diffusion coefficient. Divided by diameter of the crystal. And if you prefer to use the radius. Of course as equal to diffusion coefficients divided by the radius. Well now we have the must feel for go fishing but we still need to find values. For the concentrations. Both in the bulk of the sugar. And also on the interface very close to the Crystal. Well this one. We can find by assuming that. At the beginning there is not yet much sugar. In the coffee and therefore the concentration to bilk. Is close to zero. So let's just assume it's zero. The other concentration is more difficult because we have a crystal. And we have this diffuse of lay around it. And now these concentration here at the interface is basically the concentration which is just outside the crystal. But still in the fluids. And that means. It's not the concentration of the sugar in the crystal but it's to concentration which is at. I could Librium at local if we leave him with a sugar crystal. Well actually we can find these values with the help. Of state diagrams. You might remember that the state diagram gives to concentration as a function of the and and the coal and temperature and. A super Crystal is represented by. This line. Which is just one hundred percent. Sucrose. The bulk of the liquid had no show sucrose and therefore it is represented by this point. The concentration which is a liberty in with the crystals. Is the maximum concentration to some sole ability of the sugar. In the coffee. Which is represented by this point. So this is the. This is the composition of the super concentration at the interface. In the fluids. And for sugar in coffee actually it's a lot of value because it's well so level. It is Ron's two Peter grams per liter. Well now we have everything. We have that must transfer go fish and. We have the concentration in the bill. And we have the concentration at this interface. This is the flex. Which is the amounts of sugar which does all spur square meter per second. And therefore if we multiply it with the total surface area of the crystal. We find the total. Reduction in miles of the crystal in time. Well you might remember that. The mouse of a crystal. Is equal to the density times. Its value. And if we assume that the chrysalis. Spherical. Of course we can express. The volume by. Fourth or its by two to the times. The radius to the third power. If you don't take the derivative you end up with this relation. So Deb describes the reduction of the radius of the crystal. And this was equal to the surface area. Times. The flux the mass flux. Which we found earlier. So if we take this value we put it here. Then this should be equal to the surface area of the crystal times. The mouse flux. We can simply fill this in. If it's a spherical Crystal. The surface area is used for by our square at will read in has a value for the must friends for a coefficient. So we simply fill it in. And then at the end. If you simplify this a little bit you find a relation which is actually relatively simple. Which gives the decrease in the radius of the crystal as a function of the concentration of the interface the solubility. The diffusion coefficient and. The density. Well. We can now integrate this differential equation. And at the ends you then get a relation of the radius of the crystal as a function of time. Of course if the time is zero. Then we will start with the concentration at the beginning the initial concentration. And then slowly. This crystal will become smaller and there for the radius will become smaller. So if we rearrange this equation for the time that the radius will be zero. So that the time of complete dissolution. You end up with this relation. And if we don't feel that. Phil Phil Phil in the numbers that we have. We find that the difficulty solution time is two point three minutes. Which is pretty long. But that's because we didn't stir. If you would stare more than the Surewood number would be larger and there for this time. Would really become smaller as well. So this is the way. You can actually use these types of equations. The future behavior is governed by the law of the fusion either the general form or for a bar for a for more diluted systems. The simplified form. While the contribution of call. Of convection is described by. The flux being equal to the milestones for coefficient times. The difference in concentration. And the milestones for coefficient can be found with the help of the mention of this. Correlations.",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this second flick clip on the linear model in which we will discuss parallel lives let me show you a map where we are. So we've. I think produced a linear model to you and now we over here we will see. Other examples of Lee models later on. But now we will focus on a parallel line situation. Let's look at the example of soil Ph. So remember depended furball Why was the PH of the soil. After the ministration of lime there were two types of lime with a type of lime agricultural lime and the Westby type of lime granular line. The coffee area at the corner that every dresser is the amount of lime with value zero one. Until eight. And here you see a little cut apart. The relationship between X. and Y. with different colors for the two types of lines. But we need to do now is. We need to formulate the regression model using the fetter af. And a quantitative aggressor X.. I recall the fact the levels are represented by dummies. This case. The Factor has only two level so we need a single dummy. Coding for. For instance one type B. so we create a dummy D.B. and here you see it. It has value equal to one if we have an observation from the BE group zero otherwise. Choosing this dummy D.B. makes ADA Reference Group. Because the dummy is zero. For that type of line and next we just fits a multiple regression model. Why is because hero beat. Zero B. times the dummy post beat a one times X. plus an error. And it used to parallel or parallel lines for question. Let's check out the two different lines in the two different groups if we would have an observation from the reference group. A where the dummy is equal to zero then this part B. does there will be times Levy will fall out. And we are left with B. to zero plus B. to one times. X. a system at. Part of the model if we have an observation from the big group. With a dummy. Is equal to one. We pick up. This because here a B.. Coefficient. Which has to be added to the B. to zero. And as you it's because your a plus B. to zero be a C. intercept. And we have the same slope. You don't want. So we have a common slope situation here. Here is a graphical representation of the situation. We see that there are two intercepts. B. to zero for the. Type. A group. In red here and we have B. to zero plus Peters' here a B. in the in the. Tybee group. And we have a common slope. B. Tell one. The real the coefficient B. to zero B. actually measures to difference an intercept between the types of B. and Reference Group. In this case is negative because line type B. results in lower ph values. OK how this is working in our well. We start with creating a dummy variable. Next we fit. The multiple linear regression model. And we ask for the repression coefficients. And here. Be that here a B.. Is estimated to be minus point two zero five. Meaning that on after it. After administration of one time. Be. The PH is point to lower compared to the reference group A. At any dose. The slope would be to one had is. Point zero five nine. So for every extra unit of line ph. Increases with point zero five. Well of course there is no need to do this by hand you don't need to define these damage yourself can easily do it for you. The only thing that you have to make sure is that this indeed is a factor here it is checked and indeed it is a factor. If you just put a factor into the linear model and our will make a dummy for you. And the results will be identical. If we write down the fitted model equal a shift for the two diff. Types of lime. I just fill in those requestion co-efficients and then the regression equation for the. Reference Group will be five point six two intercept. Plus B. to one times X.. And in the line type B. group where the demi is equal to one we pick up this beat as your a B.. So we pick up this extra minus point two or five. You have to at least to get a. And it yields the interception five point six five seven. In the group. If we want to write down such in parallel lines. Model that can be done in two ways we can use repression notation when you explicitly see the dummies. Because Iraq was because there would be times D. be close. Because or see that. You see if there would be more than two levels. Plus B. to one times the Xplosion ever. But maybe it's more efficient to use and I know for style notation where you should see the effects of a defector and. You were invited are like this be the zero per stall I. Place because one times the X.. D. index. I index for the levels of to factor in next J go through their pockets within each level. Remember that. If you write down the model like this it's all for parametrized. And there is one parameter must be removed in some way. And I will do it by making tall one. Equal to zero. So the first group becomes the reference group. Making be to zero the intercept in the reference group. And the store I parameters to the deceptive consists of reply with a reference group. So the those. Tall I parameters are actually equal to the B. to C. or obese. Parameters in the requestion addition. So we have two ways of writing the same. Parallel lines. OK let's go to a second example the example about birth weights and smoking of Tamara. So remember the dip in the furball. Why. The birth weight of the baby. Represents the smoking status. With two levels. Numerically coded. Ciro stands for a nonsmoking mother one stands for smoking mother and the other of regrets her ex is the juror ation of the pregnancy. Which. It's shown over here. We have to paralyze model as before and. We can use the demi D one well. My editor's here is the last column but actually you see it's just the same as S. itself so we could just use as well. If we use this. Dummy for both the one. You see that it is zero. In the nonsmoking group so that becomes the reference group. Here is a graphical representation. And you can write down the models for nonsmoking. Moderates. Because you're up as Peter one times the X.. And for the smoking monitor. We have an interceptor this year uplift because here all one has to be the one time tax. The fitted model. Would look like this here is the. Our output. We note that the regression coefficient for the dummy is able to minus point two six nine. Meaning that babies from spoke a modest or an effort. Point twenty seven kilograms lighter. Keeping the pregnancy duration constant. And you see the two parallel lines here in the situation. Also notice. The to one parameter alpha here point zero twelve. So for every extra day of pregnancy duration. Babies are twelve grams. If you split the nonsmoking modest here is three question equation. Point one one seven plus. Point zero one two times X.. And for smoking modest. The question is minus zero point one five two plus point zero twelve times X.. If we look in the model that we just. Studied this because here a parameter had no practical interpretation. Because he would represent the mean birth weight in nonsmoking in the nonsmoking group. If the pregnancy duration would be zero days which of course is impossible. So to give it an interpretation we could centered. Wanted to regress. We could suppress the efforts. In this case. Subtract two hundred eighty point one. Days from each value of X.. And we use this newly defined as the confetti it. We just put in Z.. In the in the into regression model replacing the X.. And if we do this we will see that B. to zero one and beat or Y. will not change. But. We will have a new intercept. Gum a zero which it actually is the mean birth weight in the reference group. If Z. is equal to zero. Meaning at the. Efforts fail you have to do your duration. So if we have a baby with a pregnancy duration of two hundred eighty point one days. Here you see the regression coefficients of change in this way. Notice three point four nine five we can see it actually in the graph. We have to go to the X. axis at two hundred eighty point one which is the effort shall you go up to the reference group. You go left to do Y. axis and here you're going to read off the intercept. From this model. Which is three point four nine five kilograms. In summary a parallel lines model. Is a linear model. With a systematic part containing. Well. At least one factor. And at least one quantitative regress or without interaction factor levels usually are coded by dummy fables. We can write such a model and two ways either we use an over style. Which is more compact. Or we can use the repression style where you have to write down all the individual dummies. Typically in our to dummy for the first level of the factor. Is excluded. Like in the first. Level the reference group. And making parameter be this hero to intercept in this reference group. The perimeter stall are the differences in intercept between group I. And this reference and neither one is the common slope. And centering the quantitative aggressor is useful to get into purge of all. Intercept values. So. Meaning the mean in the reference group at the efforts failure of the request for your attention as you in the next clip.",

                "text": "This clip. Is about. One of the. Aging related diseases namely osteoporosis. It addresses. Three areas. Its prevalence. Its definition. And its consequences. One of the most often used. Definitions of osteoporosis. Is that. Of The World Health Organization. This organization defines osteoporosis as a systemic. Skin lethal disease. That is correct arise. By a loss of bone mass. And by a deterioration. A loss of bone structure. This is nicely. It is traded on these two pictures. One picture. Of normal. Dense. Bone and. One picture. Of osteoporotic ball on fire less dense. This brittle bone. Is much more. And the film or a ball. To fracture into success the bill says kept ability. Is clearly increased. And fractures. Occur. Predominantly. At three sites that deferred to bray. Their hip. And at the wrist. Because of its high prevalence. Osteoporosis is considered a public health concern. In the Netherlands. About eight hundred thousand people have the disease. Worldwide. This number. Amounts to two hundred million. With a preponderance. In power. Asked. May Nepal's a women. Because of hormonal changes. Around the main airports. Own currently. There's an increased fracture. Incidence. Worldwide. The number. Amounts to nine million fractures per year. This is actually the number for the year two thousand. But with the aging of the population. It isn't visits that. This number will have doubled. By the year twenty fifty. And this is not only. Involving women. It's true that one out of three women. Over the age of fifty. Will experience an osteoporotic fracture. But it also affects men. At least one. Out of five of them. After the age of fifty. The consequences of osteoporosis. Are truly divans the of osteoporosis. Fractious analysts say depend on their location. First of all fractious. Often go and. Notice. You just don't. I'm a see them. They go with a lot of pain they cause. Loss of hides. And in the weight. In the end of bending off of the back so-called foes is. More visible. I think fact they're paying for a set as well and they lead to disability. Dependence. In the end. And they require surgery. Such hip fractures. Are No. Four Go along with an increased mortality risk and. Especially in the first three months. After a fracture. The risk is increased. We see increased with. Five fold in women. Eight fold. In men so on average about. It sticks. In the first three months that this. Risk persists. At least for a period of ten years. Our super oses literally means. The poorest bone. It's like an end stage. Condition. Mostly. Presenting itself. Later in life. But bone. Is living tissue. It's developing in the first phase of life. After birth. It's developing and strengthening. To reach. Peak bone mass around the age of thirty. Later on. There's a gradual loss of bone mass. And bone mineral density. To reach levels. That will be diagnosed of maybe diagnosed as. Osteoporotic levels. For this diagnosis. W H O S proposed the T score. This score. Takes the bone mineral density of. Adult young populations as the reference. And once the bone mineral density. Is below two times. The standard deviation. Below. This average. Of the reference population. On speaks about osteoporosis. Not for diagnosis but for screening are for the prediction of risk. There's a reasonably. Developed tool. The fracs thaw. It may include. Bone mineral density. But not necessarily that's a mess so. It includes vist factors. For osteoporosis like. Age gender and. Clinical risk factors. It's currently being used as a first step in diagnosis. And for developing meaningful. Preventative. That's a tease. This clip. Has informed you. About osteoporosis. What is what it is about its providence. Its consequences. And its diagnoses.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip. Is about faces. And states. In food. Food is either a genius system. It consists of homogeneous parts which are called faces. And a face is a region. But uniform chemical and physical properties. And the faces are separated by this thing which will boundary. The states of matter. Is a form in which different faces. Can exist. An example is ice cream. Ice cream. Has a lot of water with dissolves sugars in it. But also fed club eels and. Ice crystals. Milk proteins. Air bubbles. So all these face different faces can except. Exist together. The state of a face. Depends on the temperature. And the pressure. And this is the. This can change upon changes in temperature and pressure. And case of a soul it. By increasing the temperature. It will melt. To a liquid. Or if it can go further it will evaporate. To a gas. And case of increasing temperature. To enter into molecular forces will be lower and. The system will take more folio. In case of increasing the pressure. The system wants to go to a situation where it takes a lower volume. And where all the particles are closer together. So. Going from a gas to a liquid is called common station. Or further back to a solid is called freezing. An example is boiling water. Here we have again. To homogeneous. BARTSCH the Faber. And the boiling water and the faces are separated by a boundary. In between. Within one phase. The chemical and physical properties. Are uniform. When. Never. Phase one is going to face to be talk about. Face transition. Another example is an emotion. Of oil and water. It can be a water an oil emotion or. An oil in water emulsion. And again here. We have two homogeneous faces. Water in oil. But these two. Cannot be mixed. They are immiscible. Faces. We have one component. For face and the. Two Faces are separate. By this effect and. Boundary Layer. In this case. Both phases are in the liquid state. And a face can have or can have more than one component. For instance in the water face Hugo's can be dissolved as well. And. And all face. Certain also able FITZSIMMONS. Can be solved. This passions are mixers of mixtures or faces. In this case. We always have a continuous face. This site and this poor face. And a dispersed face is the smaller particles which are present in the continuous face an example is a solid in liquids this portion. Here we have saw the particles in a liquid. Continuous face. For instance. Saturated sugar solution. It has crystals. Of sugar in a liquid. Another example is a gas. In liquids. If gas. This solves this in liquids. At the higher pressure. And really raised the pressure. The girls will be released and it will form a foam. The Gus face of God's will follow. The ideal gas. Equation. In case. We increase the temperature. It also indicates that. I did a pressure. Order fall you will be increased. This is a plight. And a case of an air balloon. The air is heated. And the volume. Will become larger. So the density of the gas face will become lower. Another example is. Bringing in more gas molecules so increasing the number of moles Vodafone. And the pressure in the balloon. Will increase and the system hit the gas bottles. The volume cannot increase. But the pressure. In these gas bottles. Is quite high. We don't. We often have a mixture of gases. Frizzes dry air. Is a mixture of gases. And most your. Air can also include more sure. So favor. Upon drying products or boiling water be also create a mixture of gas and a system that will. Flavors. The flavors are quite volatile and they melt but we can smell them. In the air. Again this example of this self in liquids. It is this self and liquids on the pressure. Once the pressure is released. Gus bubbles will be formed and it will give a foamy product like to be a cream or beer or Francis Cup But you know. Then you go to the liquids liquids. We know to mess. Water all solutions are dispersions. But in fact. Also products. With a higher. Fish custody belong to the group. Of liquids. So that there is a wide range. In fiscal city. For liquids. Whenever we have. Products with a higher Fiske us T.. We still talk about liquids. In some cases they're listing. Properties of the of the of these tales. They're called jails. Will be larger than the flu it is for a ditty. Examples are cheese. Lakers or Brett. Going higher in viscosity. There will be extremely slow. Flow and. We will perceive the product. As a as a solid but solid properties. Examples are. The crust of a pizza or cookies. These products are quite crispy. When they are in the classy. State. How can we come to this glass state. Starting from a liquid. It's in this order structure. We can come to a classy. State. So to a classy well classy liquid infect by furry. But by applying a very fast. Cooling. Or drying. And this if you ation. The structure is sort of. Immobilized. And that this sort of structure that we had in the liquid. Is still present in the in the glass situation. Whenever we apply at a slower. Cooling or a slower drying the sugars in this case. Talk about your course. They have time to go in their preferred state. In a crystalline state. So we get. Sugar crystallization. And we will end with a suspension of sugar crystals. The class state is very disorders. Whereas the. Crystalline state. It is a very. Ordered. Structure. And a crystalline state because of this very order to structure the. The packing is for a dense. This is the case for certain sugar certain Sultan certain fats. An example is electros electros likes to come to the to the crystalline state. And it can be without water or. With water. This brings me to the conclusions of faces and states. Food is each Regina system. With homogeneous faces. And the state of these faces. I did a liquid. Solid or gas. Depends on the temperature. The pressure. And the composition.",

                "text": "I there. Welcome back to this session about logistic regression. But actually going to deal with the last clip. I'll show you on the map where we are. We're here. In a previous clip we talked about destination. And now. We're covering testing. Both clips. Are rather hard going. But. I want to give you some impression. About how it works. Now we're going to talk about two general test procedures the world test. Due to Abraham Walt. And the like to address your test you to even Pearson and Jersey nine men. And from the wall test. Will only use had a special case. We'll look at a set test. That is to wall test for a single parameter of the set test it will sound familiar to you I guess. Like to try to test can be used for a single parameter as well. But also for. Now hypothesis involving several parameters. Now here. You have the outputs. That you have seen in previous clips. For the example. With the seven groups of last night that were exposed to different concentrations of insecticide and. Actually from the output. You can take. Directly. Does that scores. Is that values and. P. values connected to them. Let's say that we're interested in a knowledgeable to say is that B. to one is equal to zero. It's an important typo to say yes because if we can't reject this hypothesis we cannot show that the probability to kill a larva. Is actually connected to the concentration X.. It is exposed to set the test the case think is the estimate for BT I wonder slope. Minus the value from an all or part this is usually zero. Divided by the standard error. And it follows from the theory that. Under the knowledge poultices. It will approximately follow. A standard normal distribution. This. And I will see us. To calculate a two sided prevail you. It's actually over here. It's extremely small. Indicating that indeed. We reject the null hypothesis. Of the slope being equal to zero. We have shown that it is a relationship between the probability. To kill an insect and. The construction. It was exposed to so that values are easy to find in the output. For the like a Dr who test will extend the problem a little to make it more interesting. The first part over here. Is the original data set. Now for pesticide A and we add another seven groups. Now. For another pesticide big pesticide or insecticide. And we're interested in the difference between the two you can imagine starting with. Fourteen groups of law of a randomly assigned to insecticide A or B.. And then within each. Insecticides you're in the least sign. The seven concentrations. Now suppose that we have two lines on the largest scale weight. Intercept B. to zero A and slope B. to one a full insecticide. Intercept beat A zero B. and slope. Beat up. One B. for insecticide B.. And as a first step in the analysis. We test a lot of poultices that. The two lines are to say that they have the same intercept. And the same slope essentially meaning that the two insecticides. Are not different in their ability to kill. Law five. So this implies that a single line. Would be adequate to describe the data. And there is no hypothesis is about four parameters. Actually it's about two differences. Being zero. Now. Similar to modeling. Joint joint modeling. Of two lines. In the general linear model. We can introduce. On the large it's guile and experimental factor for the insecticides. The explanatory variable. Law concentration and. Most importantly the interaction between the two. That will give us different slopes. Here you have the model. We have. Main effects. For insecticides. We have a slope. For the concentration. And we have this extra term the interaction. That will give us. Different. Slopes. For a and B.. Now here's an exercise for you will assure you that tall one. And beta one one is zero. Usual side conditions that are also imposed by R.. And you will kindly asked. To express the intercepts and slopes. In terms of the parameters in the model expression over here. And also to give an interview Taishan. For these parameters. So take your time and come back when your ready. Right. Is the answer. For insecticide I we have I is one. So we can pull the to zero and toll one together. That will give us the intercept. We can pull Beta one and beat out one. One. Together. That will give us the slope. They still are assumed to be zero. So we end up with B. to zero and B. to one being the slope. Beat or one and the intercept be to zero. For insecticide and for baby have the same story for eyes too. But this star. These two parameters are not equal to zero. So the tour two is actually the difference between the intercept for B.. And the intercept for a and a B. to one to is the difference between the slope for B.. And the slope. For at all on the logic scale. But apart from that. Quite similar to. Clips. Where we discussed parallel. And non parallel lines in the general linear model. Here's the output from our. For two lines. The important part is over here. The main effect for effect or for the two insecticides explanatory variable to regressive. And the interaction between the two. Here we have estimates. Standard errors. So that fell used P.C.'s but most of most interest. Is the difference. I've asked for here. The difference is nine point two. And it's actually an indication of the fit of the model. It's a bit comparable to the sum of squares of residual. Sum of squares of error in. Regression and Nova. Or uncover the smaller the number. The better defeat of the model. And we're going to compare the deviance. Of this model. With the deviance of the next model. Which is the model we get when we impose the knowledge poultices that means that we fit. Just a single line. With a common intercept. And a common slope. And here we have the deviance. Again. It's bigger. It's bigger. Because the model is smaller. The previous model has Morkel. Parameters. So it will fit the data better. The question is is this deviance. Big enough compared with the previous deviance. To conclude that this model. Does not fit the data well. In which case we would have to reject the null hypothesis. In order to know. We have to calculate a piece of you. And that the value will correspond to a test of the stick which is the difference between the differences of the two models. The smaller model. And the larger model. The larger model. Or the full model is the two line model. The smaller model. Or the reduced model. Is the one line model of. Taint by imposing the Nala poultices. The difference between the deviances is seventeen point four nine and. For the P.V. cell you. Connected to this difference. We need. The distribution of the tests that they stick under Denard poultices. This is our knowledge cortices. Which. Can also be expressed in terms of the difference between the intercepts. And the difference between the slopes are essentially two parameters. Are involved in this now hypothesis. The distribution of the test a to stick. The difference between the differences. Approximately is a crisis where distribution. Under the null hypothesis. And a number of degrees of freedom for that guy square. Is actually the difference between. The number of parameters of the larger model. The two lie model for parameters. And the smaller model. The one line model. With two parameters. So we have two degrees of freedom for the kind Square. So we can ask P.Q. S.. For a guy square with two degrees of freedom. We can fill in the seven point four nine for the difference between the differences. And the area to divide. If the P. value. Is point zero zero zero two. It's very small. So we conclude that. Are now law POTUS has to be rejected. And the analysis will continue with the two line model as. Next steps you might consider. Separate tests for talk to a zero. That means that you test for. Equal intercepts. Or for beat a one to is zero. Meaning that you test for people slopes. If you do so. You will probably find that a model with parallel lines. Fits the data. Quite nicely. A few Alton ends. The like to try to test is called. Likely to write your test because you can show that the difference between the two deviances. Is minus two times the longer a them. Of the rates you know of the likelihood of the smaller. And the larger model. So essentially to test that the stick is the rifleman rates fell between two likelihoods. The set this can be used to test the hypothesis. About a single parameter. The likely to write your test of course can also be used to test that same hypothesis. The pieces are often similar. But they're not quite the same and when they're very different the likelihood right your test is. Usually to be preferred. So in summary. Is that does. Can be used to test the hypothesis. About a single parameter. It involves does that score. Usually the estimate. Over the standard error. And it's usually to be found in the output of most of these to go pick it use the like to try to test. Can be used for a single parameter as well. But also for hypothesis. About several parameters together. The micro is rated as like the. F. test. In the linear model. Involves a comparison between two nested models of full or large model. In a reduced or small model. It often requires extra work. Fitting. The two models. Referring the difference between the differences to an appropriate Chis squared to get a piece right. Thanks for your attention and.

                "text": "Hello welcome back to live session about logistic regression. We are approaching the end will say. But over here. We're finally going to talk about estimation you have seen estimates. In the previous clip. And now. You're going to see how we get these estimates as to mation and. Testing actually is quite complicated for logistic regression. So obvious take myself. To the main. Teams and. I'll skip the details and. I'll try to give you a flavor of what is going on. So don't worry too much about the details. In linear regression. And Nova and. Analysis of covariance. We actually used. Least Squares estimation. And least squares estimation is fine. When you have normally distributed data. But in Logistic Regression the. Counts the number of losses a building. Killed. For instance. Are binomial. Distributed. And therefore we need an other technique for estimation. The technique is called. Maximum likelihood estimation. It will be much more appropriate. Next and like do it estimation is actually the one. Generally respected principle. In statistics it's to glue that keeps. Statistics together. It's a general method for estimation. And actually for normally distributed data. Makes a likely destination is the same as least squares as to mation. So Least Squares. Is just a special case of maximum likelihood estimation. Now to illustrate next market estimation. Will use a simple example. We show that we have only one group of twenty larvae you see them here and there. Only exposed to a single concentration. P. is the probability for the larva to die. K. is the number of dead large. And issue that we observe. OK. Is. Eight. So twelve Laws I live happily. Forever. And eight of them four. Unfortunately will have to go. The first step. Of next and likelihood estimation is to write it down to joint. Probability for the data that we observed. We observed. Eight successes. Each with a probability P.. And twelve failures. Each with a probability one minus P. assure me that the larva react. Independently. To joint probability. Is the product of eight. Piece and twelve. One minus. Piece. This function. A function of the unknown. P. is actually called. The likelihood. Here is see a plot along the vertical. We have to likelihood. P. to the power eight times. One minus P. to the power twelve. And along the horizontal. We have the probability P.. Running from zero to eight. Now let's take a value. Like point eight. Indicated by the blue arrow. You can see that the probability for the eight successes in twelve failures is rather small. That means that point eight is an unlikely value. To return. As an estimate. By contrast if we go to the red arrow that indicates failure point three. You can see that the probability for. Eight successes and twelve fair use is actually quite high. So Point three is a much more likely failure to return as an estimate. Now. If you add here to this sort of principle. The most likely value to return as an estimate is a failure point for. Over here. Where we have the highest probability. For the eight successes. And twelve failures. To occur. And point four. Is actually the next my cute. As to Matt. The result makes sense because we had eight. Successes. Out of twenty eight over twenty of course. Is point four. So we don't need an X. and Y. clued in this. Rather simple example. But it also works. In more complicated situations. When we have seven groups of law fight with seven different concentrations. We can also formulate the likelihood. As the joint probability of. The observed. Numbers of law of a being killed. It's a somewhat more complicated function of. Two parameters. Because each probability depends upon the into said Peter zero. And the slope. Be to one for the two maximum likelihood estimates for B. to zero and B. to one. Again. The likelihood will take its. Lot used. Value. Which respect to the mathematics. The maximum likelihood. Estimates are obtained by equating the two derivatives. Of the likelihood with respect to be to zero and B. to one to zero. It will give you two equations that you can solve. But often makes them likely to estimates are derived. Numerically by a computer algorithm that searches for the maximum of. L.. And for various reasons. The log likelihood is used. Rather than the likelihood itself I'll just give you one reason. The like the OED itself. Under independence is a product. Remember. Be to the power eight times one minus B. to the power twelve. That's a product of twenty terms. When you take a lot of. Logarithm. You get a sum and sums. According to the central limit theorem. Behave as if they follow. A normal distribution. And that's heavily used in the theory. Now it's also possible to obtain. Approximate standard errors. Of the maximum likelihood estimate theirs and. We can derive them. From second order derivatives. Of the local rhythm of the likelihood. The second order the refitted. Reflects. The shape of the log likelihood. Around. The maximum. And narrow pointed shape. Corresponds to a small. Standard error. Because there is only a narrow range of values. Around to make some likelihood estimates that are likely it quickly drops off. A flat shape by contrast. Means that there are many values. A wide range of values. Around the maximum likelihood estimates that are also likely. That means. Watch. Standard errors. Details are beyond the scope of discourse I'm afraid. So here you have. Are again. You have already seen this output. We have looked to the estimates and. Here are the standard errors. As well. They are derives from the second order. Derivatives. All done nicely. In the background. For you by our. Now before we close this presentation. We have one example left it's a bit of a silly example but nevertheless. In this example. You have to guess what. Soccer match. Has been played a parameter called. M. for match. Takes. Either value one. Which corresponds to the match between Ajax and P.S. feel. What it takes value. To where we have. Ajax. Against football club. FLOCK Vedat now. Ajax and P.S.V. are two teams in the top. Leak. Of the Netherlands. But football club fluff there is a football club. In a very small place. It's a veteran team of people over fifty. And they only play on Saturdays when that doesn't drain. You have to guess which match is being played and. The observations you get. Are actually the score twenty five. To nil. Now unless you don't know anything about soccer. You will all guess that the. Estimate for. M. is value. To. Because the probability for a score twenty five to nil. When professionals. Play against. Amateurs. Is very high. But a score of twenty five to nil between. Ajax and P.C. to professional teams. Is very low. So you actually applied. The next Michael principle. You. Estimated by their value. Where your data score. Has the highest probability to occur. It shows that the principle of the next one like that estimation is used. Every day. In everyday life for instance when you cross the street. And you are in an uncertain situation when you see a car approaching. OK In summary. Parameters and logistic regression. Like intercept and slope for the insecticide data. Are estimated by maximum likelihood. The likelihood is the joint probability for the data that we observed. Maximum likelihood. Estimates are. The parameter values. Where. L.T. exists lodges tell you some day corresponds to the mechs in them. Of the likelihood. And often this maximum is determined. Numerically. By a computer algorithm. From the shape of the log like the earth. Around the next one actually expressed in terms of second order derivatives. Approximate standard errors can be obtained as well. I'd. Thank you for your attention. And I hope to see you in the next. And last clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello. Welcome back through this series of clips. About logistic regression. Let me show you where we are on the map. When actually over here. We have introduced the ingredients of the model. And we're going to talk about. All it's all trade shows. And what you think. But are two clips left. About estimation. And testing. Now let me recall the example where we had seven groups of twenty laws. Each. Each group was exposed to a concentration of an insecticide to different concentration. Concentrations were randomly assigned to the groups. We have independence between groups. And for each group. The number of larvae that was killed was recorded and. Laws are issued to react in the pendant leaf from each other to the insecticide for the eyes group. I running from one to seven. We have a probability P.. I for an insect. To die and. Through the large IT leg. P.-I is connected to the concentration. X. I the group. Is exposed to the proportion. Why I is the number. K. i killed in a group. Over twenty and. The number killed K.-I is following a binomial distribution. The total. Over here is the group size and. Here is the probability. For the particular group. This is how it looks like you are affected with concentrations. X.. Here we take the longer them of X.. Here we have the number of large that are killed. And we also need. The number that survives. Both numbers are in here. In days G.L.M. routine and. You can see that we have one. Explain the three variable that's the log of a them of X.. And we ask for a blind Amil distribution. We don't have to ask for the legit link because it's to default. In this kinds and. G.L.M. is actually standing for did generalized. Linear model. Not to general. But to generalize to leading a model that's quite a big difference. We could ask for a summary of. Coefficients. Here we have the estimates. This is the estimate in green. For the intercept to be to zero. And this is the estimate in blue. For the slope. Be to one and the other elements of this terrible. Will be touched upon. In the next clips. So when we replace the the zero and. Beetle one. By their estimates and. In the next clip. You will see how these estimates are obtained. This is the fifth relationship. And we can actually make up a plot of that relationship. You can see it. Over here. You can see in red. That we are fitting a signal that curve shaped girth. That is actually running from zero. Over here. To one over there. Now here's an exercise for you. If you like a mathematics. Place fairy fi. That when we make the plot. That P. is connected with X.. By this relationship. In blue. Over here. If you don't like mathematics don't worry. You can just skip it and go to the next slide where I will explain how you can get this relationship. So here's the answer. The logic of P. is the law Galt's and. This is to fit its relationship. The linear predictor. The fitted fortune of the linear predictor. We can take the exponential both sides. So here we have the also here we have the exponential of the linear predictor. Then we can turn its. One minus P. a round. If you turn around here you get one hour for the exponential. One hour for the exponential is the same as. Multiplying within the exponential with minus one. So you get a plus here instead of a minus. And a minus here. Instead of a plus. Then you can divide. One by P. and. People IP. And then we can move the one. To the other side. If it is. And finally we turn the one. Over P. Around to get B. and this will become one. Over this expression. It looks rather gruesome. But. Well. Software won't mind and. You can easily make a plot by choosing a range of values for X. you can easily do it in our. For instance. OK. The logistic regression model is actually a log. Ault's model. And just suppose that we look at the difference of calling. Delta between the launch it's of two probabilities so large it. P two minus lot U.P.A. one is. Delta we say that we have a difference Delta. On the launch its scale. A difference between two large it is a difference between two law Galt's. And a difference between two logarithms is the same as the log rhythm of the rates. So we get the log or them. Of the. Ots rates you know. Being equal to Delta. So we also write show itself. Is the exponential of Delta. So that's the attraction of the watch at link when you use a logic link. It's very easy to translate. Differences on the watch it scale. Into also writes Yes. Let's see how it works out for the insecticide data. We're going to compare the probability for the larva to die. When we apply. Concentration. Seeing. And we going to compare that with. Twice that concentration. To see. So the one. The probability to die connected. To concentration C. and P. two. Is the probability connected to concentration to see the longer enough to see is the logarithm of. Two plus the logarithm of C.. So that's how I get this expression. When we take the difference between the two expressions. Most of it will cancel. Except this last term. That's our difference Delta. On the logic scale. In this case. The alternates yell. As we saw in the previous slide. Is the exponential of Delta. So the odds ratio itself. When we estimate it is obtained by taking the exponential. Of the. Estimate for Delta Delta is beat a one times Mach two so when we plug in the estimate for B. to one. The one point eight. Etc. We get an answer for the all straight which is three point five. So when the concentration is doubled and the concentration. The Also for the law of a to die. Increase by an estimated factor of three point five. That's a way to express how fast the probability. To die. Increases. With the concentration. Now what about the interpretation of Peter's zero. And beat of one. Well. Beta one determines how fast. P.. Increases with. In this case the log of rhythm of X. and. Consequently with. X. itself. The larger B. to one. The more steep the as. Curve. Will be. When beat as. One is zero. It means that the curve is horizontal. And in that case there won't be any relationship between the probability to die. And the concentration X.. Be to zero. Actually corresponds to the value zero for the block of X.. And that's. Attained. When the concentration is equal to one. When you change B. to zero. The S. curve. Is shifted to the left or to the right. But the shape. Will remain the same. So in summary. Fitting a logistic regression model implies that an S. shaped curve is fitted primitive B. to one. Determines the steepness of the curve higher B. to one meaning. A steeper curve. Parameter be to zero. Determines the location of the curve for smaller beat us zero. The curve moves to the right to the right and for larger B. to zero it moves to the left a difference. Of delta between launch it's of two probabilities. Referred to as a difference on the launch it scale. Actually corresponds to one odds ratio of. The exponential. Of Delta. So thanks for your attention and. I hope to see you back in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello. Welcome back to this series of clips. About logistic regression. Let me show you on the map where we are going to start the second clip. I showed you in the previous clip. That the data set that we talked about cannot really be analyzed by ordinary. Linear regression. And I promised you. Another technique that you stick aggression. That was suitable for. Binary data. And we're going to talk about the ingredients. Of the logistic regression model. Off the debt. We're going to talk a bit more about logistic regression. And we'll end up with. Estimation and. Testing which is a bit hard going. I guess. OK. Simple regression. Fitting a straight line. To the proportions we had in our example. Remember we had the seven groups of law of a. Twenty law for each. Exposed to different concentrations of insecticides. And its laws they can die. Or not in that case. Simple regression did not respect the fact that the proportions. And the probabilities P.. As well. Are between zero and one. So. To remove. Problems with a lower bound to zero. And the upper bound of one. We going to use a mathematical trick and. Afterwards. On the data I will check that. This trick. Indeed works. We're not going to model. Probabilities. P.. But we're going to model. G.. Of P. where G. is a function that transforms values between zero and one. Into failures. Running from minus to plus infinity. So function G. actually. Stretches the enter fall from zero to one for probabilities P. to the interval. Running from minus. To plus infinity. This function G. is called the link function. There are many link functions. But a popular choice. For binary data. Is the launch of link function. It is actually defined as the local rhythm of the Ault's. And as a second. Try our first try was simple regression. For the model. We now assure you that at launch it. Of. P S B to zero. Plus B. to one. Times. X.. And as a short. Exercise your kindly asked to fair a five that. Indeed. Probabilities are stretched by checking that's for probabilities zero. Off. And one. When you apply the Laci plink. You get. Minus infinity. Zero and. Plus infinity. So take your time. To convince yourself that. This is true. And then come back. Right. To support our choice of models. We would like to plot against X.. And the plot. Should look like a straight line. Unfortunately we don't know the value of any of the seven. Piece. So we use observe proportions Y. instead. What we will actually do in the plot is. We will put. Empirical March it's defined. Like this against. X.. The concentration. Here's an exercise. First of all. There's a question. You would probably have expected to plot. The logo in them of Y over one minus why against X.. I guess. Ross to check that this is actually the same as plotting the log or them of. K. over twenty minus K. A against X. That's nearly this expression. And the last question is Where do you think the point five are coming from what motivated to at. Point five. To the numerator and denominator. So. Take your time. And when you're ready come back. And we'll go through the answers. Together. Right. Here you have the questions. Here you have the odds. Yes of course. We expect it to plot. The luxury them of why. Over one minus why against X.. Because we were replacing. P. in the large expression by Y.. If you look at that it's pression. Be replaced by Y. you can plug in that Y. is K. L. for twenty. You can multiply it with twenty top and bottom. And you end up with a longer enough. K. over twenty minus K.. We're nearly there. There are two slight problems here. In general. First of all when. K. is zero. We get the low grade M of zero. And that's why we add a hard to K. to remove the problem. Second of all. When Case twenty eight we get. Division by zero. And again. We fight you a little and add a half. To the denominator as well. And that way. We end up with the empirical. Margit as an estimate for than what you people. Now has to plot. It's a bit unfortunate after all this fuss because it doesn't look like a straight line. At all. Fortunately we're dealing with concentrations here. And often it helps to replace concentrations by their log of them. So let's give that a try and plot. And political lodge it's not against X.. But against a locally them of X.. And here's the plot. And this time. It looks quite like a straight line. The points are struggling a little but of course. We're not using the actual piece. But. Estimates for the peats. So our final model. Will be logic P.. Being equal to be to zero. Plus B. to one times. The local rhythm of X.. Now beef. We proceed. Please note that the empirical logic here is only used to make a preliminary plot. To motivate to substantiate. Our choice of model. In the actual analysis that will follow in the next clips. No in Pickel more tits or data transformation will be used. The part over here. Circled in red. Is called. The linear predictor. In general in more complicated problems. In this general predictor you can have all the ingredients. You're already used to from. Regression and know for what and so in here. You could have. Main effects. Interactions. Explanitory variables. Regressors call variants. Whatever you like of course. It is called a linear predictor. In the same way as a linear model is called linear. Because the parameters that are in here. Are in there. In a linear fashion. The link function finally. Is called. The link function. Because it. Links. Probability P.. To the linear predictor. We saw that. The binomial distribution is being used. Rather than the normal distribution. And just to show you how did this to be ocean looks like. I asked for the binomial. With a total of twenty two groups size and my wife an illustration. A probability of point eight. The expected number of law of a to die. In this case. Is twenty times. Eight point eight. Because we expect. Eighty percent of the loss rate. In the sample to die. And you see this sixteen. The expected value of there. In general the number twenty. Call to divine Amil total. Is denoted by. The letter and. So we talk about a binomial distribution. With parameters. And and people. Let's have a look at the variance because we concluded in the previous quiet. Slide that it was not. Constant The variance of K.. According to properties of the binomial distribution is. N. times. Pete Times. One minus P. were and is twenty. The variance of Y. Y. being. K. over N.. Is P. times one minus P. over. And so in times one minus be divided by twenty. So as we surmised in a previous clip. The variance. Is not constant. And you can check for yourself. That the variance is small. When P. is close to zero or one. And that it takes its largest value. When P.. Is equal to one half. So in summary. In a logistic regression model. The link function. Links a probability P.. To the in your predictor. Like the the zero plus B. to one times the log random of X.. In our example here. We discussed. The logic link function to log all its. In a linear predictor. You can introduce main effects. Interactions. Explanatory variables. All the stuff you used to from the linear model that we have discussed in this course before. The basic data. They eat up or larva. In your example a binary. Either zero. For failure. Or one for success. The number of successes. K.. Follows a blind or real distribution. Parameters and and. P. and. The binomial total. In this case is the group size of. Twenty the variance. Of a proportion. Our response. Is not constant. It depends on P.. Thanks for your attention. And see you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this series of clips. About logistic regression and. Obviously when I will show you on the map where we are. We are at the very beginning over here. I'm going to introduce the subject. And I'm going to show by example. That ordinary regression that we discussed before won't do. And it we really need something new we're going to talk about the ingredients. Of this new model. We going to talk about. All its faults radios and something called the link function. And will end up with. Estimation and. Testing. But the introduction first. We have a dataset here. Where we have seven groups of. Larvae twenty. Laws in each group and. Each group. Is exposed to a different concentration of insecticide and the. Concentrations are randomly assigned to the groups. And in each group. We record. The number of laws that are killed. OK. And we assure you that. A larva. Reacts. Independently from the other larva to the insecticide. What interstate. In the relationship between the proportion of insect scale to the expected proportion actually. And the concentration X.. Now the proportion killed. Why. Is Kate. Over twenty. And at it why. To the data file. The problem looks like a regression problem. We know. The concentration. X.. We want to guess about the proportion killed. Y.. So let's. As a first try. Start with simple. Regression. Why is an intercept. Plus a slope times X.. Plus the usual error term epsilon at the end of the systematic Bart. The first part. Re presents the expected value of Y.. And in this case. Because we're talking about proportions. The expected value is the proportion of laws that would be killed in the underlying population. After exposure to concentration X.. So we have. Proportions guy over twenty. We have our. Regression model and our systematic thought. Can be called P. formally. We should call it P. of. X. because it depends upon experts. We will just use. P.. In the next slides. And take the. Pendants upon. X. for granted. When we take a random law from the population. Exposed at large to concentration X.. The probability for that Marfa to die. Is actually as well. So P.. Is the expected value of Y.. It is the proportion of lawful killed in the population and. It is the probability. For a written law for to be killed. Here you have a plot. Where we have proportions. Why. Against concentrations. X.. And the seven dots are corresponding to the seven groups of larvae. And. We have fitted a simple. Regression line it's the red line. And you can see that it doesn't follow. The data. Well at all. Actually you can see that the data. The proportions. Tend to level off. They have to because they cannot be bigger than one. But the regression line doesn't care. It simply runs on it produces. If it fell you over here that's an estimate a probability. At the highest concentration of twenty four. Of one point. Eighteen. Which is a little embarrassing. Of course. So we can see that our. Linear model. Is not doing very well. We need something that is definitely more complicated. To fit the relationship between the perp. And the concentrations. What about another assumption. Of our. Regression model. Yes sumption of constant variance. Well. When the concentration X. is large. Probability P. will be close to one. If we assume that there is no immunity. In that case. In any group. Most of the larvae will be killed. So you will see little. Variance in. Why. When the concentration X. is small piece you will be close to zero awfully. And the larvae will be killed. And again. Variation in Y. will be small frame for immediate values of X.. Let's say for. Values of fee in the middle. We expect the largest set a Geisha. So the variance is not constant. It depends upon X.. Through the probability P.. What about normality. Well. Why is the proportion is between zero and one. And it only takes values zero one zero for twenty two over twenty nine thousand nine hundred twenty. Until one. And quite possibly the normal approximation. Is quite poor in this case. Actually we can show from. Theoretical considerations that the number of law faded is killed in a group. K.. Follows a so-called. Binomial distribution. This is the distribution of the number of successes. K. and a success. Means a lot of A being killed in twenty. Independent trials. Each larva. Is a trial and. Each trial. Has a probability P.. For Success. There are two parameters here. One is. The group size twenty. The other is the unknown. Probability. And of course. The distribution of the proposed. And why will follow. It simply the binomial defied by twenty. The non-linearity. To Heathrow deny you to your variance. And the non-normality. All relate to the simple fact that the data per larva. Are not continuous. But their binary Alofa either survives. Which we can lean out guys zero or it is killed. Which weekend in out by a one. A proportion Y.. Which is K. all for N. and. Being twenty to group size is simply the song Paul. Mean. Of the binary observations. Of the larvae in a group. After exposure to concentration X.. Of course. The probability P. is simply the population mean of the binary observations of all possible larvae after exposure to concentration X.. In the next clip. We will look at. Logistic Regression. Which is a regression technique that is appropriate for binary response data. So in summary. Because concentrations are randomly assigned to groups of law. At least we have independent observations. That's the only assumption of the linear model that holds here actually. The relationship between P N X. Cannot be adequately represented by a straight line. We need something more complicated. The variance is not constant. It depends upon X.. For a probability spi the distribution of proportions is not normal. It follows from a binomial distribution. So simple regression. Is not appropriate here. We need something new which is called. Logistic Regression. And will be introduced in the next clips. Thanks for your attention. And I hope to see you in the next ten second clip. Of this series.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this series of clips. About the categorical data. Or data. Organized in tables. Let me show you on the map where we are. We're actually here. At the very last clip. We have been talking about Pearson's chi square test. For goodness of fit. Pearson sky square test for independence and homogeneity. We have been talking about fishes exact asked for the two by two table. And we go on to look at a two by two table again. But this time. We're going to talk about Ault's And also if you want to know more about alternators There's also a series of clips. About logistic regression. Now let me recall the example where we had fourteen. Vellum least selected plans for for writing a. Five being infected. And sixteen. Randomly Selected plans are for right to be twelve. Being infected or interested in the probabilities Pi one and pi two for plants and for I.T. or for righty B. to be infected. Now rather than. Look at probabilities. You can also look at all its. The all its. For a plant. Of writing. A To be infected. Is defined as pile one. Over one minus by one it's actually the probability for infection. Over the probability. For no infection. The estimate for the probability pile one. Is five. Out of fourteen. That's point three six. We can put it into the expression for the oughts and. Out. We get the point five six. On the slide so point five six is the odds for a plant or for the righty. A To be infected and. Likewise for fry to be ready also apply to over one minus Pie two. We can estimate pi two by twelve. Out of sixteen point seven five. Put it in the expression. And out. We get three. Rather than look at differences between probabilities. We can also look at rates of all it's so here's the oughts rates you know. It's simply the odds for infection. For a over the odds. For infection. For B.. If you want to estimate the alternates you know. We simply. Substitute. The estimates for pi one and pi two the five over fourteen. Over here and the twelfth over sixteen. Over there. Out. We get point. Nineteen. A quicker way to get there. Is to take the product. Five times for a longer diagonal. And divide by the product. Nine times twelve. Along the other. Diagonal. Now we have got an estimate for the alternates you know but if you provide an estimate you have to provide a measure of accuracy as well. So we going to look at a conference had to fall for the all to rights you know. The usual into Vol one point nine five into full is the estimate. Plus or minus one point nine six times the standard error. This is based on a normal approximation. But that does not work out well in this case. The reason is that the distribution of. The estimated also ratio tends to be rather skewed while the normal distribution. Is symmetric. Actually the distribution of the longer rhythm of the estimate for the odds ratio. Is much closer to a normal distribution. And that's what we're going to use. Next. When we look at the distribution of the local rhythm of the estimated also rates you know. It can be approximated by a normal distribution. The mean. Would be the log reading of the true value of the odds ratio. The standard definition. Is the square root of the sum of the in first use of the four numbers. In the table. That will give you point eight zero two eight. Now. It's a first step. We're going to construct an interval for the luxury the mafia all trade show. So we've got the. Estimate over here. Plus or minus one point nine six times the standard error. That we just calculated on the previous slide. When you plug in. The estimate for the alternate yo. And for the standard there. This is the interval that you're going to get. It's not. And into four we want to have. Because we want an interval. For the also radio itself. So. To get back from the luxury them of you all to a cell phone. To the outside show itself. We take the exponential function. So we take the exponential function of the lower bound. And of the upper bound and. Finally we get an interval. For the oughts ratio itself. Running from point zero three eight two point eight nine. Note that this interval. Does not contain value one. Value one. Alternates are equal to one. Means Pi one being equal to pipe two it agrees with the car square approximation. For the test of. Almost united that we looked at before. Because the profit. The now hypothesis of. Equal probabilities. Was In that case. Rejected value was point zero three below. Point out five. However with Fisher's Exact hest. And the same hypothesis. There was no rejection. Because the piece L U was pointed out six. So what should we think about that. Well. In this case. Our interval. Is a bit suspect. Because the numbers in the table. Are quite small. Unfortunately there's another interval of I of all as well. It's an exact. Confidence interval. That is related to Fisher's exec. Dest. We only looked at Fisher's Exact S.P. forward to test. Equal probabilities that's not right one but it can actually be used for other. The use of the Olds right you know as well. And if we collect all the values that are not. Rejected by the test. Together. We get an exact interval. Here you can see how it is calculated in R. and it's running from point zero two eight to one point twelve and this time. One is in the interval. Because it was not. Rejected by Fisher's exact test. Let's have a look at another table with larger numbers to see how the two types of into full the approximate in your exact one compare. Then. So we have quite large numbers we have three thousand. Employee needs and. We're interested. How that opinion. About a company's new health plan. Whether they are favorable or unfavorable. Is affected by their job stress which can be low or high. Your kindly invited in your own time. To calculate the approximate into full you can do it by hand. And also you can copy the program. To our program from the previous slide. And calculate the exact into full. What you will see as that both. Intervals are virtually the same. So in summary. We defined. Ault's And he also writes Yup. Faults. Incidentally. Are offered by bookmakers. When your bet on horses or dogs. And it's good to know that you also offered. Are against the horse. Or the dog. Winning. Fishes idea for inference conditional on the margins we fixed the margins with Fischer's exact. Test. Can be applied for. Other values for the alternates yo. Then one. To sell. Collecting all the values. For the else right show. Not rejected by fishes exact as we can get an exact confidence interval. We can also do arrive in a proc. Some of the confidence interval based on a normal approximation is much more easy to calculate. For small numbers. The intervals can be quite different. And probably it's safer to use fish's exact interval for large numbers. There's no difference between the two intervals. Thank you for attention. And see you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello again. Welcome to this. Fourth clip. On linear models and in this clip we go on to look at models with a common intercept but different slopes. We show you in a map where we are. So after the introduction we looked at bottle with. Parallel lines. And author that model for different intercepts different slopes and now we look at models with a common intercept. For different slopes. Again. The SO ph example. So we look at the PH of the soil after it in the Strait of lime. Two types of lime A and B. and. We have a corner that if you press of which is the amount of lime. And earlier we fit at first the lines and after that models were different in the steps in different slopes. And this was the result. And once again how do you like this model. Well it doesn't look bad at all actually. But there are a few strange things here. Well if you look at the data first. So here we half observations. Where the amount of lime is zero but still it is a five eight. And here we have. We didn't apply any lime at all but still it's a five B. That's a bit strange isn't it. And actually in the model that we have used here. We allow. Different intercepts and. Meaning that the mean Ph. If A is not applied. Is not the same as. The mean ph if lime. B. is not applied. So does the strange things and. So it makes sense here. To fit a model. With the same starting point with a common intercept. And how should that be done well that's quite straightforward the only thing that we need to do is we have two X.. Klute the dummy D B. In the regression model. But still include. X. in the product X. B.. Which is the product of the dummy. And X.. So the systematic part of the model just looks like this because hero was beaten one times the amount of lime. But be the one B. times. The product. To him. And if you split with respect to the two types of lime you just see it happening. If we have an observation from the reference group where the demi is zero and also X B is hero then we are left with B. does evil plus B. to one time sex which is the equation for the reference group. And then we have an observation from the B. type of Lyme. But the demi is one. And X B is equal to X. itself. Then we are left with B. the zero. Plus will be to one. Plus B. to one B.. Time tax. So we again here is a graphical representation we see that we have a common intercept be deceived. Oh and we have two different slopes. Slow be to be the one in the reference group. And B. to one place be to one B.. Indeed in the B. group. So we have this common starting point B. to zero. It all starts from here. So how is that obtained in our. Well here is the linear regression model. We put X. in the model. And its product X. be. And here are the least. Ques estimates of the parameters and a common. Intercept. Here is estimated to be five point seven five nine. That's all you offer here. And again there is no need to define these dummies or predictions self. It can be done by our. Make sure that the af. Is known as a factor and specify this product. Using F. X.. Well what are the data telling us about this idea of a model with a common intercept. The data contained indications for a common intercept. So let's start now from a model with different. Intercepts and different slopes. And then. Just let's test no hypothesis. So don't know how processes that we're interested in is Peter zero B. is equal to zero. In words. In. Is saying that the intercepts are equal. And a common intercept model is good enough. And again can be done with a T. test or could be done with it. After us for a full on a reduced model. So we start with the model with two in deception to slopes and. We just pick out the line from the. The summary output that contains. This parameter B. to C. or A B.. It's actually the second line into the little matrix. And here is the estimate of this. Difference in intercepts. With standard error and we did. Do you value in a P. value. If you do. The F. test. We have to fit the full model. Which is the model with different intercepts and different slopes. In the food model for here. And we have to fit the reduced model. And the reduced model is the model with a common intercept. And with the an over function we can make it we can construct the ESTA to stick with P. value. So what we find here. Both from with the T. test and with F. this to be the equal to zero point zero nine two larger than threshold of five percent. So the conclusion would be not to reject the no hypothesis. So intercepts are not found to be different here and is example. In other words and. A model with a common intercept seems to be good enough. Well we could also use a different parameters sation. Maybe a more logical way of writing today that would be to follow ng. Instead of working with factor. And with the amount of lime. We could also define to ferryboats X A N X B. Telling how much of which type of wine was supplied. So deferrable X.. A as the actual amount of lime. If an observation. If it tells you how much lime. Of type abs. Applied. And if variable X.P. tell us how much of lime of Tybee was applied. And we can just fit to multiple regression model beaters year old place be. Upon A Time Sex A plus B. there won't be times X. B. plus Absalom. This would automatically. Give us the common intercept model. And different slopes. But in a different way. There is no reference group. If we formulate the model like this. OK. It can be done in are we here we define X A N X B. We put them. X A N X P into the repression model and we get the intercept. And we get to two different slopes. Those. Slopes that we see here are directly dislocate into groups. And there is no difference parameter now. In summary a linear model with a common interest that the different slopes. As a systematic part of it at least one call fair bit and an interaction of effect a with the coffee area. The model in I know for notation can be written in this way. Where we have a reference group B. to zero as B. to one times X.. But we need to what I time six I was in error in this. Written in this way those parameters be the one I are differences in slopes. Comparing group by with a reference. And B. to zero is the common intercept. And parametrize ation without reference group. Directly the slopes in the groups that can be handy in some cases. Thanks for your attention and see you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this third clip on the linear model where we will discuss. Models with different slopes. Let me show you in a map where we are. So we've seen the introduction into linear models we've seen models with parallel lines and how we here look at model for different slopes and the example that I would like to discuss is again. The SO ph example. There are fifty soils. And there is effect or. Type of lime. Factor af. Which two levels. We have a and B. type of lime and. We have a quantitative recursive which is the amount of lime. And earlier we fitted a paralyzed model. As. Why is B. the zero plus B. the zero B. D. D. B. plus B. The one time sex person epsilon where D. B. is the dummy for the type B.. Lime. Here is the dummy. Is one if we have an observation from the B. group C. or otherwise. And here is defeated model. Well how do you like this model where it doesn't look so bad but. If you look better you see a few. Strange things. For instance. At high high amount of lime in the B. group only upset faces are lower than what the model predicts. But here it's your way around. One on the left hand side. All the. Ph is a higher than what the model predicts. It seems here that actually for the blue line. For the the B. type of lime. This repression lies a bit too steep. And in the. Type ADA Reference Group. The red line here is not steep enough so it may very well be reasonable to have different slopes here. So we need model with different intercepts and different slopes for the two types of lime. But within one single model. OK the method to do that is to calculate a product X. be a product of to do with the requests or X.. So that's done here. Most rightmost column here. In this data set X. B. which is zero. If we have an observation. From the. Type a lime. And it's equal to X.. The amount of lime applied. If we have an observation from the B. group. And then we add this product to him X P S are requested to the multiple regression model. Actually this product X. be it introduces an interaction between a factor in the Gulf area it allows the effect of the coffee I.V. it. To be different at different factor levels. So here's the systematic part of the model now. Where we have the intercept. Close to zero be times the dummy. Be the one X.. With me the one B. times this product. Requests. If you split with respect to the type of lime that you see that. The a group where demis equal to zero. We end up with B. does hero plus B. to one time tax. As the regression line. If you have an observation from the B. type of lime where the demis equal to one. We end up with. Intercept B. does here Opus B. to C. or B. plus. Slope. Peter one. But B. to one B. times X.. So we see two different repression equations with different intercept and different slopes. So here is a graphical representation of the situation we see the two requests felines the blue one. And the red wonder blue for the type B. in the red one for the type eight. The reference group. We see that. We have two different intercept B. to zero. If you have an observation from the. Type a lime and intercept B. to zero plus B. dizzy or a B.. If you have an observation from the time B. line. Lime. And we have to slopes to one in the reference group A and B. to one place be the one B. for an observation and a Type B. a line. It's actually does B. to one B. It measures the difference. Since slope. Between type B.. And the reference type eight. In this specific example this beetle one B. is negative. Because the slope. The blue. The slope of the blue line. Is smaller than the slope of the red line. OK how is this obtained in our well we need to create. The dummy. We need to create the product requested D.P. times. X.. And we put D.S. into regression model as requests his interest in the dummy plus X. plus X P. And next. We do to requestion we asked for the least efficient. And you find him over here. Beat the one B.. Is estimated to be minus zero point zero five for telling you that the slope into B. group is point zero five four lower than the slope in their veterans group. Reference Group eight. Well as before. There is no need to do this which itself you don't need to define demis. And these products yourself are can do it for you. But you have to make sure that. Atthis effector and is spread a term is obtained if you specify in the model F.. Call an X.. As is done here so. After goes into the modeled effect of plus X. plus F. call them X.. And the results are identical. OK. The fitted model here. If you split with respect to the two types of lime. Just pick out the. The relevant qualifications. Five point seven eight one. Is the intercept. And a group and. Point zero eight six. Is this is the slope in the reference group A. And if we have an observation from the B. type of lime. We have to modify the intercept. With this term. Minus point zero for three. And we have to modify. Have to add this term here. For the slope. Minus point zero five four. And in the end. The question equation for Type B. is. I went seven three eight point zero three two times X.. So this. Second regression line. Starts a bit lower. And it has a slope which is much lower than the slope in the reference group. OK Well actually the repression queer fissions that we obtain in this way can be obtained in the simpler way. We can do simple regression for Taipei. And for Tybee separately. And we would get the same intercept and slopes. So if we can do it in the simple way. Why are we doing that in this difficult way then what's the merit of fitting a single model for both types simultaneously. Well the main reason is just that we can do statistical inference now. So we may ask whether the model with different slopes is better than. The parallel lines model or. Face this in the hypothesis. The two slopes are equal in the two groups for a same premise. No hypothesis says that B. to one B.'s equal to zero. For is the alternative would be the one B.'s not equal to zero. OK this is just an. No hypothesis for an individual slope so remember from regression that can be handled with a T. test. Because it concerns a single parameter. Or we can use the more general after us to compare a fool and the reduced model. OK Let's look first look at the T. test. So if we ask for the least Quest. Estimates of the parameters. Together with the standard errors and with the detail used in the P. values over here. Using this summary function. We can pick out the detested to stick for this difference since in slopes. Which is minus eight point nine one. And which is just. The estimate defined by the standard error actually and we get a preview which is fairly small words almost equal to zero so the WHO clue should is clear we reject this no hypothesis and we must conclude that the slopes are really different. If we want to take the F. test for food and reduce models. Well we have to fit. The full model and the reduced model. Well the food model is the model with a different slopes into different into steps. And the reduced model is just the parallel lines model that we fitted in the earlier clip. So those two models. And used the N L four function to construct the F. statistic. In this case the F.. Is equal to seventy nine point four. Which by the waist the square. Of the articles that. Detest artistic and. The P. value. Is given here. Almost equal to zero. The same P. value that we got from the from the T. test. And the conclusion is the same we really check the no hypothesis. And we conclude that the slopes are different. OK let's have a look at the second example about birth weights. And the smoking of the model. So we look at. Depend a fair ball. Why the birth weight of the baby we effect is smoking with two levels and. The quantitative regress or X. which is generation off the pregnancy. The here is the full model where we allow different intercepts and different slopes. And this is the result that we get from that model. Here we have to parallel lines model. This is the result that we get a better life situation. And the models here are both phrased in the NOVA. Notation. To get the S. the to stick. For testing whether this P.T.O. one parameter. Is equal to is equal to zero. We fit the food model. We fit the reduce model and. With the end of a function we get the F. statistic. Which turns out to be one point five four. Deplete value equal to point twenty two larger than the let's say five percent threshold level. And the conclusion would be that we do not reject the no hypothesis here. Slopes are not found to be different. So in other words. This model with their alliance. Seems to be good enough here. Which is nice. In summary. Linear model with different intercepts and different slopes has a systematic part. With at least one factor. And at least one call faery it. With interaction. And the interaction between factor in the Gulf area is incorporated. Using a product of. Dummy with. Gulf area versus. In a no for notation the model can be written in this way. B. does hero players. Talk which will give you two different intercepts to be the one X. must be the one I X I J. This will give you two different slopes. The different groups. Typically in our defer spec to level access to reference group. And what does permit to say sion. Those parameters are differences in intercepts. And parameters. B. to one eye are differences in slopes Barry. Group I with. The reference group. Hypothesis Testing for interception slopes can be done by T. tests the next tests. As we did in regression. Thanks for your attention. As you know next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this. First clip on the general linear model and. ON CALL FROM. Let me show you what's on the program. So in this first clip. We start with an introduction into the linear model and here you see the topics that we will see in the following clips of Patel Now we looked at repression. And I know five and in Re question that I know far we have a quantitative dependent variable Y.. Which is related to explain the very favorable review. Model. Look like that like B. does your opus be to one X. one particular two X. two. And the Exxon I are. Explanatory fables. Which are quantitative. Like humanity. Age. Density. Maybe to square of density. But also dummies could be used in the NOVA model. A model were written in this way. Why R.J. is new post. I place epsilon I J. In this case the expanded her fair balls are. Qualitative effect us and we want to compare the levels of these factors. Examples. Type of tomato gender. For instance now recall that Nova model. Can also be written as every question model. Using dummies. For instance for effect or with three levels. You would need two dummies. To me one. To me to hear. And you could write down the one way I know for a model in the repression way. Well if you question and I know models are X are both off. Linear Models. And in the linear model we have a quantitative response Y.. Which is written as a sum of a systematic part and of a random part. The systematic part. Is linear in the parameters and for the venom part. And the end of term epsilon we have a set of assumptions. We have seen them already. Many times. In short the errors are supposed to come from a normal distribution with mean zero. A constant fear of being sick or epsilon. And are independent. So. The abbreviation L M stands for general linear model. Or linear model for short. If you find any brief Geale am it probably means generalized linear model. Which is not the same. OK well. So we know how to handle cases where we only have quantitative regress. We use regression. And situation where we only have factors. We use I know. But what to do. If we have both. OK let's let's look at the number of examples. First example I want to show you an example about soils. On which the PH is measured after line he said. To the soil. The fact of lime is that the PH is increased so here's the dataset. Why is the system. So Ph. Fifty thousand years over here. We have a column called Ask which is the chai pot of lime to were actually two types of lime. Applied. So that's the factor. And we have a column. X. which is the amount of lime that we're I dizzier one two four eight units applied. The quantitative request. There are twenty five souls with lime Taipei. At five doesn't use. And we have twenty five cells with one five B. at five the Such as. Well the objectives of these studies to quantify the relationship between the amount of lime and the SO Ph. For a and the B. type of lime separately. And also to compare the relationships between A and B. are two different slopes. Needed or not. Well. Using simple linear regression. We can just fit to simple. The new regression model for a data only. And we get this result. And we could do it forward to the B. day Dolly. And we would get that result. But what we would like to have is a single model for both groups where this would be to. So you found that you have this such a procedure would be that you can do formal comparisons. Of slopes and intercepts between the groups. And we also have a better estimate of the research Wolf Ariens. More degrees of freedom. Well here you find some possible models here is a model with a common intercept and a common slope here with the model with different intercepts. But. A common slope. Parallel lines. Here is a model with different intercepts and different slopes. And here is a model with a common intercept and different slopes. I would like to call this playing with slopes and intercepts and that's what we will discuss later on. OK. Second example. This is an example about birth weights of babies. And smoking of the mother. It's an observational study on two hundred thirty eight murders. So the dependent variable Y. is the birth weight. We have effect which represents the smoking of the mother the two possible levels either zero. Meaning that mother was not smoking or one. Meaning that the mother was smoking. This factor is numerically coded. This column. X. which is the generation of the pregnancy which is a quantitative regress. Here are they there for one hundred forty five nonsmoking murders. And here are the data for the ninety three. Smoking was added into the pot. Well the objectives of the study were to compare the birth weight for non smoking and smoking modest smoking harmful. Well for that. Objective you could do an ordinary T. test. We don't need any fancy stuff here. And yet and. The smoking may influence also the juror ation. And the duration. Will influence the birth weight as well and. You may be interested in the question about what is left of the smoking effect if we try to correct for duration. And we may also be interested in the really. With way too duration and compare. For nonsmoking and smoking mothers. For these objectives. We need. Real questions. And again. If we start with simple questions in the two separate. We can do the regression for the nonsmoking mothers this would be the result for the smoking mother's This would be to be so. But we would like to have both in one group. And maybe we're not happy with this model maybe we would prefer a model where the two. Slopes are the same. OK is the third example about peanut use. These are data from an experimental study in a greenhouse. Completely randomize the scientists used. With the treatment effect or type of fertilizer. Find it over here. The fertilizer. Factor as three levels. I did see. Which was a standardized standard fertilizer. Control. As a slow release fertiliser or af. A fast released. Fertilizer. And there were ten rep. Replicates the treatment. OK We also have and pondered that every vessel here. Which was the initial. Height of the plant at the start of the experiment and the Y. is the dependent variable here. We would like to explain. Here are the data for the for the peanut plant with standard fertilizer. But slowly release fertilizer and with a fast release fertiliser. In this case. The objective was to compare that peanut yields between the three fertilizes. Are the differences between fertilizers so Demain interest is in the treatment factor. And to bed get it. To get better comparisons it may be beneficial to correct. For the initial plant hide if you start with larger plants that maybe the yield is higher as well. So we would like to correct for. Plant hide. This will also reduce the research welfare. Leading to more precise comparisons between. The fertilizer levels. Well if you look into the scatter plot of the data we see roughly three parallel lines but if we would do simple repressions in the ship groups. We would get these three lines which not. Which are not exactly parallel. So probably but we would like a something like this where we force these lines to be parallel. And analysis with parallel lines like this is called an on call fine analysis of cofee Ariens. Now the last example. About fertilisation skills children. This is an observational study. Eighty children from four social economic classes at ages under six years. So we have a sector which is called as. The social economic class of the child. With four levels it's numerically coded with all use one two three or four. We have the quantitative reverse or. X. which is the H. and the Y. differ by the sation skills dependent variable. Here are the data from the four classes. Clause one two three and four. And again in this case the main interest is in defect in would like to study where the drug differences between the social economic losses with respect to the fabulous ation skills. Of the children. And to get a better comparison it may be beneficial to correct for D.H. of the child. If we would do simple regression see the ship groups we would get this rather messy. Picture. Probably would. Would like to fit a model like this where we have parallel lines again. And call for. This a disco now assist to compare levels of a treatment factor. Correcting. For one or more quantitative regresses using a model with their own lines. Is traditionally called analysis of cull ferrets. The quantitative regressive. Which be correct is called a CO ferry it. Nowadays the term analysis. Of course fer instance often used in a wider sense. Referring to Linear Models containing both Co ferry it's pointed that represses. And factus qualitative sponsor fables. In summary. We're looking here at. General linear models. In which we have a deep in a fair ball Y. which is written as a sum of a systematic part of a part in a systematic Park we have quantitatively Christus and all factors. And it's. Linear in the parameters. We have a set of assumptions for developed a normal distribution. Constant independent means zero. Linear Models comprise. Linear regression. I know far. And I'm all for models. Which do differ only in a systematic part. Unco find a narrow sense. Deals with the comparison of treatments. Correcting for cough areas using a parallel lines model and uncalled for in a wider sense. Deals with models with both factors and quantitative regress. A linear model may be written as the repression model. Using Demi fables. For effect to levels. And the theory. That was developed for the question. Can be used for linear models as well.

                "text": "Hello my name is Christian bomb. And in this knowledge clip. I will talk to you about the very. Muse developments implant by technology. And the newest developments. Really. Surround things like. Targeted mutation and. Genome editing. I'm going to take you through a few different techniques and then the up with for what may. For me it's the most exciting technique. So these include. O.D.M.. Zinc fingers talons and crisper cast nine. Now. That doesn't sound like much at the moment but I will explain them as we go along. O.D.M. all ego Mukul are tied mediated mutagenesis. Now. In all of your nucleotides. It is possible to synthesize and all again you could tide which has homology. To a target gene. But. Introduces a single base pair. Change. Shown this here. In conjunction with chloroplasts. Because chloroplast. Do indeed have a very good system for. Homologous free combination which allows all egos to be incorporated and. In the course of replication. Will allow the. Mutated base. To be incorporated into the genome. Now all of our nucleotide. Mutagenesis. Has not really found a very sound place it can be used maybe for chloroplast mutagenesis. But it's not. It can be used very well in terms of. Routine transformational. Genome editing. Now genome editing is a new concept and planned by technology. And it's really the introduction of D.N.A. sequences. And introducing. Specific new clip. Nucleotide changes. Now one of the ways that that can be. Don. Is to engineer. So the restriction enzymes so. Sequence specific. Cutting sites. In the genome which will then be repaired by the host system and introduce. Short. Deletions or short mutations. Now these can be targeted. To unique sites in the genome. One or indeed more. Sites but. Known sites of the genome. For that of course you need genome sequence knowledge. Now this. As I said. Making breaks in. Genomic sequences. Allows the. Non homologous enjoining. Of the sequences and because the host system specially in plants but also in animals. That is fairly. Imprecise. That usually can introduce short. Insertions or. Deletions into that particular site. Thereby knocking out the gene. In animal systems and possibly in future implant systems. We can actually. Also by homologous recombination introduce new sequences into that bright point. So let's see how that works in practice. Now the. Zinc finger knew clearly says. Proteins which have been engineered to have a sequence specificity. To specific sequences. In the genome. And these have been basically. Engineer it together with the restriction enzyme and enzyme which cuts the D.N.A.. So by engineering this portion of the. Protein that recognizes a specific sequence. You can. In a modular fashion. You can build up your own protein. To be specific. For a unique site in the genome. Of course. In that case it has to be quite a long sequence. And it's quite tedious. To build up your protein. But the zinc finger nuclear system. Is one that is used and introduces a break into the genome. Which is then. Repaired by the whole system. Now zinc finger. New clearances. Can be introduced. Can be used to introduce mutations as I said. But they can combined. By adding a template. So by homologous freek'n combination. Can insert a piece of D.N.A. into the target site so. If I just go over here to the board. We can see that. Such an engineered. Protein can be introduced by transformation. This will find its target. Can't break. The D.N.A.. At that point in the genome. And by introducing a gene of interest. Combined with some homology. To the breakpoints. It will introduce your. Gene of interest in. To that site. In the genome. However this. Only has been really shown to function in properly. In animal systems that. There is an instance and I expect there will be over the next years of being able to introduce a new piece of D.N.A.. Implant systems. But because of the lack of a very efficient homologous recombination system implants. It is difficult and quite rare. To get this introduction however. The introduction of. A simple mutation. By non homologous enjoining. Has been shown to be very efficient and. Work very well. A similar system. To the zinc finger new places are. The towel. Effect the new Clare's is or talons. These proteins are really just the same so they have a domain. Which can be engineered. To have specificity. For a unique site in the genome. The only difference two or the major difference to zing thing in new cases it's the Talons have their own nuclear uses endo new places. Which cut the D.N.A. eliminating the need to engineer. That part of the protein. They work in exactly the same way. They will introduce a double stranded break. In the D.N.A. which allows the host system. To repair that. By non homologous enjoining and. This introduces deletions. From between a few bases up to about fifty basis maximum. Now targeted mutation and genome editing well. There are problems. So. As I said already said the ol ego nucleotide directed mutagenesis. Is not very efficient. It's pretty much a hit and miss produce procedure and. Oh DMCE have not been found to work particularly well implants. Think fingers and talons. Do work implants quite efficiently. But they are difficult and genea. And the procedure is lengthy and therefore. Quite expensive. So now recently. There's been a real paradigm shift. There has been another system which is being introduced really. In the last couple of years and. This relies on a bacterial recombination system which initially evolved to fight. Faders or bacterial viruses. Now let me take you through how this works. Now first of all. I'm going to look at some of the terms that I'm going to be using. And just explain those for a quickly. And we'll come back to those in the detailed explanation. So what is crisp Ah well Christopher R. stands for clustered. Regularly in the. Bust. Short. Palindromic repeats what a mouthful. Will come back to what that actually means. In a moment in the cartoon. Cast is a protein. And that is a crisp. Associated protein nine. That's what we call a cast nine. Pam. What's that mean. Pam's our protest space adjacent at least again. A horrible mouthful. But I'll let you know exactly what that means. A bit later on the third term. Is the all important. S. G. R.N.A.. And that's a single guide R.N.A.. And then we have the track car nay. Which is the transacting clustered repeat. On air so this is all. These are all components of the crisper class nine system. And I'll show you on the board now. How these work in detail. So we talked of. Be clustered regularly. Interspersed short palindromic repeats Now these are repeated sequences. That are organized in little pile and drums. Repeated. In a portion of the bacterial genome. I see you can see there is a promoter on the front here. So this. Set of clustered regularly interspersed. Short palindromic repeats. Are transcribed. As a single on a track or are in a is then. Also a separate R.N.A.. That is transcribed which recognizes. These repeats. And will help. Together with our in Ace's and the cats nine protein. To make short. R.N.A. segments that derives from this. Crisp OS sequences these then recognize. They bind. To the cast nine protein. And they recognize the sequence of the fade. The bacterial virus. So the bacteria can then recognize this for an incoming D.N.A. and chop it up and make that. Virus that. Phage. As we call it. In active. So it's an immune system. For the bacterium. To fight off. These viruses that come in to try and destroy them. What scientists have found quite recently. Is that all you need. Is essentially the cast nine protein. Together with the single guide. R.N.A. sequence. What you can do and this denoted by this. Are where this red piece. Is if you engineer this red piece. To have homologous. To a unique gene. In your plant genome. This. Single Guy though and I will have it it's five prime and. A little piece of homology. To the place in the genome that you want to target. So that when your expression of cast line protein. It will bind. This. Single guide. R.N.A. and will direct cast nine. To that part of the genome. And that part of the genome. Will then be can't. At the target locus. Now this is what. Such an engineer. System would light look like. So here we have the S.G. R.N.A.. That's been engineered. In Green. And here we have the host genome which now carries the cast mind. Protein. Together with the bound. S G R N A. It has found its homology in the genome. And together with this planned. Sequence that I mentioned earlier. Which is just a short. Set of. Nucleotides. Essentially just a C.C. raised you. Which has to be in or around. Your targeting sequence. Cast nine will then break that sequence up. And allow the host system. To rip. Have at. Now what can we do. So we have a cost nine we have our target. Sequence which is double Pat we have our break. That is caused by the cast my new clear eyes. And we have a double stranded break of our D.N.A.. So on the one hand. The host system. By non homologous. Enjoining. Will introduce. Small deletions. Mutations which will knock out that gene. But in animal systems and hopefully eventually also implant systems. You can provide a piece of. Extra D.N.A. with homologous. To the terminal sites. Of your target. So that you can introduce a piece of music D.N.A. into your. Insertion site so these two procedures. Have been shown to work in animals. And to a limited extent implants. So what are the advantages of. Genome. Editing. Using crisper CAS nine Well it is extremely precise targeting. To one location or few locations throughout the genome. There is no foreign D.N.A. inserted. At the point of insertion. Or I but mutation site. It is quite rapid and. Efficient so that makes it cheap. And it potentially. Allows. Not only knockouts but also in session's of new sequences. The disadvantages. Well. There are very few that I can think off. What do you think. And above all. Let's see what the regulators think of this. Because regulation. Is no are not yet being developed for this technology. Is this technology. G.M.O.. Which means. Genetically mother. If I were I would argue yes of course it is. It is in fact. The best way of genetic modification. But. Is this a transgenic technology. Well in the beginning it's a transgenic technology. Because you insert the cast nine and the S.G.. R.N.A.. Into your plant. However it is. Then very simple. By doing a few courses. To segregate out your. Trans gene. From your mutation. Location. Because these will be in different parts of the genome. And therefore you will be able to get rid of the trends gene. In just a few crosses. So essentially the product that you're making is not. Transgenic. But it is a G.M.O.. So how will regulate this think about this. How do you think about this. What are the implications. Well let me just finish by a few conclusions and actually some open questions. Well genome editing. I'm convinced. Is going to be a really big thing. Not only implant. By technology. But also in animal by think Knology and in human health. Careful thought will have to be applied to this. And to its regulation. There are huge. Ethical implications. Especially for the human sector. We think of designer babies. Now the question opens up. Is this the holy grail is this the best technology and will this produce a contribution. To helping with food provision of food and prevention of starvation. I'll leave that up to you.\n",

                "text": "Hello my name's kissin bomb. And in this clip. I'm going to be talking about transformation technologies. Essentially. How to get a gene of interest. Into your plant. Let's go back a bit. And just consider the cells. That we want. As targets now here. I'm going to just go through a couple of points that. Differentiate plant cells from animal cells. As you can see both plants and animal cells have a very similar organization. We've got a cytoplasm. And a nucleus which is the same situation. In plant cells. And we have many other small. Organelles. In the cytoplasm. Which have all very different functions. And most of. Organelles. Are similar in plants and animals such as the Golgi apparatus. And many of us. Now. What I want to draw your attention to is a few unique features of plant cells. Plant cells for example have this rigid. Cell wall. Composed of cell or Lowes and lignin some other polysaccharides in polythene else. This cell wall. Means that. As opposed to the animal cell. A plant cell. Needs to have a structure whereas animals frequently have skeletons and. Get their rigidity. By an internal skeleton the plant. Gets its rigidity. Essentially by the cell walls. Now that also means if you want to get D.N.A. into cells. You have to get through this substantial barrier. Now Another unique feature of plant cells is the. Chloroplast. Now. Animal cells don't have chloroplast because they don't for to synthesize. Plants have these. Chloroplasts. Now. Let's go into the D.N.A. containing organ elsewhere of course the nucleus. As such. Contains the vast majority of D.N.A. in both plant and animal cells. And implant cells. However. We have additional. Genomes. So we have the nuclear genome as I said. We have the mitochondrial genome. Such as in plants. But the chloroplast genome. Also have has D.N.A. So when we're talking about getting genes into plants. Well. We have three different genomes which we could target. The unique plant. Organelle. The chloroplast. Is and the symbiote and that is. It is thought that. In the far distant past of evolution. Bacteria like. Organisms. Actually invaded plant cells. Where they then became part of the plant cell. Performing the task of capturing sunlight and energy to produce. To fix. Carbon and to produce sugars. For the plant. To use. Now. Equally. The mitochondrion. Is another and a symbiotic organelle. Which probably also started life as a separate organism which invaded. The cells. In this case both animals and plants. But it also contains D.N.A.. So the basic game of transformation. Is to set. And a desired gene. Somewhere into the genome. One of the three targets. In general you'd like to insert the. Single gene or at least few copies. Which will make life easier. Later on in terms of. The genetics. Of your particular trait. Now you want to insert your. Gene into a location. Which will favor expression. So we're come on to why that's and how that's important in a moment. Now you want to also in your desire gene with as little as possible extraneous D.N.A.. So you do not want. Bits of D.N.A. in your plant which is in addition to your specific gene. That you wanted to express. So let's just have a look at the anatomy of the chromosome. We're talking about genomic D.N.A. well. The D.N.A.. As we know is. Long very extremely long molecule. Composed of bases. With the backbone of. Sugars and. This in a normal situation. Becomes wrapped around. Histone proteins. As is shown in number one. Now these histone proteins. Fall together. Pack. Back together essentially and form. Long. Fibers. So. Into. You can see that these fibers. Are organized in loops. Extended loops. Which are actually open and. Usually open for expression. And the more packed region. Internally. Which is less accessible to the machinery which controls expression. So if we go on these extended. Fibers which are looped up and then further. Wrapped into. Extended fibers and these are wrapped fibers. Then. Form. The whole chromosome. Now the chromosome. Is has also some specific features. We have the teal Amir's. On the ends of the chromosome which are very important in terms of. The replication. We have the central region where the two sister chromatism in a deployed organism are she joined together which. For the central male. And this is their proteins that are associated with that extra proteins and. We have this. Deployed organism these two. Daughter chroma to organize next to each other. Now for. Plant transformation methods. We can differentiate between bio take and. Abiotic. Transformation systems. So let's start off with the. Abiotic. Transformation systems. Well. I have shown here. On the board. A gun. That symbolizes. Particle transformation. Here we take particles coat them with D.N.A. and shoot these particles. Into cells. This is a method which has been already developed for quite some time and. Is a very physical way of getting D.N.A. into cells. Another physical way. Is using electricity. Here with this. Lightning. Stroke I indicate. Electra peroration So this is by D. polarizing the membrane. With an electric impulse. You can also get D.N.A.. To get into the cell. Another physical method is actually a chemical method by using particular chemicals. To soluble lies the cell walls and punch holes in them basically. You can also get D.N.A.. Inside the cell. And that D.N.A. is then. Incorporated into the chromosome of D.N.A. a technique that was used a long time ago not so much used any. All. In and plant systems but still an animal system. Is my current direction. And that's the system by which you can inject the nucleus. With a particular type of D.N.A.. So those are the a bot ik systems of transformation. Those are added to by the by all tick systems. I've shown this here is a bacterium. Will come to that in another clip where we showed that there are certain bacteria. For example I go back to him to the fashions. Which has a very unique and very sophisticated way. Of inserting D.N.A. into the nucleus of the plant. But viruses. Can also do this job. And so. Viruses is the second. Possible. System for. Inserting D.N.A. into plant genomes. Now there are advantages and disadvantages of these two techniques. A buttocks systems. Can be extremely useful for science and. If we want to just look at what a particular construct will do. We can use a transient expression system. Just to transform specific cells and to see what that gene will do in that system. It can mean there are also. These A about the techniques can be very useful for recalcitrant trops crops which cannot well. Be transformed well by I go back to them or other. Biotech systems. There are downsides. Problems. Of copy number. So the. Aerobatic systems tend to give you an extremely high copy number of insertions. And these. Insertions. Can also be kind Maris and rearrangements. So we often have problems. Of the way that the D.N.A. is inserted. With these aerobatic systems. But I think transformation. Using our bacterium for example. Can give us. High frequency of. Single copy and sessions that. Because of the. Sophisticated technique that agro bacterium uses. To get the D.N.A. and. We often find just one copy inserted. It's also extremely efficient. So you get a high number of transformations. Explant that your. Transforming with. However there is always the problem of getting some extraneous D.N.A.. Incorporated into your genome. Because agro bacterium uses specific sequences to help get the D.N.A. and. These sequences. Remain in your plant genome. Although they are essentially of bacterial origin. Furthermore it is quite complicated. To manipulate agro bacterium. To get your gene and. And so cloning procedures. By chemical procedures. To get that D.N.A. and are a little bit more difficult. So the conclusions I want to leave you with. Is For a start the genome is big it's huge and. Getting your favorite gene. Into a good position for. Expression. Can be difficult. Genomic realestate is all about location location location so where you have your D.N.A. will determine. Pretty much how well it will be expressed. Now the insertion site. Of your trans gene. Will indeed then. Have a huge effect on the expression of your trait. Get it in the wrong place. And it will be snowed on and disappear. Get it in the right place. And it will express well on the express. Of a many generations.",

                "text": "Hello my name's Kristen bomb and. Did In this clip. I'm going to be talking about. In Hans Singh genetic variation. And we'll talk a little bit about. In particular mutagenesis a mutagenesis breeding. Now variation genetic variation. Is fundamental to all plant breeding. Variation. Depends on mutations. And subsequent selection. Now some plants which are. Vegetatively propagated much higher. May have much less variation. Than the crop. That is sexually propagated by seeds. So there is. Differences in the amount of variation that you find in different plants. Now mutation frequencies. Are also different and. Occur due to natural circumstances. Mutations. Usually have a negative effect on a gene a mutation will cause a knock out of a gene and. It is very rare that a mutation will enhance the activity of a gene. However you can consider that a knockout. Could be of advantage. If you have a product that you want to produce more of. Then having a gene knockout. In the end Zein that degrades that product. Might enhance its production. So. Knockouts can be advantageous. Down natural mutations occur in in the genome. By for example replication heiress. That is that during the. Replication of D.N.A. errors a made and mutations. There by a car. But you also have. Jumping genes called transposable elements which can also cause mutations and to rock. Disrupt genes and their function. Now new. Taishan in. Organisms and specially in higher organism. A counteracted by. Extremely sophisticated D.N.A. repair systems. In combination with replication replication. Errors. Normally result in. Indels what we call in the elves that is insertions. And or deletions. And these can produce also sequence repeat itself we have a look at a chromosome a level. What can occur. As a natural mutation while. Bits of the chromosome. Can break off and disappear. But bits of the chromosome can break off and then. Be reattached. In the opposite. Orientation. And we call that inversions or. Bits of chromosomes can fall off. And be reattached. To a different chromosome. And we told that translocations. Song. On the chromosome a level on the markers. Large scale level. Various different types of mutations that car. At a D.N.A. level. Normally we get. Small areas. And we call those. Single nucleotide polymorphisms. Where a single base. Will be changed. Sometimes you get an insertion of single very short. Base. Residues in a piece of D.N.A.. You get also repeated regions. Often by improper. Replication of the D.N.A. and this can lead to directed repeats. Or indeed they're inverted repeats. So the majority of natural mutations are. Single base pair substitutions. Other mutations. As I said in kid. In include these in the elves but the majority of our substitutions. And the majority of these substitutions. Tend to be. C G. To eighty changes. Which we call transitions. And the probable causes are. The D.M. a nation. Of methylated cited scenes. Which then. During replication of course this transition to a different base. These sorts of mutations. Can often even be caused by. Ultraviolet light. Now in a study by Detlef Uyghurs group. It was shown that in our belt system the very very long term experiment. Planting out in the field populations of our But upsets over a long period. And each time sequencing the genome. What was found was that. Mutations to car naturally. At a particular frequency. And that these mutations. A fairly randomly distributed throughout the genome. Now. In my opinion. This doesn't look quite random. But I think. In the longer term. Mutagenesis natural mutagenesis tends to be fairly random although there may be hotspots. Now what. Are mutagenic. Agents. There's lots we know about X. rays or gamma rays. Can be of cosmic or terrestrial origin. These are. Ionizing radiation. Which can disrupt the N.A. and. Cause mutations. We also have alpha and beta radiation that tends not to be outside but it requires incorporation of. Isotopes which then produce this Alpha will be the radiation which then cause in the cell. Different forms of. Of mutation. But as I said previously. Even U.V. light. Can cause mutations. There are other classes. Such as chemical. Mutagens. And there are many causes of these mutagens. Most of them involve. Into collating. Between the D.N.A. and causing replication Arris but sometimes we can also have chemical changes. Like the compound. E.M.'s and I'll go into E.M.'s. Because that's. Used as a mutagenic in. Mutagenesis. But then we have. As I said at the beginning transposable. Elements that are jumping genes which create. Enzymes which cause a particular segment of the N.A. to be introduced at various places throughout the genome. And can also cause me tensions. Now. Ion izing radiation. Tends to cause. Small deletions. And insertions of other places. And it can all. So Cause whole chromosome breaks or inversions. Or translocations as as we saw earlier. Chemical mutagenesis. E.M.'s their course is a specific. Transition from A to G.. And from C. to T.. And that is very particular and so if you want to use a mutant a chemical mutagenesis program. In breeding. Then you would have to consider the type of mutations that you would get. And the effects of those types of mutations. Transportable elements. Tend to cause disruption of genes by. Integration and. Breakage of the gene. We will later stage in another clip. Also. Think about methods. That will introduce into. Directed mutagenesis. By some kind of. Recombination. Mutagenesis breeding. Inevitably involves the induction. Of a large number of mutations. Throughout the genome. Rather than introduce a specific mutation at one point. Mutagenesis breeding. You will mutagenesis the whole genome. Introduce many many. And then have to select out. Your desired mutations. By a process. Of basically. Crossing. And breeding. This is. Takes a long time and. It is a difficult process. But it may be one of the very few alternatives. For in Hansing variation in crops that. In themselves. Not very amenable to classical. Breeding technologies. This includes for example banana. That is a very difficult species to actually breed with. Because it is vegetatively propagated and. It is not five times. Also in ornamentals mutagenesis breeding has been very successful. Because it can be a. It can produce. Changes that you might want to have. And it's been used a lot. In many areas throughout the past years. Mutagenesis breeding has been successfully applied. For example in M.S. breeding in the Breske a share. Gamma irradiation. Of Rights. But also chemical and other types of. Mutagenesis has been used in flax and sunflower apple pear great Pruett. And pineapple. So it is still a method that is quite widely used. Now. Go into the M.S. protocol for. E.M.'s mutagenesis. That depends a lot on the crop that you're using some crops can stand up to a higher concentration of B.M.S.. And other crops. We will usually use. Seed. To mutagenesis. For mutagenesis. To put the seeds in a solution of. E.M.'s I mutagenesis mutagenesis. Seeds but pollen could also be used as a target for mutagenesis. As could possibly callous. E.M.'s. Functions. By adding methanol group. To the G.E. resit you. As is shown here on the board. Then during replication. That G.E. rested you. That with use methylated. Will pair with a T.V. resit you. And then during. Further replication. That location which was originally a C. becomes a T. Paired with an ad. So we have a transition from the G.C. pair. To it. A path. Now seeds. Would normally be mutagenesis as seen in this. Protocol and. The products of that initial. Mutagenesis a called the. M one population of the first mutant United population. From those. Single seeds can be isolated. And you get families. Seed lots. From those individual plants. Which then. Represent the MTU. And you can go on and phenotype those and. See in the end. Too. And the end three. What the effects of your music Genesis. Has been. Now the vantages. Of mutagenesis breeding is that it's basically a random mutagenesis and makes. Areas of the genome and particular genes accessible. That may not be accessible via. Normal breeding processes. It can be the best of only a very few options that you have in a certain crop. And it can create variation. That isn't possible to find in nature. Another important. Advantage which I haven't put up there. Is that it is not the normal. G.M.O. type break elation. So it is considered that. Mutagens and. Products produced from mutagenesis breeding. Are not. G.M. mouse. Some of the disadvantages well. It requires a lot of time. Because you've got to get rid of the. Background of unwanted. Mutations that you've induced in your random mutagenesis process. To isolate only the the desired. Muted mutation that you have produced. It's random nature makes it of course impossible to steer. And the background the facts. May be. Also extremely difficult to avoid So if you have a desired mutation close to a non decide mutation. It may be very difficult. To segregate those out by further breeding. So the conclusions I want to leave you with mutation. Is that the heart of variation in plants. There are natural mutations which help. Plants to evolve but this is a very very slow process. Mutation induction. By chemicals or by irradiation. Can make that a more rapid process and increase variation. But the random nature. Of mutagenesis. Means that there are many steps. Of breeding that are required. After you have achieved your mutagenesis.",

                "text": "Hello my name is Christian bomb and. In this clip. We'll be talking about the principles of pathway engineering. As a part of plan by technology. So one hour by chemical pathways. Well we've probably all. Have some idea. But let's just take a look on the board here. At this wonderful chart. Which is all. The by chemical pathways. In most living organisms. But it has to be said that this is a very small a very brief summary. In fact. Things are much more complicated than. Is shown here. I know already. From this chart that. The Krebs cycle is located here. All the hormone. By synthesis. Is located here. And the glycolysis. Is sort of. In this area. But of course this is far too complicated so let's just to have a look. Where is glycolysis. Well. This stretch. Is what we call glycolysis. This is the process by which. Sugar has broken down and. Energy is produced. For the cells use. Now this first part is actually a part of glycolysis. That works and. Is present in. Chloroplasts of plants. The second part is primarily a cuz. In the cytoplasm. Of cells. Whereas this last part the Krebs cycle. Is mainly in mitochondria. So we have to know when we're doing engineering of pathways. Where and when individual. Pathways are actually functioning. Else we won't be able to change anything. So what are the components. The major components of a biochemical pathways well. We always start out with one particular molecule and. We end with some metabolite. Some other molecule that has been changed. Either being cut in half or. Changed in some other way. We often have co-factors. We have the. Enzymes which are the biological catalog catalyzes which catalyzed the reactions. And we have various types of regulators. So let's draw that in a big scheme. We have a starting metabolite. We have an enzyme. Encoded by a gene. And we end up with a metabolite B. and often in this case. Either. A.T.P. the. Energy provider of the cell. Is used up or. On occasions. Is produced. And we have other. Ions which can act as co-factors. Which can. In Hans. The reaction. To produce that matter blood be. So in a whole pathway. You will of course have several of these and zines several. Metabolites. And several genes that code for the enzymes that. Are catalyzing the separate reactions. Here. We've got. Metabolite. A B. C. and D.. So let's consider how we want to change this. How we would possibly produce more. Of metabolites. See which is here. Which is a product of enzyme to encoded by Gene two and then that met a blind. Which is a precursor for C. is produced from at sublight. A By enzyme to encode. And someone coded by Gene one. So the simplest method. May be. Just to produce more. Of enzyme too fat. Will hopefully lead to more. Of metabolite see. So increasing the expression of this particular gene. We hope. Might produce more. Of enzyme to. Which then. Will produce more. Of metabolite C. Now you could consider knocking down. And signed three. This latter enzyme which actually degrades metabolite C to produce Dean. By knocking this sense on out. You maybe. Will accumulate more of product C.. So that's an alternative. We've seen that. Producing more and slime too. Might produce more seen. But by stopping the degradation reaction. You may also get more see. You can also rather than change the. Gene expression. You could also find another way. Of inhibiting the enzyme at a protein level. By producing some factor. Which actually inhibits the protein. The enzyme three. Which may also give rise to more. Product seen. On a gene expression level. You can. We know that there are transcription factors. These are. Proteins that regulate gene expression. And sometimes transcription factors. Will influence. A whole pathway so not only a single gene. But the whole pathway. And by manipulating all over expressing this transcription factor that. Up. Regulates. These particular genes. And therefore produces more of these particular enzymes. You may also get more products in. So you can also. Attempt to change the level of. Transco. In fact those. That will overall increase. This through flow. Of this route. And produce more. Product see. However in some cases there are instances where you have end product. Inhibition. Of a particular enzyme. And that should always be taken into account. So regulation. Of how the whole pathway works. And how the Mets headlights. Act on these different enzymes isn't also a important issue to take into account. In this case. If we want more C. Maybe we can produce. And then Xyrem which degrades metal blight. D.. And therefore stops. That inhibition and thereby. Get more product see. These are all cases that have been exercised and that have been carried out. To produce a particular method bill and knowing about this metabolic pathway. Is very important. In order to produce more C. Frequently inevitably. Metabolic pathways are more complicated. And they have branches. This is the case in a branch pathway. Where by stopping the introduction into this second branch pathway of c prime. And the prime production by. Inhibiting this enzyme. That is that the pathway between at the break point between these two pathways. You also possibly redirect the pathway towards C. and D.. Thereby hopefully getting more of D.. Now all these combinations. All these possibilities that I've just. Elucidated to you may. Occur. And so combinations of these approaches are also. Imaginable. And as an exercise that you will be shown. You maybe can go through some of the feasible combinations of these different possibilities of engineering metabolic pathways that I've described. Could be applied to certain instances in practice. Now let's just look at one particular case. Now. This is a complicated pathway a branch pathway again. That gives rise to a series of metabolites. Called Karata noids. And these Karata nights. Are important for the color of. For example a tomato plant. But also of other plants products. So here we have several genes that. As I was showing you previously codes for enzymes that catalyze different steps towards the production of. This lycopene. Actually a red product. In a plant. Carotene. Is an orange product and. You have a split in the pathway and. You have various other Karata noids which also have different colors. So in this pathway. You can imagine. Many of the possibilities. That I spoke to at the beginning of the clip about. That would open up the possibility for manipulating this pathway. So in order to get. Brightly colored. Different colored tomatoes. You may think of different steps in this pathway that you might want to upgrade your late. Or inhibit. So changing fruit color. We might want to have white green pink yellow orange purple or black. Fruit. They might be interesting for the consumer. White plants white. Tomatoes. In fact. Could be produced by. Inhibiting Flight three in the red colored. Compound. And that can be produced by knocking out the fight to wean. One gene and. You would get. White plants. Green Tomatoes you might get by increasing the level of chlorophyll. But above all also maintaining that chlorophyll content. During ripening. So there you might consider an altered. Writing process which stops. The degradation of. Chlorophyll during ripening process which is what happens normally. You could think of a pink color. By slightly. Altering the expression of. The fight to incent a stream. You could get a yellow. Tomato by increasing. Compounds that are yellow and. By inhibiting. The very dark red color. Of the lycopene. You could think about increasing its orange color. By producing more Karata noids. More carotene beta carotene. You can think of purple. Plants by increasing the synthesis of the purple. Pigment anthocyanin. And again. You could think of a black. Tomato by increasing. Anthocyanins and increasing chlorophyll. So mixing that. Purple and green color. To get an almost black tomato. So in conclusion. What I want to leave you with is. The idea that. Of course. Metabolic pathways are complex. And that we can think of various different approaches to modulate. Those pathways and increase. A particular. Product or a set of products. Now. A lot of these approaches have been shown to work. But they don't always work. So it has to be experimented with. We do know a lot. But frequently. We do not know enough. But it's important to find out as much as we can about a biochemical pathway. Before trying to manipulate.",

                "text": "Hello my name's Christian bomb. And in this clip. I'm going to talk to you. A bit about why technology and what is and what is not planned by technology. So let's think about some definitions of technology and for that I've introduced a few. Definitions that I found in the curious. Webster direction. Dictionary defines by technology as the manipulation of living organisms. To produce usual. Useful commercial products. The Cambridge University Press. Suggests that it's exploitation of biological processes. For industrial and. Other purposes. The Oxford University. Dictionary. Suggests that it's the use of living organisms. For industrial processes so here we have a connection between living processes. And industrial process. And industrial products basically. So what is by technology. Now. This is a lovely Case in point. Maybe you'd say. Is this plant by technology here we have a farmer with a gigantic potato. Well. Now. This is actually Photoshop. So someone has been clever enough to manipulate a picture of a potato. And put it next to a farmer. This is not by technology. Is this plant by technology we have a huge pumpkin. This has to be planted by a technology. Actually it isn't. Is just good horticulture Pumpkin's naturally grow this big. And if you treat them properly. Then you will get such huge pumpkins. This is an interesting case. We have a black or very deep purple tomato. Is this plant by technology. Actually no it's breeding. But it could be a plant by technology. Because we could. Engineer a tomato. To produce this particular pigment. And produce. Black tomatoes. There is another case. Maize fairly normal looking Mises this problem by technology. In fact. Yes it is. But it can't be seen from the outside that this is planned by technology. This may strain. Is expressing a protein. Which is toxic to the larvae. Of Lepidoptera. Insects and. It is therefore resistant against. Particular pests. In maize and. It is produced by transforming the maize planned. With a gene that codes for this particular protein. So yes. Despite the fact that it looks normal. This is a plant by technology. So what are the targets generally well. As I've suggested. Stress. Resistance to either. A Bartik stress or biting stress such as disease. We can manipulate. By introducing new genes. We can change the quality aspects. You could imagine. Producing more vitamin C. in potato or. More Karata noid. More vitamin A in tomato. So these are quality aspects. Or just more starch in protective. So we can also manipulate growth characteristics by Palm by technology. Make the plant. Larger. Make it more bushy make it indeterminate in its growth. But there are also technological traits that we can to address. Like suitability for processing. Tomatoes for example a process to produce catch up. And you could imagine making new traits that. Increase the suitability for processing. Also content traits. But we also have novel products that we could produce that are normally not produced in that particular species. So what kind of science is involved in. Plant by technology will address this in another clip. But in general I think I'd like to. Plant molecular biology as being an important sciences part of part by technology. Looking at the genes. And looking at their regulation. Genetics is also important. The genes. And their inheritance. By a chemistry. That is the products that you're producing. And the enzymes that. Produce those products and the reactions that lead to these products. Of course physiology is also very important. What is the plant's response to the environment and how does that work. But there are many other fields. That link in that overlap with plant by technology such as Palm pathology and I grant. I'M GOING TO ME AND. Entomology and many others. So these are all science areas that you've got to bear in mind when you are approaching a plant by technology. What are the advantages of farm particular gene. Well I think. There are many. But one of the big advantages of pomp I think Knology. Is that you can introduce. Traits novel traits. More rapidly than you can. With traditional techniques such as breeding. You can introduce. Agro nomic traits that are not achievable by traditional methods of crossing. So you can take a trait that you would normally find in a different plant. And introduce it to a plant where you normally wouldn't find it. And where you couldn't do the crosses. In order to produce that particular trait. You can also in. Produce entirely novel products and in plants. These would be for industrial processes you could think of making pharmaceuticals implants. As such as antibodies. Or other chemicals and. You can introduce nutraceuticals that is. Products which are basically. On the borderline between new trends and pharmaceuticals. And there's a. Relatively low. Ethical impact. Or is that that's a big question that's a question of a lot of debate. What is the ethical impact. Of manipulating plants. Plants or not sent in beings. So we have no direct. Ethical Issues. As you would have in human beings. But. You may argue that there is an ethical impact. So what is. What are the disadvantages. Well. The regulatory framework in most countries. Is fairly stringent. And it was becoming ever more stringent in many countries. Will go into that in a bit more detail in a different clip. We do have a higher input. Required for Pampa. Technology it is expensive to do this science. And to generate those plans costs a lot of money. And because agriculture in general has quite low profit margins. It is quite difficult to achieve. The output from a plant by technology product. That will be able to give you the money back on your investment in the research. There are possible hazards and that must not be underestimated. To can. That may be introduced by introducing a novel trait and the much care has to be taken about that. And there is this general area. Of public acceptance. Certainly in Europe. And in many countries throughout the world. There is a worry about biotechnology and planned by technological products. These are things we eat. We regard what we eat. As normally. Something which should be natural. And some people consider. Plant By think Knology product as being something unnatural. So what are the solutions to these issues where information and transparency in education. Is probably. Of the three most important factors. We do have to do good science. And if you want to be a get involved in and plan by technology. The science that you do. Has to be. Above all possibility of error and it has to be done with great care. Model experiments can be useful. And there's a the whole story of golden rice which will go into again as part of the course. And these are. Experiments where people can try and produce something that is shown to be of benefit. And indeed consumer benefit. Is very important. So you've got to prove in order for people to buy these products. They have got to feel that there is a benefit that benefit can be in price. But it should also be. It could also be an environmental benefit or. A general benefit to the community. And there may be more solutions to this. To these worries and. To the other disadvantages. I'd like to discuss this with you and we will have a debate. I will have a debate with another colleague. As part of the course and. I'd like you to debate these things why is public acceptance level. Are they the public. Just not educated enough. Can we learn lessons from the past. How other technologies have been introduced. And above all who should get involved in this now my argument is that everybody should be involved. But especially you. As students. Of plant breeding and plant by technology. So just have a look at that decision making process. Concerning plant biotechnology. Well usually. Planned by technology is. Started by some kind of scientific investigation. And from that. Ideas come out for. Products and. And the advice is given to the legislators. Legislation is produce. And some form of regulation. Then. Ensues. Now who's doing that well. Universities. Institutes independent institutes and industry. Generally the people who are involved in the same scientific investigation. Governments. Do the legislation. And other organizations. Separate from. Government. We call them quiet goes whole quasar autonomous. Non-governmental organizations to coin a long phrase so independent organizations usually regulate. And then. Enforce that legislation. But who is doing the advice. Well. Scientific community. Obviously gives advice. To government. I would give advice to a minister about a new technology. But industry is also in there giving their advice. As are non-governmental organizations or N.G.O.s such as Greenpeace they will be giving their advice. In Europe. The commission or. In. In other areas. The. The government organizations will be giving their advice and. The media will also be involved. By producing information. That everybody will read. And that. Then will form a public opinion that the legislators the politicians will of course. Need to listen to very carefully. So just to round up a plan by technology is an applied discipline involving. Many scientific. Different disciplines subdisciplines. There are many actors involved and more so than in other areas of science. Implant by technology. It's important to know about these actors. And to know who is involved. Regulation. And acceptance of vital components. But above all. Your role is important. And in the course of this. Course. We hope that you will gain understanding. So that you will be able to really provide input. In plant biotechnology and in the whole process around it.",

                "text": "Hello and welcome to plant. By technology. In this presentation. I'm going to give you a short introduction to the Course as a whole and to the activities that you'll be doing. During the course. Well first of all and introduce myself my name stop because their mom. I was actually born in Mexico. And I grew up in the U.K.. I came to study in agriculture in Germany at Bonn University. And I went on to do my Ph D. at the much Planck Institute in Cologne. After that I did a post-doc in Edinburgh. And I went on to join a plan by a tech company here in Holland. And after a few years. I moved to the University of Maine where I've been now for about twenty years. As a teacher and research. Implant biotechnology. So just to come to the activities of this course. In terms of content. We're going to start the very small scale. At the micro scale. Looking at plant genomes. And how they are organized. And then zooming in on to the genes that are part of the genome. And looking at how those genes are expressed and how they're regulated. And then we'll go for a short introduction into the. Oh makes what we call the arm aches which is the. Overview of all genes. How they are expressed in transcript omics. How the proteins organized in proteomics. And how the metabolites that they produce. Are organized in metabolic mix. From there we'll go back to. Tissue culture where descried tissue culture. And why that is important for plant by technology. And how regeneration of plants from a single cell or. Maybe an organ. Is important for a plant by thick Knology. We will be looking at different ways. To modify plants and one of the important. Ways to do that is using a bacterium called. Agro backed him to move facials we will describe that. And we will describe how the vectors. D.N.A. parts in the. Bacterium have been developed in order to genetically modify plants. Then we'll look at give you an overview of the strategies for crop improvement. That's dealt with in more detail in the said. Book that we're giving to you. Which is called Plan biotechnology. So we'll cover that. Superficially also. That will be covered in other modules. Within this course. And then we will go into the brand new methods of plump I think Knology. And each year. I try to give you the cutting edge technology is the. Currently being developed. And so you get an insight of what is happening on the research level. And then we'll go over to talking about plant. By technology. In the context of society or. Society in general. That is the regulatory aspects of plant biotechnology. But also the perception of. Plant biotechnology and how both. Risks can be assessed. And how they're perceived. Let's say by the consumer. Now in terms of activities. Well. You'll be reading. The assigned chapters. For every part in the book. You will be watching these knowledge clips. Where we will try to summarize and give you extra information. You will also work on online. Assignments. Small exercises that you can do online to check yourself whether you've understood what we're trying to give to you and you'll be doing. Peer to Peer. Discussions and. Interactions to help each other to understand what. This is all about. Now in addition to that. We're planning. You. To do an assignment assignment which will run throughout the course. And for that he will prepare a presentation which will be shown here involving him. When you come to visit and. Will be assessed by your peers. But also you will write a written report on that assignment. Which will be about fifteen pages of. A report that you will hand in for us. Then also when you come you will be. Debating plant technology in a in the context both of. Generally of society. But also in your cultural context. Because that may be very different depending on where you are in the world. So. To round up the plant by technology is a very diverse discipline. It covers many individual subdisciplines. Such as by chemistry. Genetics. Agriculture. But also. Molecular Biology. So it's a very diverse subject. And what we want to do is we want to give you the information so that you can understand. Plant by technology from Gene. To the farm scale. And from farm to the whole society.",

                "text": "Hello my name is Christian bomb. And in this introductory. Presentation I'm just going to tell you about an assignment. That you'll be doing. Or be carrying out throughout the whole module. Plan by technology and. I'm going to tell you a little bit about what this is we're calling it the Grand Challenge. And what does that mean. That means that you are going to try to produce a plant. By a technology product. Now you'll be using different bits of information that will be given to you throughout the course. But you also be looking up. You would be doing your own research and looking at papers and in. Gathering information from the Internet. About your particular challenge that you will set yourself. So in the context. The situation we've sort of thought of for you is that you have been given a budget. Let's say about three and a half million euros or dollars. And you've been tossed by let's say a company. To develop a new product. Using plant by technology. Now what we've said is that this product should involve tomato. You probably all know tomato it's a member of the salination family. It's used in vegetables and snacks but it's also processed and used for. Soups and catch up. And lots of so it's a very diverse. Potential product. And we want you to think of a new product. That involves a plan by technology and. The tomato. As a product. So you can think of many different products. As long as they involve. Tomato. And as long as they involve biotech methods. So what should this product before well. That's up to you. It could be for the consumer. Such as making a more tasty tomorrow. So. Giving it a novel color. A different shape. But there are many other examples you could think of. So it could be also directed at the industry so. Making a tomato that is more amenable to processing. As catch up or. Soup as something else. Or it could give it. Extra shelf life. So that the industry can keep tomatoes for longer. And then you can think of totally novel markets. You can try and make a tomato which is got a nose on it or you can try and make a tomato. Which produces a plastic or. Another novel compound or. Think of a tomato that will project help you to produce ethanol. A lot of these things are probably nonsense. But I think what you need to do is think of some. Possible applications. With the use of biotech and tomato. And then try and see how you can organize that and plan. And write a proposal about how you want to achieve that product. So the stages. We have set a number of stages in this challenge. First of all. You can just have a brainstorm and think about all the different products. You can. And you will be working groups where we will assign groups. And you will be working in these groups and so you can discuss amongst yourselves. What products. You have maybe come up with. Then you have to decide on one. You've got to organize your team. I would suggest there should be a team leader. And then. That team leader can delegate different tasks. In writing that project. To the different team members. Then you can. You will have to sort out. And plan. The stages. That you need to undergo. Produce your product. You will be writing a draft project plan which we will go through together and. We can assess the feasibility. And I can maybe or. Other people can maybe point you in new directions. And you finalize your project plan. And at the end. You also make a presentation. Powerpoint presentation which. When you come to running in will be presented to your colleagues and. They will also be assessing whether it's a good presentation. And it's a good product. And they will give your marks for that. So as a round up. I want you to create a new product. Based on tomato. And I want to you to use. Creativity and inventiveness in thinking up. How to not only on the product. But. How to achieve that product using power by technology. So it's no good thinking of putting a nose. On a tomato. If you can't achieve that. Using some by technological means. And in the process. We will learn. We will discuss we will plan. You will delegate. And in the end you will present. Your new product. To your peers. Here inviting.",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this clip where I'm going to explain you about glossary assignment in this course you're going to learn a lot of difference virtual topics. Concepts. And this is just a few of them. So you can imagine that it's going to be quite difficult to remember all the different words. Concepts. And also understand and remember the differences between them. So that's why we have these signs. And assignments called the glossary assignment. And we hope that we help you with this is Simon's to better remember all the different topics. The assignment looks like this is just an overview a table. With all the different topics that are most difficult. So we have not included all the topics of the course. But especially the ones that are a bit difficult to remember or to understand. Differences between. And what you're going to do is to complete this. Glossary with. Twenty four different concepts. Throughout the whole course. So you have. Yeah you can take to four weeks. To do it. So what you do you complete the table. First you get the definition of the concepts. Then you give a definition in your own words or you give an example to make sure that you really understand. The topic. Then you provide. Synonyms. There are quite some. Were tour concepts that. Have different names. Different researchers. Can use different. Definitions for example. So. Provide synonyms. If you come across them. Then if a political. Includes. How to calculate. For example. Measure how to calculate an incidence rate. Then the units. Is it a percentage. Or is it a number. Etc so you include that there. And then we have included some additional questions which are mainly about comparing one concept. With another. And you give an answer there. And then finally we have the column of a rather common sense and you can put there your own questions or your own remarks. For the specific concept. So for all the difference. Concepts you can use such as a resource Yes. The book of weapon then has a hole over a few. We've provided the link for that but also to World Health Organization. Also has a lot of. Definitions that you could use. In addition to this list of twenty four. Compulsory. Words You can also add your own words to make it also your own glossary. Because in the next courses. You may come across the same concepts again. And then you have your own glossary. That you can use as a reference. Documents. To see what is meant. Well what you're going to do is. After each week. At least that's my suggestion that you complete your glossary individually. Then you share it with one. Other students and compare whether definition is correct or not. So you can also learn from each other then the third step is to improve the. Glossary. If necessary. And finally you submit. The final glossary. With all the compulsory. Items at the end of this course. So a week five. You will submit a completed. Table. What we have also developed is a mind map to also support you in making the. Glossary as it is for example in week one. There is a number. Of topics. Concepts that are explained. And we have put that in a large. Mind Map and each week. You will get the over a few of the topics that are discussed in that particular week. So it's just something. A tool that you can use. It's where it's your own choice. OK so. I've explained you in this clip. That's the glossaries time and it's completed throughout the whole course. It's an individual projects but you can get feedback from. Another students. In your course. It will also be a resource for subsequent. Courses. And the mind maps are a tool that can help you with making the glossary.",

                "text": "Hello. Welcome to this clip. About Health Policy assignments. I'm going to explain to you what the assignment. Will look like and all the steps that you have to take. When completing the assignment in this course. I will start by explaining you some. Learning objectives. First learning objective is to remember and understand the different measures in the scripts if you believe me on a G.M. public health Hugh learning this course. And also to apply these measures. To a number of diseases. For example cancer. Cardiovascular diseases diabetes etc. And finally an objective. Or outcome of this. Course is that you understand how to use these states or to develop health policies. For a specific country. OK. The aim of the assignment is in your country. You're going to select one country. The Ministry of Health is going to prepare a health policy. Starting from two thousand and sixteen to two thousand and twenty. And it's of course it's an imaginary health policy. And the you are asked as and. You put in your interests. So provide some lucking data. So to minister is asking your inputs to provide some gaps in there in his information. Or her information. And here you see. Four different steps that you're going to do. In the assignment. The output of the assignment. Is that in the end you're going to make a presentation. And it's only a Power Point presentation you're only going to provide slides in a Powerpoint presentation. And if you like for the skills building. You can also use this opportunity to do. An actual presentation. But I'm going to leave that out. From this. Instruction for now. So your outputs. Is just a power point. Documents with a lot of information. But first you will start with the selection of a country and this country can be your country of birth. It's going to be the country where you currently live. Or maybe another country to here are interested in. So select one country. And then. For this country you're going to collect a lot of information. In total there will be eight topics. Throughout the whole course. That you're going to work on. And I'm going to give some. Illustration of how do whole assignment works with the first. Sub Simons the first topics. Topic which is. Diabetes preference. So you're going to collect data on diabetes prevalence. For your own. Select it's country. So this is an example of. Watch the assignment looks like your first collects information about your own country. For example look at a website with information about diabetes and find the prevalence for a number of years. And the second part of this is Simon is that you're going to compare with the other students. In your small group. But that's I will later on. Explain how to do it. OK so if we have this example. Of diabetes prevalence. You make a Power Point slides. You provides the day sat for example what if the diabetes prevalence in two thousand and fourteen and. You give a narrative. Explanation. In the notes section in your Powerpoint I will show you an example. So it can look like this. This is an example from Germany. You provide the data for three different years. Part of this assignment. And then. In the notes section. You give some explanation. Why the rates are like that. Why the prevalence. Is first going down then going up. So there is a number of questions and you answer them. In the notes section. So this is what it will look like. When you have done that in a Power Point. Documents. You will make a P.D.F. file. And I've just briefly explained how you can do that you go through the options button. You click on that. And then you select the notes. Pages. There are different options but you have to select the notes pages and then. If you click on OK. There will be a P.D.F. file and. In a P.D.F. file. There will be the slides and the notes. Underneath it. And you upload this. As a P.D.F. in. Feedback fruits. So that will look like this if you pick fruits. You have. This is the P.D.F. with the slide and the notes below it. So every student is going to upload this. In feedback for its. OK. Then you have done that. Then we're going to do next step. You're going to compare with other students. Between different countries. So what you first do is look at the uploaded B.D.'s of the other students and you give feedback. Maybe things are not clear so you can ask questions. So I also provided an example here we are again in a few pick fruit. Environment and for example you can ask a question. Do you know anything about. Reasons why diabetes is very prevalent in Germany. So and then. The person who has applauded this can again give feedback on that. So that's what you do you get feedback to each other member of your small group. And ask any questions. If they are there. OK So after giving feedback. Then one person of your small group. Is going to combine all the data off the difference countries. In one slight. I'm also going to give you an example of debt. So again. In feedback fruits. You make a P.D.F.. One person in a group. First makes a Power Point slides. With the data from the three countries or four countries. Make a P.D.F. and upload to P.D.F.. Again. In feedback fruits. So after that. As a group you're going to look at the comparison between the different countries. And you're going to discuss about it. How come that's diabetes preference is much higher in this country. Compared to that country for example or. Why is there are trends. With a higher prevalence in one country. Compared to the other country where it's maybe going down. So you're going to discuss that's. If you pick fruits again an example. So this is how it looks like it's light and there. You're going to discuss. If you pick fruits. About the difference. Countries and the different figures that are given here. So you do that as a group is your responsibility as a group. And then finally one person of your group is going to give a summary of the all discussion at the stake and place in feedback fruits. And that is applauded again. In feedback for it. So let me show you an example again. This is a comparison the three. Between the three countries. Many more though over into Spain. And here. There is a summary of the group. Discussion and a comparison. And one person puts that. Again in a Power Point slide. Makes a P.D.F. and loads this feedback for its. So and that's what you do actually for all the eight. Topics. All the. Eight step assignments that are part of this. Bigger health policy. Assignment so you do it is eight times. And so also make sure that you do fight. Do your tasks. Within your small group. So that one time one person. Makes a small summary. And the other time. For the other topic. Another person in the groups. Make. Group makes a summary. So yeah. Make good agreements. Among each other. OK So then you have done all the eight assignments. And then the next step is to make your own individual final product. And that is forty eight. Topics. Make your own powerpoint presentation. And you prioritize. You have to give advice to the minister. Which topic. He or she has to include in the policies or should it be De Beers or should a minister do something about cardiovascular diseases and. Give good arguments for your for making the priorities for the different topics. And that's your final. Outputs. And that's the stuff. That's just the final product also that you are heading in to the tutor. OK. I hope this was clear. In the clip I fixed playing to you about how the policy assignment. Works for the AIDS topics. It's goes throughout the whole course. It's consists of these smaller. Eight assignments. There's a lot of individual work. You have to collect information about your own country. But there is also quite some collaboration and comparison with other countries. Between the students in your small group. Thank you.",

                "text": "Hello. Welcome back. This is the fourth clip. In a series of clips. About the analysis of. Categorical data. And we're going to talk about Fisher's. Exec test for the two by two title. So let me show you on the map where we are. But actually over here. And we have only one clip. To go about. Ault's and. All trade shows in the series. Let me recall the example. We had to close on Friday's A and B.. Forty blogs. Off a righty. A sixteen of a righty B.. They're supposed to be random samples and. For each Friday. We observe the number of infected plants off to a certain period of time five out of fourteen for A and twelve. Out of sixteen. For B. and willing to state whether. The probability for infection. Of the two Fridays is the same or not. For this to be two title. And exact as was proposed by our A fisher. And it's goldfish exact. Test it's not quite regional but. It's an appropriate name I guess. The test. Also applies. When you're not interested in a test for. Homo. Jeanette U.T.. Which is the case here. We want to compare the two probabilities. But when you're interested in a test for independence. So I would both. Applies to how much you know eighty. And independence. Now suppose that A is in you for ID and B.. Is an existing Ferrante in that case. I may replace B. but only when we can show that it has a lower probability for infection. That means. That would actually intrastate in a one sided. L. turn if I put assess what is the basic idea of this test. The idea is that we fix. All margins both for the. Rows and Columns. Two of them. Fourteen and sixteen. Are already fixed and they are. Our sample sizes. But the other two seventeen and thirteen. They are observed. But. We treat them as fixed as well. We list. All the tables. With the same margins. Fourteen sixteen seventeen and thirteen. But with different numbers inside. And then under the knowledge poultices. That's the assumption of how much united. We can attach a probability. To each of these tables. In order to do so. We use a specific distribution. Called the hyper. Geometric Distribution we won't get into any of the details. Then we consider all tables. Of our least. That are as extreme. Or more extreme than the observed table that is extreme or more extreme. With respect to rejection of the knowledge purposes. These are all the tables. With the number five four three two or one. Here in the upper left hand corner. You can think for yourself. Why. Zero. Cannot be there. We sum the probabilities. Attached to these five tables. And that's the one sided. Piece. Now. What about a two sided P.L.U.. We could be interested. Just in comparing the probabilities and. Having the alternative. That they are different. That's a bit awkward. Because unfortunately. The two sided people you. In this situation. Is not well defined and this is just one. Possible definition. The same as in our textbook. We consider all tables that are. Again. As extreme. Or more extreme. And that amounts to. All tables. With a smaller probability than. The title. When you add together. All these probabilities. We get to two sided. He fell you. This is how it works out in our. Again. We have the numbers in a vector. We need. Row and column factors. To show how it's organized. We can define a table and. We can ask for Fisher's exect. And this piece value over here. Point zero six three. Is that two sided P.D.L. you that's the default you can ask for the one sided which would have been more relevant here. As well. Over here. You have to result with a guy square approximation. Again. This is a two sided P. failure. You can see that the two P. values. Are quite different. And in this case where the numbers. In the table. Are rather small they're well advised to use the exact P. value. From Fisher exact. Rather than the approximate one. Obtained by the usual. Squared approximation with one degree of freedom. In this case. By the way. For larger tables. This idea of fixing margins. Formally called conditioning upon marginal tape. Totals for larger tables. You can use this idea. As well. So you can have a look again at the probabilities. For tables that can be considered as extreme. Or more extreme than the observed table. At and together. To get a piece. You can calculate. Pearson's chi square for each of the tables and of the ones with the same value. Or a larger value for Piers and Sky Square. They are the ones that are. As extreme. Or more extreme. And some for some software package use you can have these exact. P.V. elegance and. Of course when your tables get smaller in some sense. You're well advised to use them. Details of the calculations. Are beyond the scope of this course. So in summary. We have an exact test with an exact B. value for the two by two title. And in particular for small counts. It's better to use this exact P. value than the approximate one that we discussed before. Based on a car squared distribution. Fifty six ECT asked. Originally. Yielded a one sided P.L.U.. There are several suggestions for the. Two sided P. value and one of them. Was in this clip. Thanks for your attention. And see you in our next. And last clip.\n",

                "text": "Hi there. This is the third clip. In a series. About the analysis of categorical data. That's coming data. Organized in tables. Let me show you where we are on the map. We now here we go to talk about. Pierce and Sky square test for independence or. Homo to now U.T.. And we have two clips to go. Let me recall the example that we showed you in the first clip. We have two hundred fifty managers. That's supposed to be a random sample. And they are classified now. Into whites. Richard Speck. To H. and with respect to promotion. And the question is Does age matter for promotion or more formally. Our declassification promotion and. H. independent. That's formally our knowledge poultice now. In the table we have observed counts. Like nine. Like twenty nine. Like thirty two. Up to forty. Over here. Eight different counts. The counts. Have two indices. The first one. I is for the row. Promotion or not. The second one is for the column the. Class. We're going to calculate expected. Counts again. Will be a bit harder than the previous clip. And again. In the test that they stick. We will compare. Observed and expected counts. Under the knowledge poultices. To decide whether we believe this novel this is or not. Now this is how you calculate an expected value. For example. Will take the expected value of the first cell over here. That's the first row. And the first column E. one one. The expected value is the sample size times the probability for this cell. Of the table. The probability. Under the knowledge part of this is the product of two separate probabilities. One is the probability for promotion. The first row. And the other is the probability. For a young manager. The first column. These probabilities are. Denoted by. Pi one. Dot and buy dot one. There is a slight problem here. Are Not A large part of this is not telling us what the values of these probabilities are. So we have to estimate them. So that's why there is a hat. On top of the E. Indicating that it is an estimate. We need. Estimates for these separate probabilities. So what's the probability for promotion. Well. Eight managers. Out of two hundred fifty are promoted. So as an estimate. We use eight. To over two hundred fifty. What's the probability. For the young age class. Well. We have fifty nine inches there. Out of two hundred fifty that fifty. Over two hundred fifty. So we end up with the row total. Times the column total. Divided by the total sample size which is sixteen. In this case. In general. For any cell in the table. We take the total. Of the row. Times the total of the column. Divided by. The sample size. And for instance. The N. Y.. Dot here. Means that we take the total. Of the I throw because the dots for the j means. Some of the columns. And the end dog. J. means take the total of the j to call them. Because the dot. We place in the I means. Some of the rows. Now. Here's an exercise for you. This is how we have to calculate. Each expected value for each of the. Eight cells. You're currently are asked to calculate two of these expected values. So stop the video please. Do your calculations. And when you're ready. Please come back. Hello again. I hope you have the answers. Here they are pretty easy had one two. That's the first row. And the second column. The number twenty two point four here actually. We take the total. Of the role. Eighty times to total of the column. Which is seventy. Divided by. The total sample size to it and in fifty. We end up. Indeed. With twenty two point four. The other number. We have to end up with fifty four point four according to the table. Is actually the product. Of the row total one hundred seventy. The column total. Eighty. And again. Redefined by two hundred fifty fifty four point four don't. Round. These expectations to inches your numbers but. Use them as they are. So what do we do. We run through the. Eight cells again. Each time we take the difference between what we observe. And what we expect. We square. We divide by the expected value. We sum it all together. And up with thirty eight point zero two five. This is generally. Our test to test it looks like. We have a double summation. Because we are summing over rows and over columns but essentially. Is the same test that they stick. As in the previous clip. So is thirteen point out to five. Large enough to reject the null hypothesis. Because again. Large numbers for the test that is thick. Indicate that what we see. And what we expect under an olive poultices. Is not the side. So again. We need to distribution of the tests that they stick under in all our policies. Of Independence. Again it will be approximated by a car or square distribution. The only difference is in the degrees of freedom. This time. They are equal to the number of. GROSS minus one. Times the number of columns minus one. And that's three. In this case. With pick your S.. We can ask with a guy square again. Ripley degrees of freedom. We can fill in the outcome. Thirteen point zero two five. Ask for the probability. In this case development one is the probability to the right. That's a P. value. It's point zero zero four six. It's a very small way below. The usual point of five indicating that this is a very large. Value and. You don't expect it. Went in all our policies is true. So we reject it. We conclude that. H. and promotion. Are associated. Which means that age matters for promotion. This is how it works out in our. It's a little bit more complicated than before. We have our counts. Organized in this sector why we need. These two factors. To indicate how the Count's are actually included in this factor why. We can make a table. We can print it. And we can ask for the summary. Which will include. The consequent again. Same outcome of course. Thirteen point zero two five to three degrees of freedom and. The small piece out. So you can play around with this and see whether you can reproduce this yourself. We can actually arrive at the same table. Through a different route. We could have decided beforehand. To take fifty people from the first seventy from the second. Eighty from the third fifty. From the fourth. And have four separate. Random samples. In that case. The test. Is called The test for homogeneity. How much in a T. of probabilities. Because now we're testing whether the probability for promotion. In each of the. H. classes. Is to seyne or not. For. You know Italy. The calculation of the test that they stick. The guy square approximation. The pv value. They all. Remain the same as before. And a conclusion. Again. Will be. That age. Matters. For promotion. So their way. We can arrive at a table. May be different. The name of the test. Either independence or. Homogeneity may be different but. The inference. Afterwards. Is the same. So in summary. We have a course of continuous the table as it is called. Where data are arranged in rows and columns. We can either. Obtain this table from one launched sample. Where all the units. Are classified with respect to two classifications. And one is for the rows. And the other for the columns or. We may arrive at a table. Using different samples. Several random samples and. Maybe the rows. Are the one single remaining question for cation. And the columns. Correspond to the samples. Like in our example. We discussed a test for independence. And a test for how much in eighty. The test works out in the same way and. We compare. Observed and expected counts. In the same way. We use the same test that they stick. The same Pearson chi square statistic that is. We have the same approximate prevail you. From a car square distribution. Degrees of freedom. Are the number of rows minus one. Times the number of columns minus one. Thanks for your attention. And see you in our next clip.\n",

                "text": "I there. This is the second clip. In a series of clips. About the analysis of categorical data. That's data. Counts. Organized in. Tables. So let me show you first. Where we are on the map. But actually over here. We just started with a number of examples. And we going to use one of the examples to illustrate. Pearson sky square test for goodness of fit. Let me recall. The example. We had two hundred patients that were all treated for blood pressure disorder. And they all received a new drug and their reaction to the truck. In terms of their decrease in blood pressure. Was classified in four classes. We had one hundred twenty people in class one. We had sixty people in class to ten in class three and ten in four. So these are observed numbers. There is also always standard drug available. It has been applied for quite a while now and. Since it has been applied to a large number of people. We know the percentages of the people in the different classes. They are. Fifty eight twenty five ten and fifteen percent. And we wonder whether the new Druck and the standard drug work out the same way or. Not so are no hypothesis. Actually is that the probabilities with the new drug by one by two blithely and par for others say. As the known. Probabilities for the standard rock. Point five. Point twenty five. Point ten. And point fifteen. When the null hypothesis is true. So the two drugs are the same. We would expect. Fifty percent of the people in class one. That's one hundred twenty five in class two that's fifty. Etc. So this is what we observe. And this is what we expect. Under the knowledge poultices. And we're going to compare the two columns of numbers. We going to do so in a test that they stick. The test that the stick is to to call Pearson. Over here. And the idea is that we look at the differences within each of the clauses. Between what we observe. And what we expect. And since we don't care for negative or positive. We squared to get rid of the minus signs. We also divide by the expected value. So we have four of these. Square differences defied it by expected values. One for each cell and. The total result. When we add them together is twenty four point three three. Before we proceed. Something about this division by. E. You can see. We have a difference. Sixty minus fifty. Of ten. In class two and a difference. Of minus ten ten minus twenty and COS three. So squared. That's one hundred. On both occasions. But this difference of ten between. Small numbers. Is much more telling than. This difference of ten between launcher numbers the larger the numbers. The bigger the indifference can be just by chance. By dividing by the difference. Corresponding to a small expected value gets more weight than. The difference corresponding to a large expected value. That's the end to it if explanation. There are technical reasons as well. When the new druck. And the standard drug. Are not the same. We expect. Differences between what we see and what we expect. We expect a large value for the test that they stick. The question is is twenty four point three three. Large enough to to reject on the law poultices. And decide that a new drug is different from the standard drug. In order to do. To decide. We have to know. It is to view sion. Of the test that they stick. Under the knowledge poultice. That distribution. Can be approximated by a car squared distribution. Akai square distribution has degrees of freedom. And in this case. The. Degrees of freedom. Are three. One less than a number of classes four. So the guys greatest addition can tell us whether the outcome is rare or under the knowledge poultices or not. This is actually how the Keiser square in this case. Looks like. I used a program called. P. Q. R. S.. Which is freely available from the Internet. You can see that. Twenty four point three three is way in the tail of the skyscraper distribution. The area to the right. Is the very small number point zero zero zero zero. Over here that's the P.F. L.-U. it's way below zero point zero five. So we have to conclude that. Twenty four point three three. Is a very unlikely. Fell you. Very large value. Under the knowledge poultices. And we will reject it. You can't play around to repeat your S. if you like and. Select some other distributions. And see how this works out. Right. This is how it works out in art. We have perfected with counts. We have affected with. Specified probabilities. Under the null hypothesis. We can ask for our cause square test. We get the same answer as before. Twenty four point three three. The three degrees of freedom and. The very small people you. That leads to rejection. So we conclude that a new drug. Is different from the standard drug. And we can actually conclude from the numbers. That it is doing better. Because we have larger numbers than expected. In the classes with a marked. Or at least an important. Decrease in blood pressure. And we have smaller numbers than expected. In the classes where there is hardly any improvement. This is how it looks like in general. We have to take losses and a sample of size N.. If counts. And one. Up. Two. And K.. We have the knowledge of both the sis. That gives. Specific values. To the probabilities. For the different classes from these specific values. We can calculate. Expected values under an ally poultices. And our peers since. Chi square. Goodness of Fit statistic. Compares. What we see. The ants. With what we expect. Under the knowledgeable says. The P. value. Is the area to the right. Of the outcome. It can be approximated. Using a cry square distribution. With K.. Minus one degrees of freedom. One. Degree of freedom. Less than the number of classes. This approximation. Is supposed to be valid. When. None of the. Ease the expected values. Are less than one. And where no more than twenty percent of the use is less than five. If you have a small table. Meaning. A really small number of counts. In some or all cells. And this. Approximation is in doubt. You can also get and exactly value. If you like. It's often available in software and. The so-called. Multi normal distribution. Is used for the calculations. So in summary. We were looking at one random sample. And one classification in. Cake losses. We have a now hypothesis that specifies the probabilities for the classes. We have observed. And expected. Counts that are compared with the test that they stick for. Pearson's chi square. Statistic for goodness of fit. We have an approximate. Pete alue from a guy square distribution. The number of degrees of freedom. Is one less than the number of classes and. If you're really getting worried about this approximation. Often exect P. values. Can be obtained. As well. Well. Thanks for your attention. And see you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hi. In this clip. I do explain you. About drop outs and noncompliance in our in the My School until trial. And the big question is this drop out or noncompliance. Threat for internal and or for X. to an awful itsy. I think you recognized it Skee this scheme by now. You have to target population. The source population is the population of interest for your study. People are selected in the study population. And old timidity for the paper population for analysis. But it may happen that people drop out from the study. Audits. People don't comply to the prosecute of study and to explain what happens from it. Into an affiliate A-T.. I will use an example. In this example. We have two groups. A group with fish oil. And a group with a placebo pills and. The subjects are randomized in those two groups that are interested in blood pressure changes. You measure. Blood pressure at the start of the intervention. And at the end of the intervention. And here you see the results. Suppose we have one hundred exposed people. And well when that people in the control group. We measure blood pressure at the start and at the end. So for each group. We have a change in blood pressure. Well say for the exposed group of people taking fish oil. Has will NEVER it's a drop of twenty in blood pressure. OK so little high boots just an example. And the people in the next post in the pussy boat group. Only drop. By five units. And the outgoing message of the study. Is the difference in blood pressure changes. So in this case. You know if this is a difference. Now the big question is what happens with. Into an affinity. S.P. people drop out. From the study. Here again you see the results have the results and to determine what happens from people drop out from the study we have two questions and answering these questions helps you to systematic a purely decides better is a bias in your study. But these questions are a little complicated. So for now. Forget about the questions. And I will just use common sense. Reasoning. To understand what happened. Suppose ten percent. Of supect. Drop out from the study. Both in the fish oil. A little pushy book group. So the big question is do you still trust your results. Well first I will write down the true results. As well her nurse. Suggests in each group. In the fish oil. Group. A drop of twenty. And in the placebo group a group of five units. Six and a difference. Of fifty. What happens. If you lost ten percent of all subjects. Well. Of all right. What if after this drop out. On this chart. You have ninety people here. Have if. Ninety people here. We lost. Ten people in each group. What happens with the blood pressure change. Well if you just forget about these people. All the efforts to blood pressure change. Remains the Same. We suppose that the drop out. Random some hard changes or drop out some low trained. Changes drop out. So the efforts. Blood pressure change. Is still the same. And this also counts for the next. Scroope. Some high changes drop out some low change fish drop outs where we still have the chains. Of minus five. And the difference. Is still the same as the true. So drop out. In this example. Does not affect the fellated T.. Of the study. We still trust the results. Well you can also use these two questions. To come up with the same answer the first question I ask. Looking to also picks together is the person to drop out those that differ between the X. post and the next post. Group. Well. The answer in this example is no in both groups we have to drop out of ten percent. The second question is a let little more difficult. It's ace. With in cases to be. Is it likely that the person to drop out the difference between the exposed and exposed. Well what's meant by case is to be in this study. We don't really have cases we don't have. Deceased people. But we can say OK people with a high blood pressure change. We call them cases. And not a question asked. Within the high Kingfish. I do more people the dropouts. In the fish oil group than in the pushy beaucoup. Because you can imagine that if. For example in a fish oil group. All people with the high teens. Drop out. The middle of the high to eat fish. And this fish. Yes just is lower. Well say only. Minus ten units of change in blood pressure. And if it's only in the fish oil group. That the high changes are the dropouts. And nots. In the placebo group. You see that this figure is also affected. Because not a difference between minus ten and minus five. It's only. Minus five. So in that case. We don't trust the results. But as there. Some poll gives no indication that it's our only hard change it will drop out. For now the answer is no. So you see in this example. There is no reason to distrust. Your. I recently met I did it. I just by logical reasoning. And looking at the figures. I know that I can trust my refills. And this is a so-called. Intensive prosecute. Analysis. The only includes the people in the study. That are applied to the brought a call so that are really in the study. And the older people do drop out. We just ignore. And although day of analysis is the so-called. Intention to treat and the other says. That means that even if people drop out from the study. You just try to have to best guess of their outcome. Well usually. You don't know what's the outgoing. And then B. you just use the baseline. Fell us. So let's see what happens in an intention to treat and assist. Again we have ten persons dropping out from each group. But no for the people the drop outs. We just include the baseline fell us. So they have to change. Fierro. And that's the effect. The mean things in that's group. Because if now for ten percent of the people the change is zero. Then the fifth year. It's a little lower. But the same happens in the next both group. Also in that group. We have a few people. What's the few people that drop out. So we include a change of Ciro the baseline failures and outcome failures are the same. So also the efforts to change. In your next post group. Drops. A little. And that means that the difference. Still state. Same for sample destructs by two units. This one drops by two units. And we still have a difference. Of fifty. So still no reason to distrust your result. So in this example. Both questions are answered by no. And there is no bias. Now we have another example. We have a drop out only in the fish oil group. Let's look and see what happens here. We have the true refills. One hundred people in each. Groups. A difference of twenty. In the Expos group. And this difference of five. In the next post group. And the difference between those groups. Minus fifty. Well the. Example Say we have only. Group out in the fish oil the exposed group. So it will expose group. It's easy. Still one has the bush and. Minus five different changes in blood pressure. We lost thirty percent of the people in the fish oil group. So we have seventy. Well what happens if we do a protocol and emesis. We just ignore the people in that in that group. So all efforts to change. Remains the Same. And your final change is not affected. But it is better to do. An intention to treat analysis. So again. In the face or group of people the drop out. We just take the very fine fellow use for it and. Measure and those people have no change. So all the efforts. We see a lower change. In this group. Say. Minus ten. Instead of. Minus five. And now we see that the difference. Minus ten. And minus five. Is Fife. So the effect of the difference. Of five is much lower than a difference. Of minus fifteen. So no we don't trust the refills on that's because the people in the X. post group. Drop out. But there are no dropouts in the exposed group. And again. You can do it for yourself. If you look at these questions. You will see that this answer. Question is answered by yes. And this this sentence is saying. Be VERY of bias. Involved the question is answered with yes. So the bottom line. If the dropout is really random and it's the same in both groups. We have no bias. But if the drop out. Depends. I did on the exposure or on the out cool. There is a bias introduced and you don't trust your results. How can we control for this kind of bias in a randomized control trial. Well most important is. During the design face. You need to prevent drop outs. After On the mutation and that's going to be done. Gone by using the run in periods. So make sure that people are really able to comply. To your protocol. And only if you are sure that people are able to comply to a protocol. Then random that. Randomised them. Into your study. And this decreases your. Dropout. Especially for intention to treat. This important to try to follow up those who drop out. But that's not all the responsible. And you can do one intends to treat analysis. You need to follow up. The Bushes that drop out or you need to have a best guess. Of the outcome. Like we did in this study. We just incorporated. The base life L U S S D and sell you. And in that case you have a bias. Or a bias is possible but. You always have a bias towards zero. So in the direction of no effect so you underestimate the effect of the intervention. And it is also important to consider whether you think that's bias expressions like we did. In this study. Just reason. About what's going to happen. What kind of people are going to drop out. And think about how Israel affects your affect measure. So that's a kind of. Informed guesswork. Well summarized in this clip. Our top two deaths drop outs. And then compliance. Are threats for into an affinity. When it does not occur at random. Then you cannot trust your resells and you need to be in a reality then you can alter she responds. Yes it.\n",

                "text": "Hi welcome. You are ready to start with the first week of this course and indiscipline are all introduced activities of this course. And everything in this week is about integrating. Of evidence. And you will study and the more you will and a discussion assignment. And here you see that over a few of the first week. Forget about all of us. And you see that in the first week. You have an emoji you'll get some clips and readings. And you have a group discussion assignments. And first I'm going to explain you. A little more about the model. Here you see the first screen of the more you. It's a lot of information. But for now it's important for us to see that. The topic. Is milk. And bone health and you will study the relation between milk intake and bone health. And you will study this relation from three different perspectives. First from an animal also on experiments. Second from human intervention trials. And you will look at off the face in our research. And take a look at the outline. And you can see what you expect for this week. First you gets a general introduction to milk and to bone health. A lot of biological information. And you will formulate your research questions. And in this example. You saw it the see a question that helps you to see how the relation between milk. Intake. And bone health. Is working. And what are the steps in between. And you will just wreck and drop. The right. Books is still the right places. And then you have the whole sequence of steps. And as you see. This is an exercise. And that's a new more more you know you get a lot of exercises. And I saw from these exercises you will learn more about milk and bone else. So it's learning by doing. Being active and so often exercises. After the introduction. You will start with your research. They will rise that over a few baits. Here again you see. The three different perspectives. And you will start with an animal experiment. And once you are finished with this experiment. Here you see the results. And I will show you the human intervention trial. And this exercise you will do sign your intervention trial. And you see there are a lot of options. You have to decide a lot. You have to decide. What's going to study you are doing. Which people you are going to include or exclude. What are you going to measure. What's your outcome. So a complex puzzle to decide how you intervention trial looks like. And after you know the signs your trial. You look at the recent. And here you see an example of the results. And again. Questions that helps you to interpret the results. And after you are finished. You come back again to this overview screen. And here you will see the symmetry of your results. I am not finished yet. So there are no rote results yet. But when you are finished. You have an overview of everything you did. And then the starts and very important job. Because you have to integrate all this information. To draw an overall conclusion. About the relation between milk intake and bone health. And that is what you are going to do and be flexing part. Well that's up to you. You can start with the more you will. But at least now you know what to expect. So I will close this. And I will tell you a little more about all the activity in this week. And even more of your. You get a lot of help. You are going step by step through exercises that help you to integrate all knowledge. But in this group assignment. You have a lot of freedom. But are you going to do well in your group. You are going to discuss that or there is a relation between fighting a ship limitation. And childhood modality. And in the first week. You are going to look at the biological mechanism. And the second Vic. You are studying. A large intervention trial. And as you will see there is a lot of discussion going around to this in defense of trial. Do you really trust the results. You don't really give evidence for a relation between five to mean a superman. Superman station and she also. Modality or not. So it's a difficult job to get these results. And the same is for professional research that you're going to study in victory. In week four. You are going to look that interest in for X. in between fights I mean a supreme EDITION and ALL the fx Nations. And again. The most important question is what's the total effort and. How to integrate all this separate information what's your overall conclusion. How are you going to do this as I said. You are working in a small group. With four or five people. And you will collect and discuss evidence. And there is some help a favorable by. Clips and by readings. Every week. You look at one or two discussion topics for your group. And one student. Will summarize discussion. And how you behave in this discussion contributes to your final mark of discourse. During the discussion so you will collect your best. Contributions and save them in your course so-called course portfolio. And this course portfolio. Will be yet. Judged by me and York if I'm Mark. But what's your best contribution what do I expect from you. Well. You can imagine that sometimes you have just a v contribution to the discussion. You just get some small facts. Or maybe you race an issue but you don't understand its well. Then don't attitude of course portfolio. But maybe sometimes. You really are able to connect. Facts to a new problem. Or to propose. New hypothesis. Or to really show that you all understand the concepts that are taught in this course. Well that's really good. And you can at the. Contributed at full in this category. To your course portfolio. And those are just. So they don't be afraid to make somebody contribute you because you are here to learn. And you can only learn by making mistakes and just by trying just by to discuss things. So don't be afraid to make mistakes. But don't add them taught a course portfolio. To the course portfolio just show your best. Thinks well. Now's the start time to start with your fear streak. Of course in the learning a foreign meant. You will find step by step explanations and some more guidance what to do. Well I hope you enjoy your first week. See you.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to the course introduction to analytical it be Community and Public Health. The second scorer in your program in this clip I'm going to explain you some basics. About this course. Like the learning I was scums. What can you expect in the next four or five weeks. And I'm also going to say something about the assessment of this course. But let me start with the. Learning outcomes. As you see there are six. Learning outcomes. First you feel again learn about its basic measure but now related to analytical epitome ology. The same holds for. Study these signs. You will learn some basic study the signs. You will learn about bias and about confounding. You will learn about internal and external Philibert see. You also learn about these. Screening. And finally. We are also going to look again at the sixty's easiest that were also. Discussed in a previous course. But now you will mainly look at what are the risk factors. Of for example diabetes or cancer. Well fairy briefly. Here you see this this course it's the second one in the whole program. But I would like to pay a bit more attention to what are you going to do in the next five weeks or so in the first week. You will learn about. Association and causation. What is the difference. You will learn about the study of these eyes you will get an overview. And you will learn about Felicity. Biased and confounding. And the activities that you are going to do are reading a book. Watching. Knowledge clips. There is a group assignments and individual assignments. And there is also a self test at the end of this week. And that holds for all the four weeks. In the second week you will learn. Mainly about measures. Measures of. Association and measures. Of public health impacts. And you will learn about the prevention. Paradox which of course also relates to public health. Then a week three. You will learn about as to cohort study and the case control study. And in week four. You will learn about. Trials and about disease. Screaming and in the other. The other parts of these weeks. You're going to learn about the difference of diseases I will stalking about. And as you can see here there is quite a variety of learning activities. Just by some reading. Knowledge eclipse modules where you can practice. Some of the measures. And there are some individual and group assignments. In this course like in the previous course you are going to again do. A Glossary assignment. Which starts in the first two weeks. And you are going to finalize in week Fyfe. And in addition to that there will be a multiple choice exam. In the last week. I'm going to say something more about. Assessments later on. But first I would like to show you that again. Weapon then will be the basic material for reading. And there are clips and. Modules okayed and now. On the assessment. In this course. Again fifteen percent of your mark will be. The glossary. Assignments it's an individual. Assignment and. The other eighty five percent will be. The multiple choice exam in a in the final week and also for this course you need to have at least a five point five mark for both parts of the exam. OK So in this clip I've explained to you about structure of the course. And you have learns about the learning outcomes and the activities that you're going to do. In the next five weeks.\n",

                "text": "Welcome. What is meant by it confounding. Do you know. In this clip. I would like to tell you more about a basic idea. Of confining. Based on a story. So last month. I was at a for a nice restaurant. I had dinner with some friends. And then we all sat down to debate. The waitress came. And she asked. Do you want something to drink. One of my friends ordered a glass of wine. And some waters did as well although she did. Order. Nor my colleague drinks. And I was amongst them because I don't like a call of drinks. After a while we ordered a main course. And after debt. We ordered the dessert. But the team a goat and dessert. Some friends. Went out. I went outside to smoke a cigarette. And when I was looking around a table. Something drew my attention. So I would for mainly Doe's friends who ordered a glass of wine. Who also went outside to smoke a cigarette. So those friends. Share common characteristics. They have a moderate alcohol intake and. They also smoke. If I want to investigate as you say to me tween. Moderate alcohol intake. And type two diabetes. How do we know for sure that I'm investigating this as you are she asian. And I'm not looking into the education between smoking and type two diabetes. Is it always the case that if you have a relation between. Moderate alcohol intake and smoking. There is always disturbed as you see Asian. Node it's not always the case. And I would like to explain it. And that's And first we considered. Two scenarios. Suppose that the true essence. Between. All current take and type two diabetes is inverse. So that's what depicted in this figure. The brat. People. Indicate the persons with type two diabetes. So what happened. If smoking. Is associated with a higher risk of Type two diabetes. So does. Will be combined. These To Association. If you do not take the effect of. The confining for a boy into account. So if you add these effects. It's likely that you do not observe an Asian. Because those people. Where for more alcohol intake. Also smoke. And smoking is educated. With a higher risk. And more of cheated with a lower rate. So if you combine and there is no issue. So what happens. If alcohol intake is not as you stated with type two diabetes. And we have. Still have education between smoking and type two diabetes. So where you combine these two affects you observe a higher risk. So more of our intake. Is educated with a higher risk but it is not due to the outgoing take but it's due to defect that. Persons who have a moderate intake. Also smoke. Is it always the case that. If you have a relation between smoking and type two diabetes. And moderate alcohol intake is educated with smoking then. That you. That always smoking is founder. No that's not always the case. Because you have to ask yourself. A second question. A third question. You do not want debt. Elke or is causing smoking and this so it's causing type two diabetes. Because in this situation. It is not a confounder. It is called an intermediate. Because if you take away the effect of. Smoking. You take away part of the effect of alcohol intake. So and that's not what you want because you would want to have to totalled. Effect of alcohol intake. On type two diabetes. And not fight. You would not take away the. Indirect the fact afire smoking. So in this story. I thought you did basic idea. Of confounding. So can you come up with the three questions you have to ask yourself. So the first one is the ferryboat a risk factor for the outcome. So is smoking. As you stated fifty risk of Type two diabetes. So do second question you have to ask yourself is do co-founder did with your exposure. So is it moderate alcohol intake. And third is defensible. Not an intermediate. In a causal part of a between exposure and outcome. So and if. All these three questions are answered with yes. Then you know it is a co-founder and. If it is a confounder. The education between your exposure. And outcome is to disturb. So do you observe. Association. Davey aid from the true as you say. And therefore the intern of validity can be Tretton. And as depicted in this. Of figure. So how can you do with confounding. So you can repair it in the data analysis. And you can prevent it in a design. So I won't like to mention shortly something about the first one. Because if you ran the mice. Then the second question. So is the exposure. Officiated with your. Confounder. Is always answered yes. But no. I mean. And therefore it is not a call from or it could be a confounder. So actually on finding organ aids from the leg over a new musician. So what did I tell you in this clip. So first of all. Confounding is a mixing effect. Of different fairy. Variables. It effects the intern of related to you and you can further fired by entering three questions. And it's maybe a parrot. In the data analysis or. You can prevent it in these A. Thank you for your attention.\n",

                "text": "Hello. In this clip I'm going to explain you about stick lottery assignments. Which is part of the first course. Well if you look at this slight. You see many many were church and. I can imagine it can be quite overwhelming. And this is only part of the word stator going to learn during the first course. To make sure that Hugh understand all these different words that you remember them. That you also understand the difference between the difference or words. We have designed an assignment. Called the glossary assignments and. When you make this glossary disk and also help you in subsequent coarseness. Because these were two these concepts. They will come back. Actually in all the courses of the master program. So in this. Glossary assignments. You complete a table with a number of words for example. Incidence rate or incidence proportion. Or epidemic. And for each virtue you have to complete the difference columns. First you provide a definition. You can get from a textbook or. From another source. You also provide the source where you gets the definition from. In a second column. You give a definition in your own words or you give an example. So that we can also see the human understand the concepts. Then in the third column. You provides the synonyms. Course for some words. There are different definitions and different. Synonyms. Used in it but in reality. Then the next column. You know provides an explanation of how this concept of Skokie latents. This will not hold for all the birch for example for epidemic of course there is no quick calculation. But how to calculate incidence proportion. You have to fill that in in this column. Then units. And here I mean percentages. Numbers. Also dead of course applies to a number of concepts but not. To all of them. Then there is a list of questions for each concepts. And you have to answer these questions. And it's mainly about what is the difference between one concepts and another. And finally this is for yourself. A column where you can put. Other comments. For example if you have learned something about the concepts and. It helps you to remember a better. You can put it there it's like an optional column. In addition to a number of concepts that are described here. You can also add your own words. For example if you want to. You learn certain verged are not in a column in the table. But that you find difficult. You can add them to also make it your own personal glossary. You can use different resources to get your definitions. This is the glossary of. Weapon being which is providing provided in the learning environment. And this for example is an overview of definitions given by the World Health Organization. You can also use that but also feel free to use. Other resources. If you think they are trysts were iffy. OK. You're going to make this glossary. In four steps. First. After each week. Make sure that you have completed its. Glossary with the words. Have been addressed during That's a week. For example. Epidemic is discussed in the first week. So make sure that you. Fill in the table for it were. Which. During that week. Then what you do is you share. The glossary with. One other students. And he or she can give feedback. So your glossary. And you can give feedback to the Glossary of the other students. This helps you to make sure that the definitions are correct. And maybe you can also learn from each other because the other person has. Yeah. Has given other information. Then based on the feedback you can improve the glossary if you like to. And in the final week. Week five. You can submit. The final version. And as you know it's that is also part of your exam. It's part of the. Assessment of this course. OK. To support you in keeping an overview of all the different words. We have also provided you with a mind map. And in the mind map. You will see a lot of words that are discussed during the course. But not all of the worst are in the mind map. Are also part of the glossary. So part of the words that you will see here. Come back in a glossary. We've only included the most difficult concepts in the glossary. Because it doesn't make sense to include debts. Yeah. Are quite obvious. But if you like to add them in your personal glossary. That's of course is fighting. So to mind map looks like this. Although there's a number of categories. Of words. And every week. You'll find an expanded version of the mind map where we have added the words that were discussed during that week. So for the first week. It's only. This part. That's in the second week. You will see that the mind map. Is getting bigger and bigger. Then finally. How are we going to assess this glossary. This is fifteen percent of your total mark for discourse. And you need to have a minimum of five point five. Ford of glossary assignments. Yes to hand in the final version in. Week five as I told you before. And make clear. In the final version. What article Pillsbury words. Sort of Verge that are in or original documents and diverge that you have added yourself to the glossary. Because we were only look at the comp bill three concepts. For the assessment. OK. I've explained to you about the glossary assignments. It is completed throughout the course. It will be an individual projects with. Feedback from another students. It will be a resource for. The other courses in the program and the mind maps are just a tool to support you in making the glossary.",

                "text": "Hello. Welcome to the first course in a mosque the program the G.M. public health. In this clip I'm going to explain you about still learning I was gone for the learning activities. And also the assessment of discourse. First I will explain you about still learning outcomes as you will see. There are five general. Learning outcomes. One relates to a general introduction to reality you need to know what it is and what kind of work you do in in practice. Secondly you need to know about the basic measures that are used in the script if you give me on a G. the third. Relates to a basic study designs in the descriptive. Me ology the fourth. Relates to standardization. You will all learn about this. During the course. And finally. You need to know. Some basic information. About six major diseases that are also discussed during this course and these are. Infectious diseases diabetes cardiovascular diseases cancer. Mental health easy this and. Osteo. Brosius in elderly people. As you see. This is an overview of the whole program. And of course this is the first. Course. I'm not going to talk too much about the other elements that you see here. Then this is the program for the five weeks. Of this first course in the first week. You will learn about the history. Definitions fields of the ME ology. And also the difference between descriptive. An analytical. You could in reality. And these are learning activities that you will come across. During this course. So in the first week. Actually in every week. There's a lot of reading watching. Knowledge clips. And here you've also due to individual assignments. Then Week two. You will learn about measures. About the difference between measure of mortality and morbidity and about standardization. In week three. You will learn about the study of these ions and also about public health and to prevention. The fourth week. Is about another set of measures. And in the final week. You will have time to finalize. Two big. Assignments. And of course the exam. And here you can read all the different learning activities that are applied. If you can also see there are two big. Assignments that you have to complete. Throughout the whole course. One is calls the glossary assignments and the other one is the Health Policy assignment and there you will apply. All that you learn. In the five weeks into practical exercises. We have some. Course materials. Mainly two books one from. Rep and then. And one of on the mean have monies. And of course the knowledge clips and. Some modules. Where you can practice some of the measures that you are learning throughout the course. Then finally some remarks about the assessment of this course at the end markets calculator it's. Using three assessment methods. The first one is an individual. Multiple choice exam. Is accounts for sixty percent of your market for discourse. And then there are two reports one is the glossary assignments. And the other one is the Health Policy assignment report. Because here is fifteen percent. And health policy assignment. Accounts for twenty five percent of the total market. And for each of the elements you need at least to have a mark of five point five. So in this clip I've explained to you about the learning outcomes to learning activities. And also how the Course is assessed.\n",

                "text": "Either. Welcome to this series of clips. About you know Alice is of. Categorical. Data. This will be the first clip where I will show you an introduction. Categorical data is about accounts collected. In tables. But let me first show you on the map where we are. We're actually over here. Obviously. At the beginning. And I'm going to show you a number of examples of tables. I'm going to show you what kind of research questions might be posed. And I'm going to give you a brief. Idea about what we're going to do to solve these questions. And you can see from the other. Video clips that we going to discuss. A couple of different tests. But you don't have to worry. They're all basically. Variations on the same team. Pierce and Sky Square. Test. At the end. Will have a clip where the ideas of us are introduced. And that is a link with another subject. About logistic regression. Which is also part of this course. We're going to look at two kinds of tables. We will either look at a table where. Units. Are classified. According to a single classification. Or. We going to look at a table where units. Are classified. According to two classifications. Let me give you an example of. The first kind. Here. We have one sample and. One classification. We're actually looking at data from two hundred patients with high blood pressure. These patients are subjected to a new truck. A new therapy. And after therapy. They are in one of four different. Colossus. Class number. One is the one. For patients with a marked decrease in blood pressure. Glass number two with a moderate. Decrease. People in class number three. Have only a slight decrease and and. Class Number four we have the patients that have no improvement. At all they have no decrease. Or even a slight increase. And you can say that from the two hundred patients that we have one hundred twenty. Shout. A marked decrease. That's the good side and. Ten of them shout. No improvement at all. That's the bad side of the story. Now these are observed numbers. I didn't twenty sixty ten and ten. That's what I see. For this new drug. They are called. And one and two and three and four. Now there is also a stand the drug around. It has been you. Used for years. Of many patients. And therefore we know already what. The percentages of people in the four classes. Are going to be. These percentages are fifty. Twenty five ten and fifteen percent for the four classes. So if we had applied. The standard drug here. From the two hundred people. We would have expected. Half that one hundred in class number one. A quarter. That's fifty. In class number two. Ten percent. Twenty in class number three fifteen percent thirty. In class number four. So this is what I see. With a new drug. And this is what I would have expected. With the standard drug. These are the expected. Numbers. He won the two three and the four. And the question is does the new drugs work out differently from the standard drug. So are the numbers that I see similar to what I expect. I would suggest that the two tracks are the same or. Are the numbers that I see. Different from what I expect. Which would suggest that the new truck. Is working out differently. And actually. From the data you could see that when it's different. It's actually working out. Better. Because we have a relatively more people in the classes with a marked or. Moderate improvement. And relatively less. In the classes where there is hardly any improvement. It makes sense that we going to look at the differences between what we see. And what we expect. And if these differences are too large. We reject our knowledge says that the drugs are the same. In favor of. The alternative. Actually that they are different. And in this case that a new drug is doing better. That. Test statistic that we going to discuss. In a new clip. Is called. The test. For goodness of fit now. Here you have another example of one sample again. But two classifications. These are results from a study. Into possible. H.T. discrimination. For promotion. Among middle managers. In a large company. We have two hundred and fifty. Managers here. And each manager is classified. According to age. In four classes from young to old and. Whether their manager. Was promoted or not we have observed numbers. In the table again. Like the number nine here. Which is the number of young managers. Under thirty. That are promoted. And for instance. The last number forty here. Which are the old managers. That are not promoted. So we have the numbers end. But this time. And one and two up two and eight. Again that's what we observe. The question is Does age matter. For promotion or more formally stated. Are age and promotion. Independent or not. It's possible again to calculate expected numbers. Under the assumption that there is independence. In that case. We expect. Under independence. Sixteen. Of the young managers. To be promoted. Twenty two point four. After less young. Medical still be promoted. Etc. The calculation of these. Expected values the second number in each cell. Is not trivial. We will explain. In the next clip. But again. We have numbers. And one and two and three etc and numbers. Each one a to you three etc. We going to look at the differences between and and again and attest that we will have. Is called. The test for independence. It's actually possible to arrive at the scheme. In another way. You could have decided beforehand. That you would like to have four samples. Instead of one. Fifty people from. The young managers. Seventy people from the next class eighty people. From the third class. And finally. Fifty people. From the class of. Old managers. In that case. We have four samples. Instead of one. We have the same table. We could have the same table. But we arrive there. By a different route. Now the design. Obviously. Is different. Not of example of two hundred fifty. But for seven samples. But the basic question. Is still the same Does age matter for promotion. For each. AIDS class now. Which basically represents a separate population. We have. I'm sample. For each age class we have a probability. To be promoted. We have four of those probabilities. And we wonder. Are these probabilities. The same. Or not you will see in a future clip that a test procedure is quite the same as before. But we call it now. A test for. Homogeneously. Here's a special case that we will have a closer look at. That's the two by two table and. Here's another example. We have two for rightists of plants. A and B.. We have fourteen. Plants from a randomly selected. Sixteen plants for B.. Also randomly selected. And after a while. We observe. How many plants. Are infected five. Out of fourteen. For a and twelve. Out of sixteen for B.. Again. We have a test for homogeneity and which. In this case is the same as comparing the two probabilities for infection. Four for writing. A and B.. And quite a while ago. A particular test procedure was proposed by. Ari Fisher. Fisher was something of a statistical genius he's all over the place in statistics you can see him working here on an early calculator. Which obviously is giving him a slight migraine and. This test. Is generally referred to as. Fisher's Exact. Test. In a future clip. We will discuss this test. And we will also use the two by two table. To introduce the concepts of. Ault's and. Orts rates yes. So in summary. In the next clip. We will discuss. Significant tests for tables. Tables from. One sample. With one classification. From one sample. With two classifications. From several samples from several. Distributions. Where in each sample we have the same. Single class of. Patient. We will look more closely at two by two tables. That will lead to Fisher's exact test. And we will introduce. Ault's and. Oughts right. Thanks for your attention and. I hope to see you back in one of the next clips.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this final clip a multiple regression. In this clip we go on to discuss. Use of Demi fables and put it through regression. But let me first show you on the map where we are. Well we came a long way. We started with a model in the least squares. In the F. tests and etc and we arrived here at the bottom. Two special cases Demi syncretistic and we start with the first topic. The use of dummy fables. Well actually so far expanded the referrals that we saw were quantitative like exposure time humidity in age. But what to do if they explain that their fables are qualitative. Like gender or type of tomato. Well such a qualitative explain that their fair ball is called a factor or group incredible. And we already know what to do. We use one way I know for to compare groups. But one way I know of model. Can be formulated as every question model as well using dummy fables and that's what we're going to look at now. So let's go back to the tomato example. That was discussed in one way or Nova. Response to the by fable is the sweet taste there were three types of tomato around before Sherry tomatoes and. The question is whether they have the same sweet taste. And for that we use the one we know from model why is. You placed on perception I J. There are two indices is an index. I've put a tomato type an index index j for the individual tomato within the type. If we work with. Arden Arbel ordered the types alphabetically so that the beef. Group corresponds to I won. The Sherry group. Corresponds to I quilted to. For round I study. I will also use a cornerstone representation. With the first level as the reference to the top one parameter is zero. Making beef the reference group. In that case the new. Represents the mean taste. To reference. Beef and talk to and all three are differences in mean taste of sherry around compared to the beef. We could also. Ride the model in a different way. Where we directly put the. Means in a systematic part of the model. You are. If you need more information return to the clips on one we don't know for more details. But we need to formulate this every question model our dummy fable So what a dummy variables. So a dummy. Is an indicator fable is there a one farewell which is coding for a level of effect. So here in this example. We have three types of tomatoes so we could find three different variables a dummy for a round to the ME for beef and dummy for Sherry. For instance the dummy for a round will be equal to one. If we have an observation for a round tomato and. Will be zero otherwise. Next we use these requests is these dummy fables as previous. So we formulate the regression model. As follows Why is speed as Year Zero an intercept. Plus B. The C.D.C. will be the R D R. So we use here to dummies for the sherry and put it around. So please note that only two dummies are used here not three. And in general we use one Demi less than the number of levels that we have in the model that contains an intercept. So let's not compare the parameters in the one where no far. And in the repression model. So here's the one way I know for model. You post all I hear is the regression model. Because you have up and beat a C.D.C.. But B. The R D R. So let's go through the three different groups let's start with the reference group to beef up the first one. The one million mark. One way I know for model tells it tells us that the mean is equal to well mew post or one of the top one was the arrow for the reference so sick with whom you. Used to mean in the first group. The regression model tells us. Beat a zero plus B. to C. time zero. Because we took our time zero. Because to to demonstrate the use here. Are equal to zero. For to be flip. And it yields. The Intercept. So actually the intercept. The the zero interview question model. Equals the mmu Indian over model. Which is equal to the mean taste. In the reference to. If we go to the second group to share a group. Then the one we are know from model tells us that the mean. Mean taste is meal pushed or true. And the repression model. Will tell us. Beat as hero please be deceit on one. Because we look. We haven't. A Sherry tomato now. But be our times hero. Because the demi. For around is equal to zero now. And we we get as the mean response because you have Opus. But the sea. In other words the slope B. to C. the recursion equals the top two parameter in the end of a model. So the slope B. to C. actually is the difference. You mean taste between Sherry and. The reference to the beef tomato. And likewise. The slope. Be to our. Equals the toss the parameter in the you know. Model and equal to the difference in me taste for round compared to beef. Suppose now that we are not using dummies for Sherry around but we use dummies for. Beef and Sherry. So we do to requestion of Y. on D B N D C. So what's now the interpretation of the intercept the B. to B.. And the B. to C.. So stop the plate for a moment think about it and then return. OK a little low again so here is the answer. If we use dummies for beef. And Sherry. Then obviously the round trip is the reference group. So intercepted the serial represents the mean taste for the round trip now Dimmu three parameters. The B. to B. tells us now. The diff. But the differences between the beef croup. And the reference group. So you won minus be a three. And a B. to C. parameter. Bremen to for the Cheri. Sense the difference between the sherry and around. You to manage to three. OK let's do this with our so let's. Fit. This. Multiple regression model using the dummy sort of first step is to find a dummy seriously dummy for the sherry. Demi forty. Round tomatoes. If Else function is used. And for instance for D.C. we gets one see if we have an observation from the sherry group perceive us otherwise. We put those then we see in the repression model. We regress taste in the two dummies and. Here is the result. The Intercept actually is the mean for the beef or the reference group. The slope for D.C. is twenty one point five telling us that the. Taste for the sherry is twenty one point five higher than for beef. And the slope forty our point nine tells us that the taste. For around this point nine higher than beef. In the one way I know for model. We would directly put in the qualitative. Expand the ferryboat directly. Tomato type and. The output is exactly the same as before. Well. That should not be a surprise because actually what R. is doing if you put in effect or into the real question will it will be find these Demi fare bowls behind a screen. OK. Let's go to the next. Special case the special case of court at every question. So we need a different example now. We go to the example of. Plant densities so we here we have a small dataset. With eight rows so it or eight plots and plans were planted the different densities densities. Eight nine eleven and twelve blocks. To square meter and the year per plot is measured and if we make a scatter plot of the day that we get something like this. Well what type of relationship do we expect between density and yield. Well actually you expect to see. In probably an increasing trend. And there's a certain. Moment there is an optimum and then it decreases again because if. Plants are too close together then the yield will be less than you might obtain. And there is some. Optimum density somewhere in between. Well let's try to first try to fit just a straight line relationship. Let's do it here simple linear regression we request the yield on the density and here is the fitted model. It doesn't look so bad but if you look a bit better you see that. For instance the density eleven you upset faces are quite a bit higher than what the model predicts so we have positive procedurals for the subsurface. And then City twelve this year the way around. There we have observed values which are lower than what the model predicts and we have negative he said you will stare. That doesn't look so nice so we would like actually to be able to Africa quadratic relationship. So that's what we do we defined a square of density. And we pluck. Not only the density itself. X. but also its square we to requestion model. This is still a linear regression model. And you could rename the density as X. one. And the square of density as X. two and you. Rewrite the model as B. this year up as be the one X. one must be the two X. two and you just see that this is multiple in your question. This is a model which is linear in the parameters not the next but into parameters. So still a linear model. And this model. It describes part of a parabola. So here is. Regression model formulae that. And here it is fitted in are we define the square of X. we put X. and its square into the every question model. And here are the least quiz estimates of the parameters. And here you see the fitted. Part of the parable. Let's have a look at the interpretation of the parameters when actually to be to zero over here. It's an intercept so it's the mean guilt. If the requests are equal to zero if the density is zero. And B. to one is the slope. Actually which. If the density is equal to zero. Be to measure the curvature. For B. to C. A and B. to one we don't have a nice interpretation here. In terms of this example because. Density zero is outside their veins of the use densities actually the fell you of the two parameter mind is one point two five. That is negative. It means that the fitted curve is part of a mountain shape arrival. As we see here in the plot if you would like to have. Coefficients but you can interpret. Then what you might do is the following You might not use the density SR requests but you might use that. Which is the difference between X. and its mean. So this is what's called a centered furball So you center around a mean and. You not only use this it but also the square of said S three Crysis. And we. You form the model in the following way. Gamma zero percent a one time step. Was coming to terms that square. If you would fit this model. And here you see did the code in our X. minus mean. Mean if X. is formulae that the square is calculated and they go into the repression model. Here are the estimated questions get except leave the same part of the burnable as before but now we can interpret the coefficients. The gamma zero now is the mean guilt. If set is equal to zero. Meaning density ten. In this case. The yield is nineteen. The gum or one is the slope. If a set is equal to zero so a density ten. And that failure was one point eight five. Means that the field is still increasing at an effort shall you have the density. And the gamma to parameterise the same has the same fill us before. So it tells you about a career feature of the relationship. OK In summary infective can be accommodated to linear regression by the use of dummy fables. Demi fable is a zero one fable coding for a specific level of perfection. If you have affected with. K. levels. You should use came on this one dummies. For a model containing the intercept. And by default the R. will drop to Demi for the first level so that the first level become the. Becomes the reference group. And the one way I know for a model then can be written as a multiple regression model with K. minus one Demi says regresses. With the intercept. Represents the mean for the reference group. And the slopes. For the dummy fables that represent differences of means. Of groups with a reference group. With a quadratic regression you can handle. Predictive relationships between the Y. in a continuous regress or X.. And predictive regression is multiple in your question using X. and its square. As requests. This was the last clip. About multiple regression. The next time.\n",

No we are making small steps and we call late and. Accumulate our knowledge. To a certain point where we are now. So and. That it indeed is an increasing. Area. And you can see that in this slide which gives the trend in published estimate a grief use a meter and of this. In the past twenty thirty years. So it's really. Enormously increasing. Effect you see. When you think about reviewing the literature there are basically two ways of doing that. And one is the negative review. The order the systematic review. The narrative review or just the normal classical ref USA I used to be around in the eighty's and early ninety's. They are very important. Because they are essential tools for health care workers. To know what is the state of knowledge of researchers of consumers and policymakers who want to keep up is the evidence that is accumulating in the field. But. The narrative. Reviews are the usual reviews the classical reviews have less and for this to cover the literature completely. They tend to me more qualitative. Of the nature. They want to identify the. Important developments. The highlights etc and. Provide the picture. That way. However with the increasing number of studies. You could. Would could be able to pick just. Studies you want to show and make your own story out of it. So it's becoming more and more important to have systematic reviews that really have all the evidence taken together. So this allows them if you do that for a more objective. Appraisal of the evidence. And that contributes to resolve the uncertainty when the original research reviews and. Editorials. Disagree. So it helps you to be more objective than you could be before in the. Refused the narrative rituals. And a systematic review would have tried to cover all the literature in the certain topics. May also include a quantitative summary of the evidence. And that is what we call a meta analysis. That the quantitative part. So systematic reviews and me that analysis. Do have to do with each other but they are not the same. Systematic review. Described. All the literature of and has a large narrative park not everything in it in the literature can be described in a quantitative way but where possible. And will. You can describe. Quantitatively. The evidence and summarize it. By combining. Pulling results from. Individual studies. The meta analysis. Combines results of different studies into a single estimate. And it does so by using the average the outcomes. And the weighing it off the. Specific studies. As they were published separately. And by doing that. You get them sort of overall average. Mean. And you do that in a way that the bigger studies. Count. Haveour. In his overall summary. Than the. Separate studies done the smaller studies. In doing so however you should always ask the question. If I'm looking at this exposure and another outcome. Is it just a FEIBEL to combine them with in one single estimate. If the quality of the exposure assessment are we really talking about the same exposure in the one in one study and another study. We're really talking about the same. Health outcome in the same definition. Can the estimates be compared are they a similar nature etc. All these questions need to be asked of course. Before you do so successfully. Meta analysis can and Hans the precision of the estimates of the treatment effect. If you are doing meta analysis. Of intervention studies for them in my control trials. Or of can improve. The precision of the association between exposure in the outcome. When you have. Observational studies. So it's combining results from different studies and weighing them for study size. That's the basic idea. Why do we need it. Well. When you. The implications of any study you do. Depends on whether the results that you've got. Are fell it. And whether they are precise enough. And that holds both. For a plea cations. In clinical settings. Aiming at the individual or for societal decision makers and public health. You need to be sure that what you or the associations you are talking about are really there are valid. And that you are quite sure that there. That you are by and large have the right. Or that of money magnitude so that. The precision. Part of it. However if you have different studies. You get different point estimates of the different studies. And then the question arises what is the best estimate and. It might be that state is just a very or result from difference it just cherry. Fairly by chance. Alone. But it might also be that there is a systematic. Reason that some studies are different because of some reason. From other studies. And if so you would like to understand why that is the case. So if a difference a systematic between studies. You should judge whether it's relevant or not. How could it be explained by. The study design or the way it was conducted. Or does it have to do. Differences between studies. Between has it does it have to do with biological differences between the populations difference in each already. Etc. This may tell you something about the causes of the disease. You are embarking on the meta analysis. Is not the thing you do in a few days. It takes a number of steps. It's really a part a type of research. Just like doing. And little epidemiology go study or a public health official. The meta analysis is also research. A search. And sometimes people have difficulty understanding how meta analysis and. The usual analytical epis to the how they relate to each other and this. Skin will help you to understand the differences. And also the similarities in the epidemiological study. You look at people individuals. In a population. Immediate analysis. You don't look at the. Individuals anymore. You look at studies. So here you are looking at different people. Here look. Looking at different studies in classical Epi study. You measure exposures. At the individual level. And outcomes are based on that your. Effect estimates like. All stray shows. Runs the risk. Differences etc. And you have extra information. On the people. Characteristics of the study population. And you need them to adjust for confounding. However when you are in the area of meta analysis. You don't have the people or the studies. And it's study. That's not gifted from each study you obtain information. The data. The results of a study like the odds ratio develop of risk. Or of the measure of association. And you combine them. To get an overall estimate of the effect of the association relative risk. For instance. And then you have other information. Also from the studies that are estates. Of the study design. As to the population. A biological background of the population. Etc. And that might help you to explain the differences between studies. So we are essentially doing a similar thing but on the. On the level of study rather than. On the level of individual interpretation of results. Here you have always a lot of attention for the internal fluidity of your study. And whether you can explain and. Extrapolate that to the outer world the external for liberty. And you Vic into the mechanisms. To give an underpinning. Whether your association. Might be makes biological sense. In Meta analysis. Again for you that he is very important. But now it's more on the with the question whether the pooling of the data as justified or whether there are big differences between studies. You can use me to another also to see whether the results of the pulling is sensitive to. In or exploration. Of particular studies. But there are some very influential studies which might bring the pooled estimate to a high or low value that are very influential. Did it degenerate life ability. By looking at the fact whether there are big differences between studies. And when that's the case generalizability is a bit more difficult than when all studies. Point at the similar strength of association. And in the end. You of course. Can use these results. To look at the relevance for the public health if you have certain slams of as you say she has a certain subgroups and you have an overall estimates that summarizes. All the literature. You might be willing to apply that to specific. Population in your country. And come to. Recommendations for public health interventions. So systematic literature reviews. Can be qualitative. Quantitative quantitative. Then we talk about the meta analysis. But even in a meta analysis. There are many aspects of. Qualitative judgment and. Evil away ssion of the data. To be considered.",

                "text": "In this clip. I will introduce you into biological models. Of disease. Causation. And epidemiology. The dentist or the associations. In observational studies. However in or. In the N.T. want to do right. Conclusions based on a causal. Model and. Causal thinking. Course and. Effect. That's what we are really interesting in because when we know about causes an effect. We have a sound basis for. Interventions and Prevention. The biological biomedical model for cause and effect. Is based on bass response Wace between the exposure. Of interest and the ultimate. Disease. That you are interested in. To study. That's what you usually. Measure in an epidemic logical study and then you assess the strength of the association between these two. However there are many steps in between that determine. In what way. The exposure. Course of the disease. Is a sequential steps in time. This. This model. Or originates from the environmental health field. In the late sixty's. And it focuses on a single exposure. That is power and at the same time of course is also a limitation because in epidemiology. We know that there are many component causes that contribute to a disease but in fact. You could follow a model like this. For different component courses and the strength of his knowledge that it. At a time order of sequence of defense. By defining the intermediate stages. So the exposure. In the first place. At least through an internal those leads to. For instance. Higher levels. In the bloodstream. At least one biologically effective dose. It might be. At the cellar level concentrations. Into similarly. To a response of tissues. They react. Or and I'm start to. Reacting and responding to work. And in the end it might even lead to an overt structure or function of the tissues and. That may be a precursor of the disease. On top of this. Each step is a biochemical biological step. And this. Partially controlled or. Influenced by. Susceptibility effect a few not sick. Acquired or inherited susceptibility. So that affects the strengths of each of these associations so the strength of a should maybe differ. May differ from individual to individual. As an example. Use. Aflatoxins and liver cancer and socialization. Here you see the. Peanuts that are responsible for as a source. On the humid conditions for two for gross. Of a spill of. Which produces. Under those conditions. Aflatoxins. And these are highly mutagenic carcinogenic suppressors when the liver is exposed to these other toxins or certain method to life they're off it can initiate and start a process. Of mutation Polish ration. Ultimately leading to liver cancer. And in between. There are a number of metabolic steps. Meant to detox a fiery aflatoxins. But sometimes they activate certain components etc. For the whole metabolic. Part. In between the exposure. And the fish a logical response. In the body. Another example would be. Iron deficiency anemia. This starts with the exposure to dye three. Iram. Which may be high or low and then it's very low. Maybe problems in the absorption of the IRA or sort of sufficient amounts of iron. And the wrong number of the bullet path. And therefore also. You know I think that was involved here. Which leads to difference of in the ability of our in for the formation of the red blood cells and. Therefore by two. And the potential for. Anemia which. At the clinical psyche you see in a number of different symptoms. So again here we have the clinical. Disease. Health outcome. Here we have the dietary iron a many. Metabolic steps in between. That have to occur in a certain time order. And where the different genetic susceptibility factors. Interfere. When you look at the scheme and. Consider these two examples. You will see that. The association between. Aviation steps. Steps. Close to its owner. Will be stronger. Now for more distant steps. Because when you have more distant steps. More factors. Are in between and interfere with the sequence of events. And interfere with the strengths of the association. So the more you're in the right. The more. Interference you have is environmental factors. Susceptibility affect us etc. That adds noise. To the association to the exposure. This is Arkan's extra variation. It is true variation because people are different. So we estimate. In fact the average. Of a population. Well it's. Internet the media stage. But also what you can see in this picture has many. Determinants it has the precursor stages. And it has the interaction of those. Precursor of metabolic processes. With the susceptibility. So when you go to the right in the scheme. It. Exposure that you're studying. Becomes less specific there are other exposures. Added to the way of thinking. And it becomes less. The exposures to being becomes less specific. And the other determinants you have in your model. Or the exposures may. Further to this. Variation in outcomes. And when those other factors are also related to the exposure. Then their confounding might occur. And might become the. Disturbed. Well this model of this conversation. Fits very well. Into the dish model that you have seen before. In fact. It is very much placed to the right side. To work. Of it. It's about the way how is to the epidemiology. How we do epidemiology in economic setting. Very much focused on. Causal factors. Because they are crucial for Also reasoning for. Underpinning prevention programs and public health strategies. Then we need to be sure that it's a causal thing we are addressing. There we are pain it is a biological biomedical model. When we incorporate determinants of diet a lifestyle into this model. We enter and. The add another area. Epidemiology of public health setting which is the actual way how we prevent. Health and. Prevent disease and. Do health promotion. And then you'll see that we have a social psychological model so that we need death to understand. The relation between the intake. Between the determinants. And the intake of foods. But basically it's a similar type of model. But the intermediates Here are four of a different nature than they are this model. So. In both situations we have. Theoretical and. Biological or. Social psychological models to explain the associations to understand what's happening. And to underpin causality. In the associations. So in summary. The biological model or helps us to understand. Both the biological possibility of. Association between exposure. And the health outcome. And it also makes clear why. It's quite complex to study. Not only one exposure but many exposure that. Interact with the susceptibility factors in the biological organism.",

                "text": "So in this clip. I'm going to talk about dietary intake and requirements a fight I mean a. In the first flight. You see the different recommendations for. Different age groups. So you see the recommendations for infants. For children. For adults and also for special focus groups such as pregnant women and electing women. And what is important to note here in this light is not only. The recommend that intake. But also the upper limits. For each of these groups. And you can see that sometimes the upper limit of intake. Is very close to the recommended intake. Now this poses a real challenge. On designing diets that provide enough vitamin A. But yet do not exceed that of intake. There are different forms of dietary frightening. Eighty. In the first place. There is pre-formed fighting age which is mostly found in animal foods. Mostly as Esther's. For instance in cheese. In liver. X. and. In some other products. But also in fortified foods such as the monitoring. In milk. In cereals. But in some countries also in sugar and. Oil. Well pre-formed Freidman eight poses the highest risk of. Exceeding the upper limit for fighting a intake. Because preform fighting. A does not have an act if. Feedback mechanism of. Absorption so. They enter our body fairy easily. This is different from profiling a cover up to noise because for Karata noise there is an active feedback mechanism that warns the body when there's enough vitamin A and. Send signals not to take up more. A rather noise. A corrupt tonights are found in plant foods. And mostly in yellow and orange. Vegetables and fruits. And also in dark green leaves. Such as. Spinach for instance. And a form in which corrupts annoys our presence is in B. to carotene Alpha carotene. And B. to crypt accent in those article rather noids that have. Vitamin A activity. So profile to mean a carotid noice needs. Need to undergo a Biocon first step. Beef. Before they can really express freedom in a activity. For instance for B. to carotene. The B.C.M. are one and zine. Needs to cleave it into two. Before. Retinal is being formed. And in Fiore you would expect at one mole of B. to carotene. Half the cleavage she would release two moles. Of retinal. However in practice this process is not very efficient. Because there are also other and signs that do not centrally Cleeve be the carotene. But they do it. This centrally we silting in no fragment a at all. Here you see a picture of Professor Clive West. He was a professor at our university. Inviting him and he passed away in two thousand and four. But he did a lot of work. On the bio of ill of bio availability of Karata noids. And he came up with a name on it for. Corrupt annoyed bioavailability. He called it. Slumming. And what does it stand for. Well there S. Stands for the species of Carleton or it's not all the species have the same. Frightening. A activity. And B. to carotene. Is the corrupt annoyed with most bite. By your activity a frightening eight. Then there is molecule or linkage. If a corrupt on the right is bound to other compounds in foods. They may not be so well. Absorbed as. When they are bound to others. The amount of corrupt annoyed stats. Is eaten in a meal. Is also determining bioavailability. And in general we can say the more corrupt annoyance. Are present in a meal. The less of it is being absorbed relatively. Then the matrix in which Karata noises are located appear to be a major factor in corrupt annoyed by your FIL ability. For instance in dark green leafy vegetables Karata noise. Are located in a part of the cells. That is very hard to digest forty human guts. And is also determined by availability of Karata noise. So dark green leafy vegetables are not very good sources of frightening. A After role. Then that can be effective self absorption and by a conversion. Present in food. For instance for. Karata noice disease. Fett. Effect is present in food. Karata noice are more easily absorbed. The nutrient status of the host is important. If a person has a fairly good fight I mean a status. This person will absorb less frightening a. Also genetic defect this can take a role for instance. It is known that there are. There are certain mutations in the B C M A one gene. That comforts. B. to carotene to retinal. And that these mutation. Mutations hamper. The confession of B. to carotene. There's a lot of research currently underway to determine the extent to which. This is important. Then there can also be other host related factors that play a role such as certain diseases especially. Diseases of the guests or intestinal. Tracks. For instance the presence of. Parasites can play a role. But also other infections. And finally did maybe some Mepham ethical interactions that I will not go into here. So it is clear now deaths. To confer Janelle of. Karata noice. To retinal. Is not always ferry efficient. And that is also why. Frightening. A In foods. Is expressed as. Retinal activity equivalence. That is micrograms of. Our aid. So one microgram of our eighty. Is equal to one microgram. Of threats or no or to twelve micrograms of B. to carotene or. To twenty four micrograms of other profile to mean a corrosive noise. So what it means is that you will need twelve micrograms of B. to carotene. To produce one microgram. Of retinal. There's also another way of expressing a vitamin A. Concentrations and that is in international units. And for your information one microgram. Of retinal. Activity. Equivalence. Equals three point three international units of retinal. And international units. Are mostly used for fighting in a supplementation. Fighting a supplementation is recommended for children under the age of five years. Encounters of Ephrata mean a deficiency is problematic. And there are guidelines on the prophylaxis of fighting mean. A In such boundaries. Issued by the international. Freedom in a consul dative. Group. In two thousand and one. And here you see. And over a few of what those who choose are recommended for what age group. As well as the frequency. Also for women who just delivered a baby. Dose a high dose of vitamin A is recommended. So in summary. What you've learned is that dietary reference intakes for fighting AIDS. Are expressed as a retinal. Activity. Equivalence. And these are a take the poor by availability and by a conversion of profile. Mean. A Karata noice. Into account.\n",

                "text": "So in this clip I'm going to talk about how to make your vitamin A status. There are many different indicators of fighting mean. A deficiency. And we can distinguish them in symptomatic indicators and. Asymptomatic indicate gaiters. First about the symptomatic indicators. Night blindness is one of them. So if. Nightline as. Is prevalent in a population. We also know deaths. There's a lot of fighting a deficiency. Another way of looking at it is to observe by toast. Spots in the ice. Which is as small scar on the cornea of the R.E. and the prevalence of that is also telling that there is fighting a deficiency in a population. And a third way to look at symptomatic. Vitamin A deficiency. Is to measure diminished. Dark at a take. I will talk a little bit more about it in the next flight. There are several ways also to look at. Asymptomatic Friday mean a deficiency and one of the most most important bombs is to look at serum retinal concentrations and we have to find a cutoff for deaths. So if Sarah writes a no. Concentrations drop below zero point seven Micra miles per liter. We talk about mild deficiency. If. Concentrations drop below zero point thirty five microns bullied or. We talk about severe deficiency. Apart from. Serum retinal concentrations we can also measure. Retinal binding. Protein concentrations. Because retinal is always bound to this protein in the blobs. However we do not have clear cut offs for B.P. And that is because there's always more. Our B.P.A. in the. Bloodstream and. What there is in serum retinal. Retinal concentration seem breast milk can also be used to classify a person. To be fighting a deficiency. And when the concentration in breast milk is lower than one point zero five my curly dis Micra most part leader. Then we talk about deficiency. This is an example of how dark at the station. Can be measured. As you know already fighting in a place an important role in it in how we how well we see in. Dim light. And that is directly translated to the pupil response. When you expose a person. To darkness. And then put a light on the eye. Then you see the pupil response. And the dark of the patients method that is shown here is developed by people from Johns Hopkins University. And how it is done is that's a person gets a dark pair of goggles on the ice for about ten minutes. And after deaths. One by one like pills was are being shed on the right. And what it measures eventually is. At Watts intensity of light that I is starting to respond. And also the diameter of the pupil can be measured. So this method is still under the fairly day. But it's a nice way of also measuring fry to mean a deficiency in people. One of the things steady is important to know. When looking at fighting a deficiency. And how to assess its. Is death serum retinal concentrations. Are reduced by inflammation. And many people living in. Counties where fighting a deficiency. Is presence. Also suffer a lot from. Inflammatory processes. So inflammation can be assessed by C. reactive protein for instance. Or by measuring Alpha. Like a protein. That is how it is often done. And we know deaths. C.R.P. is usually high. Upon incubation time. After an infection. Has happened. Of twenty four to forty eight hours. Whereas for early and late. On for sins. Two to five days. A G.P. is usually increased. And here in this picture you also see how this would affect. Serum retinal concentrations. So from a health. When a healthy person gets infected. The stage one incubation period. During that period. So your retinal concentrations are reduced by about thirteen percent. Up to stage two. The reduction is about eleven percent. Iris. In later stages. It will increase again. So it is also always importance that. Apart from measuring serum retinal. Also to measure. Inflammatory indicators. So deaths. The same retinal concentrations can be corrected for eight. Then there's another thing that is important to explain about serum retinal concentrations. Because serum retinal concentrations are under. Homeostatic control of the liver. So one state reach a certain concentration. In the blots. They will not increase any more. Despite the fact that. Liver stores may still increase. So when fight I mean. A state this is high sierra methanol concentrations do not reflect. Status anymore. But if you talk about fire to mean a deficiency which is up to more or less here. You see that the relation between liver stores and serum retinal concentrations. Is still a positive relationship. So there's a new way of assessing. Fighting mean. A state is that is currently used more and more. And that there's an isotope dilution methods. Of retinal. And that serves as a proxy. To estimate Hey peptic Frank I mean. A stores. The way it works is that a dose of labeled fight I mean. A is given at a certain period of time. Then after two or three weeks. A blood sample is taken and isotopic ratio. Is measured and. Through a set of calculations. Then a proxy can be calculated or frightening a stores in the liver. And that is the Olson in creation that is used for that. So by doing this before and after an intervention with profile to mean a for instance. We can also see the efficacy of interventions. On fighting a status. So what you have learnt now. That's a symptomatic vitamin A deficiency can be measured by. Biochemical indicators. And stare and retinal is the most important in a mostly practiced one. But it's important to keep in mind that inflammatory processes influence serum retinal concentrations. And therefore isotopic dilution. For the better indicator of freedom in a status. Especially in the attic where the range.\n",

                "text": "So in this video clip. I will talk about absorption and transport of fighting in a in a human body. So fighting a enters our guest or intestinal tract or to illumine as he's depicted here. And it can be in the form of for instance B. to carotene or. Off pre-formed find I mean. Both compounds are taken up in the Enter of sites and for B. to carotene. It needs to be comforted first. To retinal So that is a process that is taking place in the Enter of site. Beta carotene. Is conferred at the retina know by B C M A one and that is called B. to carotene monarch's E.G. nice. One and zines. Retinal is bound to sell or. Retinal binding proteins. Or C R B P two. And as such it is taken up in a cardio microns. And the kind of microns are then transported to the lymph docs. In the body. So fighting in a follows the same route as fat. That's a belief in respect of. Absorption and transport. And that is logical because fighting in A's effect soluble compound. Once it has been taken up in the lymphatic. Ducts. The lymph and a blot Xchange. And that is also how. Retinal gets into the he met existence. And once into a magic system. Fight I mean a can also be taken up by body cells. And that is what you see here in this picture. So. Retinal is present in the bloodstream. It is not present. As such because it is always bound to retinal. Binding protein and also to transfer a routine. In one. Plex with the three. Compounds together. Retinal is delivered. To body cells. Taken up there in the cytoplasm. Dairy can be converted to other forms of retinal. Such as written heal. Esther's or retina weak. Acids. To perform certain metabolic functions. If there is sufficient retinal in the body. The storage place. Of retinal is the liver. And there it is stored as retinal Esther's but it can be exchanged with retinal. So that it can also be used in the body. And the important function off. Fighting mean a. Is that it regulates D.N.A. transcription. And that is a fairy basic. Body function of fighting a. D.N.A. transcription is needed to produce. Proteins in our body and fry to mean a binds to the right to know what acid receptor is for debts. As to make it possible to transcribe. D.N.A.. So what you learned in this video clip. Is that fighting a follows the same absorption route. As dietary fats. Also you have learned that B. to carotene. Needs to be cleaved. To retinal. My B.C.M. are one. And in the bloodstream Vitamin A is bound to retinal. Binding protein. And all sorts of trans fire eating. And that is is how it is delivered. To body cells.\n",

                "text": "Today I'm going to talk about finding a frightening a effect soluble component that is present in our diet and that is fight all to life. And first of all. In this short video clip. I will talk about the health five comes to fighting AIDS but before going there I would like to tell you shortly the story of the discovery of frightening a already in the fall sent three before Christ Hippocrates prescribed animal lever. To cure night blindness. But he didn't know what he'd waltz into labor. That actually cured the night blindness. Well it took a long time before fight I mean eight. Eventually was identified as the active metabolic. That was only discovered. Around in one thousand nine hundred six. And until that time people believed that food. As it is present. As our diet only consisted of carbohydrates. Fats. Proteins and minerals and it was not anymore to eat. But in experiments with animals. It appeared that. Animals could not survive. On these components only. Only when extracts of milk are Akyol course attitude had diarrhoea. They could actually grow normally. And survive. It took until the one nine hundred thirty S.. Until the structure of fighting in a. Was finally. Directories. And that is what you see here in this light. So here you see the chemical structure of fight I mean a. Usually in the strict use. Fried to mean A is called all trans retinal. But when we use it in a colloquial form. Retinol is often referred to as preform fighting in a which he said group. Of closely related compounds. That includes all trans retinal eleven says that a null. Retinal Pelle might be. And also some other compounds. Apart from pre-formed retinal We also know corrupted noids and corrupt and Noyce are not really frightening. A. But they are cold. Profiling. And that is the case because corrupt annoyed Sneed to be comforted before they can actually have frightening eight activity. But corrupt annoyed so are a group of. Big men. That is present in foods that are not produced by animals that are correct for ice by certain structural features. Well when we look at the fight to mean A activity of components. The form that is actually carrying out its. Fighting a function in our body is the essid form so that is it right to know it acid which is depicted here. So what are now the functions of fighting in a in our body. Well the most important function to fight him in a is of course. In our facial. Function. So far to mean a as important for. Color perception. But also for seeing rel indium light. And I will come back to deaths later. But apart from that fight I mean a has a whole range of different functions in the human body. For instance cellular different differentiation. Especially for the mucus accreting. Cells in our body. That is the lining of. Our guest and all. Guest Star intestinal tracks for instance. But also the lungs. It plays an important role in the synthesis of glycoprotein So for instance. The transference. Synthesis. In embryo. Genesis in the immune response. Reproduction. In the mobilization of Iran from stores and that also explains why fight I mean. A and iron. Metabolism are. Into chronic that. And lastly. Vitamin Ney's also important in a deep. Elements of. Miscall low skill adult issues. But as sad already. The most important and most visible function of fighting age. Is in our. Facial. Cycle. So fire retinal. Fight I mean. Eight X. as a co-factor in regulating the rot. And Cone photoreceptor cell function in physical processes. And that enables us to see well in dimmer light. So what happens when a person is frightening aid efficient is. The first sign is that a person becomes night blind. Bots. Except for night blindness There's also a more severe consequences of fighting a deficiency for our physical function. And in the most severe cases it will lead to complete blindness that is also irreversible. Nightline is however is reefers a bull. After. Sufficient amounts of fright I mean they are being ingested. What else can we say about fried to mean a deficiency and. Our health. When night blindness is present in a population. It is actually only the tip of the iceberg. That is physical. There will be many more people in a population that will have systemic effects. Caused by a deficiency of fighting in a such as impaired immunity. Morbidity anemia. Grow fell during. But it may also be. L. to ration is in genetic. A method balik function. There will be to shew and plus my depletion. And chronic dietary deficients. And what is also important to know is that if there's a fear of T.. Off. Fighting a deficiency. And its manifestations. Also to mortality risk increases. So in populations where Derry's night blindness due to fighting a deficiency. Also Dimmock mortality risk. Of children. Thirty age of five years. Will be increased. So in summary what you have learned in this short Phidias. Tape. Is that fighting an eight is effect soluble fight I mean we have an important role in human fission and. That deficiency of fighting in a leads to a range of systemic affects. And increases mortality risk. Of young children.",

                "text": "Protozoa discourse of food borne illness. What are protozoa. Well. They are single celled. Eukaryotic. Organisms. They cannot grow. Outside the host. They are parasites. Organism itself. Is very vulnerable to environmental stresses. Such as low Ph. But they can produce resistant structures such as cysts and O. Ses and it's just it's very comparable to a bacterial spore that has a thick cell wall that protects it from the outside world N O C S. Are actually already. They are the result of sexual reproduction. No. Dose response. Relation. Exists for all. Protozoa. In the stable you can see the most relevant protozoa. With respect to food borne disease. As you can see that the host. Is very often. Yeah. Man or. Animals and a sorceress especially in the first three you can see that water is always there. They are transmitted through water contaminated water. And then. If contaminated water is used for other food. Food products such as. Fruits and vegetables or. Just contaminated water. We have a contamination cycle. In the case of the last one. Toxoplasma. We can see that the cat is a central role. And then. In gets case. The organism is transmitted through meat or. In case of direct contact through cat foetus. So let's talk about they produce cysts and in this. Drawing. You can see your sister. What happens if they get into the stomach. The low ph of the store make gastric. S. it will make sure that this. Goes open their cell wall if they solved. And in a so-called. Trophy. So whites are released. And these are the active forms. And they will go into the. Gastro intestinal system where they get gifts systems such as diarrhea and nausea food sources for this better gin are actually salads and foods. Washed with contaminated water or. Just drinking contaminated water and. In this case it's also important to know the chlorination of the water. Which is often done. For drinking water. Is not very effective. To kill this protozoa. Furthermore. Treatment with drugs. Is available. So if you have an infection with the R.D. alum Yeah. It can be that or. You can be released of this passage and. So if you look at another. Of these protests are parasites and to me by history little. We can see that the transmission firewater is furry much like that of the idea. Only the symptoms. Are very much difference. And the symptoms are. Amoebic dysentery. And that means that this burst site. Invades the intestinal wall. Gets into the blood system. And then ends up in different organs such as in the liver. Where it can produce a liver abscess and that can give you a very serious disease. But luckily. Also for Enter Mima. There are effective drugs available. If we go to the third. Parasite. It's being transmitted through water. We talk about cryptosporidium far from. Which also has a transmission cycle through water. In this case through. Oh cysts. This infection can be asymptomatic. But it can also cause severe diarrhea. Especially in susceptible people. So it's a studio piece. To have been some huge. Outbreaks with this parasite. For instance in one thousand nine hundred three United States in Milwaukee where drinking water was contaminated. And there were more than four hundred thousand people. Ill. From this definition. And more recently. There were also some. Outbreaks with ballots that were washed with contaminated. Drinking water. So if we hear about this drinking water being contaminated with this cryptosporidium. This was actually a good lesson for companies. So that they have to realize that they have to include in there has a plan. But they have to make sure that the drinking water. Is free of these pathogens. And also for this passage and. It is known that it's glorying resistance. So chlorination of drinking water. Does not help. Against cryptosporidium. However. What you can do is just boil the water for one minute. Then all the group to spray the INS are dead. Let's go to the fourth. Approaches zero one. Toxoplasma gondii I. And this is all one produces zero zero systems and tissue cysts. And I will explain those. So they get. Place a central role. It's the definitive. Host. So the full circle. Takes place the growth circle takes place inside the cat. And the cat can then produce this. Oh sister that looked like this. Into your Vironment. Through the fetus. This. Fecal contaminated material in the outside. May end up. For instance in mice and rats. Because they eat. Maybe contaminated grass or contaminated to fetch the balls. And in that way. There seems to use are also pray for cats. We have a cycle. So how do we as humans get this parasite. Well. Please Oh sister. That are in the environment. They can go to food of plant origin. Vegetables for instance and if we don't cook them. We may end up with a disease. Also it's a plant. Native plants can also be food. For farm animals. And what happens in farm animals. Is that these they produce. Tissue cysts. So they will grow out of the Toxoplasma. And then it goes into the. Into the into the must also. And that is the part that we eat. So if we under coop. The meat. Then we as humans. Can also be contaminated. Also they can be direct contact with cats through their For instance the cat boxes that are used for cats that are staying inside the house. So they can be also in direct contact contamination. And you can see here that the human. There is in this. Transmission cycle that's a pregnant woman and. We put it there. Because especially pregnant women are off risk because if a pregnant woman gets. This parasite. It can be transmitted to the fetus. And then a fetus. Can get severe effects that can be a spontaneous abortion. But I can also be. Brain effects or. I defects. And it's also known that persons. Having this parasite inside their body. Also is to shew cysts. May also transmit this disease to other people through lot. Or organ donation. So what are the symptoms of this disease. While we talked already about the spontaneous abortion and the ID facts and brain effects that it can also cause changes in behavior. Especially if these tissue cysts are created getting into the brain. But they can also be completely asymptomatic. And that's. Again. Dependent on the spot where at least issues just appear. So in summary. We have seen that protozoa can cause food borne infections. And they are mainly transmitted through water. Or through cats. We've seen that are resistant structures. Are cysts. And our systems. And we can also see that the prevention. Would be using clean drinking water. Make sure that the meat is heated. And also for a good. Personal hygiene.",

And that means that they need an animal host. To be able to develop. They undergo a life cycle. In the host. And it can be from egg. To intermediate stage. Such as larvae. Into a mature worm. Worms or Helminths as they are also sometimes called a classified. According to shape of the adult. Worm. They can effect worms. Such as Tremont olds and sisters and they can be round worms. Such as nematodes worms. Are going through a complex transmission cycle. Which are very specific for each worm. And we will go over some of the cycles in the next slide. But there is no growth of worms in food. But foods can act as a vehicle. In this table you can see the most important worms. Related to interest mission. For Food. You can see that the hosts. Are Always animals. And you can see that a food field goals are made mainly meat. Except in the last case for economic progress. You can see that first fruit and vegetables. Are the main food Feagles. If we look at the transmission cycle of ten years sodium. Which is the big tapeworm we can see that the pig. Is in the center. It is actually the secondary host. Which means that the egg. Can go and develop into a larvae. And his larvae. Inside the pig. Will go into the muscles. And that means that it ends up in the meat. That we would normally eat. And then if we would consume this meat without proper heating. We can also get this work inside our body. And we as humans are different if. Host. And that means that the full cycle. Happens inside the human body. So the larvae. Will mature until the full tape worm. And in this picture. You can see. The tape worm. You can see the head. And in the top of the head you can see some hooks. These folks are the ones that are touching themselves. Into the intestine. And then. There are different segments. Produced and it grows. All the way down into the intestines. In the segments. X. can be produced. And then. In this system. Segments may break free. And the X. will come out. And then through fecal oral transmission. It will end up again in the pig. And then we have a full cycle. This is similar. Transmission cycle. Is also happening. For Cheney acid Natta only in that case. The secondary host. Will be couse. And beef. So what are the symptoms of Teigne infections. Well these mature tapeworm. It can grow in the intestines are already mentioned that it can be very long. If it attaches very high in the intestines. And it can grow. All the way into this six like intestine. Part of the body. And they can grow up to be. Twelve meters and in that case they consist of more than two thousand. Segments. And the segments are called tides. They can contain the eggs. If this were. Grows in the intestines. The symptoms can be asymptomatic. So no symptoms at all but mostly. There is some nausea. Some with pain and in many cases there is also weight loss. And it is because we have to share the food. With the worm he's worms are quite big. So that means that humans. Human patients. Get less nutrients. The effects can be more severe. In the O.P.'s. But luckily there are some drugs available. To get rid of this worm. Let's go to a not or were tricked in the last be rallies. If you can see. Is also. Oh. Related to pigs. So big it's actually in this case a primary host. So we have a full cycle. In the pick. Justice system. Be Philip into worms. Which will then produce larvae. And these larvae. Travel through the body of the pig. Into the muscle. And then maybe this pig is fed as some animal waste to other pigs. Or maybe there is. Cannibalism. Because some pigs like to chew on a charter. On their ears or on the tails. Or maybe through rodents. They can be a circle contamination. How do we get the stricken area. Well. Obviously through the meat. So the cysts that are in the meat. Through the poor. Get into the humans. Which are what we call that and. Hosts. And that is because these instant just assists. Will grow into food worms. And they may produce larvae. But these larvae. Don't leave the body. They go into the system of the human. Into the muscle. And in that case. Yeah it's stays there. So what are the symptoms of the stricken allows us. Well. There are some steps that you have different symptoms. So if we have the larvae that are for invading the intestinal mucosa. That will be normal gastrointestinal complaints like diarrhea and nausea. But later on. If these larvae. In fate insist in the muscle tissue. Which you can see here. You can see here straight at muscle. And here you can see just trick an ally spear alast getting into this muscle and here you can also see why it's called tricking Ella Spiritus spiral shape. When it gets into the muscle. Then you get. Muscle pains and these muscles but in skin be very severe. So this is a quite a severe disease and. There are some drugs available. But they may not so. Work so very well. Luckily in the case of. Developed world. This worm is quite. Eradicated in. Farm animals. But in wildlife. It is still very much prevalent. And that's why it's important to separate wildlife. From the mist the gator picks. Let's go to the contamination cycle of. A can of Coke a small two local artists. The folks tapeworm sort of folks. Has a central role in this case. The worm is developing in the fox. And it produces eggs. And maybe also segments. Into the feeds us. And then. In the areas where these folks are walking. All kinds of foods may be contaminated. Through the foetus such as berries that are growing at a low low levels. But also some fish to both in very often. There are fish to book Arden's located next to forests were also foxes. So I can be contamination of fruits and vegetables. And then. If these are consumed by for instance. Mice or rats. Which are prey animals. For the foxes. We have a full circle. And then. Let's see what happens to humans. If humans consume. These berries. Which are contaminated with these eggs. Yeah then the person will develop a disease. And this disease is actually quite serious. It's called. You know crop goes. And it produces cysts all in the body. And usually it starts at the liver. And then it can also go to the lungs. And it means that our system. Everywhere. In the party and it. Sometimes it takes a while for symptoms to appear and then can already be too late to get rid of this worm. So that means that it can be a lethal infection. Fish. Can also be. Carrying parasites. And worms. For instance the herring. Can carry on the sack East. Which is the herring worm. And this produces symptoms like don't know pain is abdominal pain is not really because these were miscarrying in invading in the intestines. But it's mainly because of the. Of the working of the immune system has a very rapid and quick reaction. And that causes actually a nominal pain. So now there's a law that says that all freshly caught. Herrings. Have to be frozen. At least for twenty four hours. At minus eighteen. And that actually kills these worms. So again. It's safe to eat the fish in a raw. Way. So what are the preventive measures against worms. Well all slaughter animals. Have to be checked. Have to be examined before slaughter. Because if they carry a lot of worms. They may also have. Yeah show. Different behavior. They don't feel so healthy. And also after slaughter. They will be checked. Many of these worms you can just see with the naked eye and eye what happens. If you see multiple spots of parasites. This meat is rejected. It's been destroyed. If there is a local contamination. Just a small part of the meat. That has parasites. It will be treated. Maybe he did. Or maybe frozen. Like we saw for the fish. This can also happen for instance to get rid of tenure stock the matter. You cough meat. And also another. Preventive measure would be to educate the consumers. Make sure that you do an adequate heating. Of the food. Before consumption and. Also if you collect. Varies. Wild berries or grow fetched balls. Next to forest. You have to make sure that. Either you cook them. Or you wash them very well. To try to get rid of all the eggs. So in summary. We have seen that worms can cause food borne. Infections. And that the potential fear calls are mainly raw meat. And raw fish. But in some cases also fruits and vegetables. Health burden. Is dependent on the prevalence of these worms in wildlife. You can imagine that there are some areas where there's a higher preference. Than outer areas. And it also depends on the consumption patterns in different cultures it's in use to eat for instance. Raw fish. Such as herring. Or maybe sushi.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip will be about habits. Many of our dietary B.A. views are a bit you will for example. Eating snacks or eating fruits is something that we do simply because I'm always to them in a situation. And what happens when a behavior is habits will it means that there is no deliberate decision making anymore so we don't make a decision to eat fruit. Or we don't make a decision to eat a snack in front of television. It has become an automatic response to an end foreign mental Q. What is important to establish is that in case of strong habits. Intentions are less predictive of behavior. So intentions are not as important anymore in determining our behavior. And this is something that we investigated. A couple of years ago in a study. Among among adults. In this study we followed a group of adults. During a year and we asked them to report on their intentions to eat fruits the actual food consumption but also the extent to which eating food was habitable to them. What you see here and described as. Is the result. Model of this study. It's a depiction of the T. area of plan behavior. And a theory of planned behavior. As a dominant model that actually issues that people have attitudes. Social norms. Experience a particular amount of control over their behavior. And those variables predict whether or not one will experience an intention to engage in a particular behavior. Intentions in turn. Are the single most important predictor of behavior. So intention is to eat fruit. Are hypothesized to be the single most important predictor of actual. Eating fruit actual behavior. We investigated in this study to what extent this model applies for those who have weak habits. To eat food and for those who have strong habits to eat fruit. And the results are depicted into the figures that you see. Next to the lines it depicts to regression coefficients. The strength of the. Relations. But what you can see in described is that for those who have weak habits. So does represent the up of figures. Subjective norms or attitudes. Those are relatively important. In predicting intentions. And also importantly. Intentions for death. For that particular group. Are predictive of. Actual food consumption. But what we also demonstrated in this study is that for those who experience strong habits the Saudis are to. Below figures. In this graph. These relations. They actually weaken or actually totally diminish. So for example so you see that subjective norms. Attitudes. There are not significant predictors of intention any more. And also the relation between intention and behavior. Well for Charlie. Diminishes so. There is no relation between intention and behavior anymore for those who have strong habits to engage in food consumption in this case. In this study is a sort of a replication is a study in a community sample and which. Also a group of adults with us as to report. To what extent they engage in unhealthy snecking and to what extent they engaged in. To what extent is snecking was a result of. Habits. According to them. But also to what extent they had intentions to do otherwise. And what you can see in this. Table this is actually the table that presents to results of the study. Is that habit strength. Was the single most important of behavior. Important predictor of behavior. So. Habit strength over rules. Intentions. To eat healthfully. For example. Also perceived health consequences were in very predictive. Habits rang for the single most important predictor of actual. Eating behavior. But how do we know if this is a habit. Is or on healthy snecking habits will. For example in this case. You see a boy on the. Sitting on the couch in front of the television. Eating crisps. When would this be a habit. What makes a habit. What is important at habits is more than just something. Doing something just regularly so habit is more than frequency. But frequent execution. Is required to create happened so. We need to do something repetitively before. The habits will develop. But this repetition. It's important that it occurs in the same context. In the same situation. Habits are formed. When behaviors from better to flee. Perform in the same context. Because in that particular situation there. Develops a strong mental link between a cue. And the behavior. So there is a strong mental association between a particular situation and behavior most important is that this situation. It can be a time of the day it can be a place but it can also be for example. An emotional states or. A social social situation or a social surrounding that. That actually creates this link. So habits are acts a magic cue. Response associations. For example every day at work around four o'clock. You have an afternoon dipping you crave for Snick and. You are badly. Decided to take a cup of soup to nuts who have to be this afternoon break. When you do it is repetitively. A mental link as it is created so it means that at a certain time. Around four o'clock at work you experience your afternoon dip then at some magically you will get the afternoon. That you are usually half so this becomes habit you will. In this clip. If you learn that habits. Are formed when behavior is performed for a pet of the flea in the same context. And a cue that symmetrically elicits behavior. Even if there is no intention to do so.\n",

                "text": "This knowledge gave will be about how to Messick behavior. What is our domestic behavior. Of Bartsch it is the first one to actually introduce this term and. He labels out a mess of behavior by four typical corrector mystics. Equals these the four horsemen of are to much to city. The first one is that a demented behavior is. Efficient and with. Efficient. I mean that actually there is no self-control required it doesn't cost any effort to follow. Behavior that is. Out to magic. I do method behavior is also largely unconscious so it means that to behavior. Maybe down. Without us even being aware of it. This also makes it very hard to control. Because it's very fast it's very efficient. It happens outside our awareness it's also very hard to stop for people to stop there. Our domestic behavior. And most of the times I do magic behavior. Arises without even an intention. Being there to do show. It might be for some odd to magic behavior is that there is an attention present for example when your first day. You have the intention to get a dream but might also be very odd to magic for example to get a glass of water. So sometimes an attention is present but it is not required for it's a magic behavior to be executed. Is out to much as it be a problem. Sometimes in health. Health behaviors and specifically in dietary behaviors we seem to fink so for example the picture with the boy in front of the T.V. eating snacks. While watching T.V. in this case. If this is a dramatic behavior then. It might be problematic because it might be hard to stop or. Might be hard to control for this particular individual. But ultimately city might also be a good thing. For example if we have to be. It is hard to medic for us to eat fruits or. For example when we don't have. Think about effect as we brush our teeth every night before we go to bed. And also the use of safety bells for example in a car is something that we do a largely out to magic. So in these particular behaviors ultimate to stay can be. Can be quite beneficial. And actually. When we think about our to Misty whether or not that is problematic it's good to think about the different characteristics of ultimate to city. So for example we started this with. Saying that I to measure behavior is largely efficient. And that's a good thing because when we don't have to. Fink about behavior we don't have to make sure it's. Effort in a particular behavior it means that we still have effort and attention. Presence that we can direct to other course or other things that we find important in life. Also defect that are a large part of our behavior is unconscious. Might also be considered a good thing. There's no deliberate force required there's no deliberate choice required. It's very hard to imagine if I were to make this city you wouldn't be present then. It means that simply every act of we have to do in life. From opening the door to. Putting a cap on the toothpaste for example. If we have to think about all these actions as simply impossible we don't have to resources to do so so the fact that a large of our behavior is unconscious is actually might actually be a good thing. But the fact that it is unstoppable and hard to control is something that is problematic it's requires particular interventions to. Really interfere with with our genetic behavior and that's. That's something that needs to leads to a lot of developments. When we go to food and eating. Specifically for discourse on public health nutrition it's interesting to see. To what extent is our eating behavior. Actually have bitch role. And Brian Wansink and I scalded Sobel they actually did of that investigation to see how much. The food decisions do we actually make every day and how much of this. Be of these behaviors. Is resulting from more automatic processes. And it's rather shocking to know that every day. We make about two hundred food decisions. And already starts in the morning you have to fink. What you will have for breakfast. What you will drink with it. If you're preparing lunch how many sandwiches what you will do on it how much you will do on those. We simply make a lot of decisions about food every day that weekend or actually deliberately. Think about or actually make or make choices about. And in their study they actually suggested that. About seventy percent So actually a substantial majority of our food and eating related. Decisions are with a result of our domestic behavior. So this is quite substantial and this is something that's important to acknowledge for public health nutrition. Also to give you an ex some pull people with big balls and be exposed ate more ice cream this is a study. Also by Brian Wansink and his colleagues. And what he showed in the study and actually it's been replicated quite often is that when people are served food on larger plays with larger spoons they simply eat more not because they think of it it's just happening out to magic. I'm taking this example because it's also important to acknowledge the difference between. Habits. And our domestic behavior. It might not be. And habits to eat whatever is on your plate or to eat more. When you are using a bigger spoon is something that just happens. Without your awareness. Simply because you don't even think about it. So that's a magic behavior is more than just a habit and in this clip you have learned that a large part of our dietary behaviors. Actually result from these out to magic processes. Which means that we don't think a lot about our eating behavior. They occur outside our awareness they're on the attentional. But therefore they're also very hard to stop and to control.\n",

                "text": "This clip. Is about can project or. Can project or. It's actually one of the few bacteria that you can recognize. If you look on a microscope. Because it has a very nice spiral shape. It also has a very correct touristic motility. It is very very much associated with this organism. If we talk about better in relation to food borne diseases we are talking about a thermo tolerant types and these are Kemper back to June I can commit to Larry I can predict a cold light. They have a gross temperature. Between thirty forty four degrees centigrade. It's an optimum. Forty two degrees. Which is the body temperature of birds. Because that this. Growth temperature is limited. That is so very limited. It means that it cannot grow in food and. The camper better grow best with reduced. Oxygen concentration. And that's why we call it a micro air filter organism. Grossed best five to five percent of oxygen. The organism is also very sensitive. It's sensitive to drying. Which happens during chilling of the meat. It's also sensitive. For heating. And for freezing. And yet. Although it's a very sensitive organism. It is the number one course. Of food borne infection scorched by bacteria. So it causes. Kempler bacteria Oh this with. Major symptoms of guest or in try to us. That's diarrhea. Often belly cramps. And also feel for him blood in the fetus in time with an average of three days. That can be up to seven days. And the duration of the disease is also one week. It has a low dose response. So you only need few cells to get ill. And in some cases develop such as reactive or Freitas. But also the embracing of them which effect which is a very severe disease causing paralysis. Reservoir of these. Better. Are all kinds of animals. But mainly birds. And also pets and. You can also find camp or better. In water and you know what is very special about a camp or better is that it's has a small ferry ation on the Y. axis we can see the number of cases. And on the X. axis. You can see the time. In different years. Two thousand and eight two thousand and nine. I can till two thousand and twelve. And then you can see that the number of cases is always high. In the middle of the year. Which is summertime. In Europe. Because these are European data. So each summer. There is a high peak of Kempler better cases. And this coincides with the prevalence of can predictor in chickens. So that shows that there might be a strong late relation with prevalence in chickens. And the consumption of chicken meat and that is east. So the environmental cycle of camp or better is. Well we put a little bit in the center poultry is very often contaminated with Cam protector. And also cattle can be more of contaminated. Through the shedding of the kempler better in the food system also be a farm and can be contaminated water can be contaminated. Patients. May share. The company better as well. So it gets into the sewage systems. We've done some real research in the sewage systems and we found out that although there is a little bit of. Reduction of camp or better. In the effluent. Of the sewage system. Also contains better. So that we also have not self complected in the surface water. This can also then maybe. Infect people. Directly. We know of an outbreak of. Complete victory over. After a match for a mountain bike people. They've got some much splashed in their face. And after a few days a year. I felt. So apparently only a small drop. He's already enough to get the disease. Also are the consumption of contaminated meat. Can cost the disease. So if the meat is not cooked properly. Or if there's cross contamination. You can get the disease. Also couse. Having the camp of actor in your foetus may contaminate the milk. And if the milk is trunk roll. Then you can also get the disease. We can illustrate that also. In this slight. So milk is normally best arised for fifteen seconds at seventy two degrees. And we have new term and that. The failure to decimal reduction failure of Camp are better at seventy two degrees. Is less than one second. So these five fifteen seconds. Is more than enough to kill. All these Kempler vectors in the milk. But still people. Sometimes doing from milk. And this is what happened a few years ago. Very group of people visited the farm. And they all wanted to taste a broad milk. And they really got a very nice textbook case of. Of company backed Rio's as you could see that these are the number of cases. After three days we got most cases five cases. And up until seven days. There were still a person. Falling ill. From this consumption of the raw milk. So you can really see that it's not wise to drink. Raw milk. The fact that these complete actor has a low dose. Relation. Low dose response relationship is also put here in the schedule. So here you can see the person. Cutting chicken. On a cutting board. And you can imagine that if you used the same guy for the same. Cutting boards. To cut. Maybe some vegetables or salads that are not heated anymore. You get a contamination of this. Sell it and in that case maybe get the disease. Also. Maybe if you don't he did properly. Or again. If you get cross contamination. Maybe from raw food with processed food with raw food. You can get contaminated contamination. Of the processed food and keeping in mind. The low dose. Base will then also result in the disease. So what can we do about this. What are the preventive measures. Well of course we try to work prevents the infection at the farm level. With hygiene measures and also maybe. With looking at specific races of chicken that may not carry this camp of activists. But it has proven to be very difficult for someone else. These works well. We have seen it for example a vector. Yeah. We don't gain a lot of progress. So what we need to do is limit the spread of the contamination. Keeping in mind that scan predictor can be spread. With six locks. If you Burke gram fetus. It would help if we could reduce these levels. For instance with. Adding bacteriophages against. Camper back to two chickens. This will not completely eradicate the temple of actors but you get maybe. Lower levels and in that case. Maybe lower numbers of cases of illness. You can also do channelling. And channeling. Is. When you have contaminated flocks so that you don't sell it as raw meat. But just. He did make products like chicken nuggets maybe. And then use it in that way. Or you can do. Just explore. So early in the morning. Make sure that you slaughter. The flocks that are negative. For example of actor. And then later in the day. You used the flocks. That are contaminated. So you don't get cross contamination from the contaminated flocks to the non contaminated flocks. So in summary. We've seen that camp of actors associated with birds but also with other animals. And with water and warm milk. The fact that it doesn't grow. Below thirty degrees. The grease means that it doesn't grow in food. But it can survive. Very well. At low temperatures. Although it cannot grow. And also because it is a very low dose. Pathogen. It can still cause a lot of infections. So we have to make sure that we have a good. Handling of the food. Good eating good hygiene. And also try to avoid cross contamination.",

                "text": "This clip is about someone else or someone has a bit complicated to taxonomy so I will explain about nomenclature of someone else. Actually there are only two species. Some relevant gordie and someone else. And try to go. Within the species. There are some. Subspecies. For instance. Some lands right into subspecies and try to go. And then within the subspecies. Guess of her destructive Asian with many different. Sarovar. For instance we have someone alive and terra cotta subspecies. To recap. Zero four. Die from your ear. It's really a long name. So that's why we often for convenience sake. We will abbreviate this to someone Ella in your ear. It's also important to keep in mind. How you have to write. These names. Check out when you have to do. The I tell X.. So to species. And subspecies and in genus as well. Should be written in italics. But the farce. Are not written in our tell X.. And it should be written. With a capital. So someone else. Is also one of the group of to ensure bacteria see. It looks very much like. Eco lie it also is a gram negative wrought with many flagella. It also has a very broad. Temperature range. So it can grow. From five to forty seven degree centigrade. And it can also grow at a relatively low water activity. Of zero point one hundred three. But we have to keep in mind. That is water activity. Is related to growth on the other hand. For very dry products and products with very low water activity. Someone I like an old pro. But it can survive. For a long time. Also we know that someone ally. Is protected from the guest to get it. If it's cool Sure together with products and. In these cases. You only need a few someone eles to get it all so someone allows us if we talk about it. These off. Someone and we will in this clip only. Restrict ourselves to the norm. By four wheel type. And someone else's. And it causes guest orange writers. With symptoms off of the mental pain nausea and diarrhea. And there's an incubation time. Very common for food borne infections one to two days. The duration of the disease is three to seven days and. Usually healthy people will recover. Quite quickly. But for the obese. They have to be careful. For dehydration. So did. Those responses usually quite high. Except in the case. When the someone I live. Yet. Taken together with the two products or such used explained. And sometimes. There are secondary effects such as reactive. Or Freitas. So if we look at the environmental cycle of someone else. We can see that many animals carry someone else. So there's wildlife. There's production animals and. If they have salmonella in their intestines they will multiply it. And through the foetus it will get into. Yeah into the environment and into the water system. Also there are many animal exotic animals. That carry. Salmonella such as now. For instance turtles. Or order a few billions or reptiles. They can also be consumption. Through. You know through. Contaminated water. And it can also get the disease. The production animals. Are used for the production of meat and that can also be useful to where there is transmission. Of salmonella. And then. If the food is not cooked properly. Or is there is cross contamination from raw products we scoop products. You can get the disease. They can also be. Contamination through defector E.. For instance this fatty type of food like chocolate. And it can also be contamination also through contaminated water. Of your fish of all sorts of products. So film or a groups. Have to be very careful that we know that young children. If they have these tiny pets may be exotic animals. And they like to give them little Christmas. But it actually is a high risk of outbreaks of. Of salmonella. So someone I like can also be very persistent when it's. Present in for instance a food factory. And then we call it a House floor or. So House Flora. And that means that. Through cleaning and this infection. This someone else. Can remain. And then contaminate the next batch. It can also persist in the stables where it's for instance their presence in insects. Such as beetles use beetles they they stay in these chicken houses in the roof or in the walls. When the chickens are taken out. The Beatles remain in there may be cleaning and infection. But because they are in the insulation material. They are not touched. And then when there's new groups of chicken scatting into the stable. They may be contaminated by the Beatles that are also returning into a stable. So low contamination of ready to eat food. Is also a problem we saw Monella. There was a recall of. Contaminated chocolate with someone Elad type. Montevideo. And actually the source of the contamination of the chocolate was a leaking water pipe. In two thousand and twelve we had a large outbreak of. Contaminated salmon. With some in Iowa. In that case there were quite a lot of people ill more than a thousand people ill. And a source was actually really useable plateaus it for only conveyor belts. And they re contaminated. New batches. All the time. And there was also an outbreak in two thousand and fourteen. Where someone I was related to sprouts. And probably through contaminated water. To produce. There's. Some analysts also often related to the presence in X. and she can then X.. If laying hen is positive for someone else. It might also. Transferred. Transferred his efforts into the X.. So this is a research that was carried out to see what happens with someone I learned during boiling off the eggs. So these eggs were terminated. Artificially contaminated with salmonella. And the salmonella is were allowed to grow for a while and then these eggs were heated. World. During several times. And what you could see that after boiling for four minutes. When Still the whites. In the yolk. Was a bit liquid. There were still dead to six. Someone else left. And then. A different time point. They were also checked again. You could see that there was then. We duck session. Into the fifth then to the fourth. And after seven minutes. And longer. We couldn't find any someone else anymore. And this is exactly. At the time that a yoke. Is really become solid. So if you want to serve. World X. for the Yo piece. It's smart to make sure that they're both long enough so that the yolk is actually sort it. So what are the preventive measures against someone else in the supply chain. We can prevent infection at the farm. We can do some hygiene measures such as. Make sure that the animals are separated from the outside and. Also make sure you provide someone alive free feed. These measures are actually working very well. We see in the last years that there's really a reduction of someone else in the chickens. If there's someone at a present. It's also possible to try to limit the spread of contamination. By for instance giving these chickens. Bacteriophages against someone else. These bacteria phages will kill the salmonella in the gut. They were. Not Kill all the. Someone else but maybe. The level is getting down low enough for you to prevent infection. You can also do channeling. And that means that you keep the contaminated flux. Separate from that time and I did flux and then. Don't tell that is wrong meat. Just used that as processed or heated. Meat. You can also do just exploratory that means that you keep the. Contaminated flocks. Yeah and slaughter those at the end of today. So first slaughter. Someone at a negative flux. And then by the end of the day. Used to the slaughterhouse forty. Someone has a contaminated flocks. Of course it's also important that we have a very good said general hygiene in. Factory and then retail and. The should also be a good. Heating. Of their role meat. A both at retail and also at the catering and. Again. The consumer should also prepare the food. In a good way. So in summary. For someone else. We've seen that it's so ubiquitous pathogen it's everywhere. We see that the environmental cycles are very hard to break. But we can also see that. With good hygiene practices. You can reduce the number of someone else. And if you combine it with proper preparation and storage. And this will reduce the number of infections caused by these pathogens.",

                "text": "This clip. Is about a city. Is belonging to the group of the entry of bacteria C.. It's a gram negative rot. And it has many flagella. And that makes it a very multi-layered organism. It's a metaphor organism which means it can grow in a broad range of temperatures. From eight to forty five degrees and. Sent a great. And its effect a lot of and a rope so it can grow with and without oxygen. Everybody has this is a color in their intestines it's usually harmless inhabitance intestines of humans but also of animals. And therefore it's also used as indicator organisms for hygiene production but also for fecal contamination. But there is a small group of. Eco lice that are pathogenic. That they can cause disease such as eco lie or one five seven eight seven. So he said. Better genic Ecole I can be divided into several groups. For instance the. E.-Tec and the IPAC. Which cause traveler's diarrhea. But I would like to put some special focus on the last one is least the egg and try humor. Eco light. It's called. Bloody diarrhea. And has led to remake syndrome. Here we can see that the effect is also sometimes called. Aesthetic. She got talks in producing. Eco light. And it's also sometimes called. The tech genic called Eye and. Valan example is this take a one five seven H seven. What happens is that this. Other chin when it's in the gut. It produces the toxin. So called she got toxin. And you only need a few cells to. Yeah the cost is deceased. And if we look at this intestinal cell. We see an intestinal cell with micro Feeley. You can see when it's actually the micro freely. So they get shorter. And also the stocks and when it's produced it gets into the cells and then it goes into the system. Of the person that has as having is. Infection. And then is to talk to him is actually going into the system in. The kidneys and causing this. You may let it. Remixing run. And that's a very acute liver kidney disease which can be even lethal. Also carries a bloody diarrhea. An incubation time is a few days. But it can also be. About three weeks. If you want to check where it is eco lice present. Then you can check for interest in farm animals. And it was found that a most important. Farm animal. To carry this pathogen. Would be the cow. You can see it in about ten percent. Of of the examined samples. Is pathogen was present. It's also present. In some of the coughs. And also in sheep and lambs. Basically. And you can see that the other animals that were tested they were not so very highly contaminated with these eco like. So the cow is probably the major source for this. Bacteria. And so what happens for instance during slaughter pathogen can come out of the intestines and maybe contaminate the meat. And then if the meat is not prepared properly. You can get the deceased through the people. Through the meat. Also the cow. Or the milk of the cow. Can be contaminated through the fetus and then if the milk. Again is eaten or drunk during draw. Then you can also get the disease. For the milk. The pathogen will also be present in the in the fetus and through that. Maybe in the manure or maybe in contaminated water. And that transmission route towards food affected balls. And then again. If they are eaten raw. That's also a good way to you know to get this disease. Not a transmission route. Will be through direct contact. And this is especially the case. In young children who might be going to petting zoos. And then. Yeah contaminate themselves. Maybe with tiny fecal matter. Of these of these contaminated. Animals and. That way also contaminate themselves. E-coli I own one five seven is also the course of hamburger disease. But first let's talk about this a one five seven H seven. This notation for eco light. It is the Sera type of these eco light. So it's a kind of. Soap type of. Eco like. And this is based on the N.T. genes that are present on the outside of the bacterium. So the O.N.T. gen is the life of polysaccharides. That are on the outside. And the. Age and the gen. They are the fragile are proteins. And we've seen in the fluffy eco like it that used showed it to have many for a Gela presence. Well going back to the hamburger disease. It has been found there and the Seacole I can suffice for quite a long time. In the beef children really care which is a raw meat product. Can keep this. President for more than seven days. Also fermented sausages. Can be a source of this eco light where they can survive for several weeks. And frozen. Minced beef. Can also keep this better chicken. A life for several months even. And we have seen that many animals. May have this better general common inhabitant and that makes it difficult to eradicate. And that means that the prevention. We should look for for a good. Heating of the meat. Make sure that you don't eat your hamburger in a raw state. Like you can see in this picture. If you heated thought only. Also the core of the hamburger. There's really no problem if you don't have to work for oil. And it's also important to educate. The consumer for that. Of course. But not only hamburgers are of course of the disease. We've also had a large outbreak of E. coli I won all four X. four in Germany. In two thousand and eleven. Where we had many cases almost fourth. Thousand cases people. Falling in ill from this better chance. And actually there were fifty three people who were killed. And it was difficult to find the source of these of these better units first they thought it was cucumbers. But finally they found the source. And they. They estimated it would be in the sprouts a fin a Greek seeds. And if you sprouts were used as a decoration. In salads and on the scent which is also not her. Non-food or non meat related. If you call was found and it was contaminated water crisis in the United Kingdom. In two thousand and thirteen. Because we've seen so much. Outbreaks related to direct contacts transmission. There were rules. Put up by the Dutch government. And it's called. The Dutch hygiene code for pet farms. And that means that there has to be. And yeah a warning. Near the entrance. Stating that if children are getting in contact with the animals if they stroke the animals or pet them that they wash their hands. And that they should also not eat. Within the paddock where the animals are present. Also there are special brushfires to rush their. Their shoes. So that they won't take any of these fecal droppings home. So in summary. About eco life. We've seen that are actually two groups within this group. And that's the major group. Is quite harmless. Everybody has an eco right. In their intestines. But there is a small group. That is pathogenic. And it has a low dose response relationships where you only need a few cells to cause to disease. And we've also seen that. For prevention. It's very important that you heat your food. Your meat very thorough early. And also that you. Of course practice good hygiene. So with respect to water or contaminated water. But also with respect to touching. Pets.",

                "text": "We will talk about foodborne fire assess. What our fire says they are totally different from materia. Actually they're very small. They can be twenty five to three hundred nanometers. And they actually only consists of D.N.A. or R.N.A.. You can see here. Are in a reptile into proteins. And then surrounded by a protein shell. Which we call caps it. There's no metabolism in there. So they cannot multiply by themselves. They really need the host. To multiply. That also means that they cannot grow in food. It just remain there. And maybe they are. Yeah they are very resistant. And maybe they will be killed. Maybe he treatment. Fires that are very host specific. So that means that they can only grow in. One type of organism. The ones that grow in humans. May not be able to grow. In for instance the couse. The way they look at me you're different here you can for instance see an awful mix so far which is causing influenza. But in the bottom row you can see the B. corn our fire assists and the police the fire assists. And these are actually the ones that are mostly related to food. And this is illustrated. In this table. This table is showing the pathogens that are identified in outbreaks in cases involving food workers. And what you can see in this column R.T. agent. And here the number of outbreaks and the number of cases. And you can see that fire agents. Actually cause. Sixty percent of the food borne. Outbreaks. Whereas bacteria. They only. Consist of thirty four percent of the cases. And if we look within the group of the viral agent. That we can see that not all farmers. Actually the most important one. Causing foodborne illness. Thirty three. Maybe thirty four percent of all the outbreaks. Are caused by norovirus. And another important food fire risk. Is hepatitis A virus which causes about ten percent of the outbreaks. So we have a norovirus which is part of the clip before our fire is family. Very tiny Yeah. Viruses. They cause guest orange right. Formatting and diarrhea is a common symptoms include Beijing time. Is quite common for food morning fiction's. So an average twenty four hours. Although it can be a little bit shorter or a little bit longer. The duration of the disease is very short. Especially in healthy adults. It will be one to two days. And unfortunately. It's not possible to fix an eight against these fires. Because it's so very able. It's not possible to develop a vaccine. What's also important to remember is that. You only need a very low dose of these pathogens. To be able to get sick. Only ten one to ten particles are enough to cause the disease. So how does this norovirus. Get to us. Well actually. If we start with a human person. Human. That has a norovirus infection. To multiply this virus in the intestines. And they will be leaving the body. With the feet. So that means that one human. Can I can contaminate. Other humans. Through the direct. Fecal oral. Route. So these fetus will also go through to which they can complain. Up to twenty eight to ten to ten virus particles per gram foetus gets into the sewage. And then into the sewage system. Maybe the numbers a little bit reduced. But not all viruses are killed in the sewage street. Plants. So he ends up in the water in a surface water. And then. A person can get in touch with service water. And can be contaminated with this virus. If we use this water. Also. For instance for irrigation. Of fruit or vegetables. There's also way to contaminate. This fruit and vegetables. Maybe also just water. If it's very near to the coast. Can be used to gulch or. Shell fish and shellfish. Actually concentrate the forest inside their Yeah. Their flesh inside their meat. And that. Yeah. In that case if then the shellfish are not heated properly. You can also get these back to the humans. And then. If we go back to the human. If this person is through the hens. Maybe not working to hygienic really contaminating. Any type of food that you can think of. That is not receiving. Heat treatment. Then you can also contaminate. Many other products. And in that way. Contaminate. Other people. So this is the contamination cycle of moral virus. I think go to the other important food borne virus Hepatitis A virus. We see that they are from a different family. Because I know if I was family. But you can see that they look basically the same. They are very small tiny pharmacist. This far less. Course is a different type of the cease. It's an invasive five S. which means that it really gets into the body. Doesn't stay in the intestines but it goes through the barrier. Into the body. And that it causes. Hepatitis. So liver information. And you can see some of the symptoms are written down here. The incubation time of this virus. Is really very long it can be two to six or even in some cases. Eight weeks time. And that makes it very difficult to get to trace back. What type of food. Was actually responsible for this. Now for this infection. Can you remember what you ate. Six weeks ago. I couldn't. So the duration of the disease is a bit longer had days of quite severe symptoms. So it can be up to eight weeks. But luckily. There is fiction nation possible. So if people are coming from areas where Hepatitis A is not really present. Travel to the Magariaf. Then it's possible to take a fixed nation. And if we are considering the infection route. They are very similar to norovirus. That we just explained. Fires just are also very special. In the way. You can you Turman. Because you cannot culture fires like Victoria on a better dish. You have to do it in a different way. In some cases. You can actually. Culture fire assist in tissue culture system where you use human cell lines to reproduce the virus and that works for hepatitis a virus. But it does not work for human norovirus. So there's no good goal to your system yet. For culturing human or a virus. I will come back to that. Another way to check for the presence of fires this would be. Electron Microscopy. So here you can see an electron microscope big picture. Of norovirus. This only works if you have many cells present. So it could work. If you want to detect. The patient and you can collect the fetus. What are many farmers particles present. Then you would be able to use the electron microscope. But in food. There will be very low number of the Mike Walker. Mission present. So yeah it's not possible to use this method. Then immunological methods. Using. Specific antibodies for instance a license. They also work for viruses but also only. For patient material. Not for food. Because a number. Number of viruses are again too low. So the best way to check for fire assist. Would be. D.N.A. techniques. For instance in the first. Transcriptase P.C.R. method. In case of these a lot of fires and hepatitis. A forest as. Are in a present. So first you have to get to refers to. Transcript a step. To get back to D.N.A.. And then you can use the P.C.R. machine. To multiply D.N.A. and then maybe you can find the bands. Of the norovirus or if you use a cue P.C.R. you can get the increase of. Fluorescence immediately. See the results. So these are the best way only. We have to remember that if we use D.N.A. techniques. We have no clue about. If the fires are still effective. We can see we can find our ne very specifically. But we cannot know. If they are really effective. So what they do if they want to examine a treatment. To get rid of fire assists. Is that they use. What they call surrogate fire assess surrogate fire resource for human. Norovirus. And in this craft there are two types. Use the feline. Alyse forest. And you mewling norovirus. They are both animal farmers just very much like human or of fire risk. For which we have culture system. So what Joan in this graph. Is the decimal reduction time so it's to devalue in relation to different temperatures. And then you can see that the M. and free fire is if the temperature increases the defense. Fairly quickly. Gets very low. And that means that if it's very low. It only takes a short time. To reduce the pharmacist. So we can see that that's sixty five degrees. Both feel likely as far as and you run norovirus have a very low do you feel you know. So at these temperatures. Already the fire was just getting. Yeah. Down quickly. But what we have to consider. While we interpret these type of data. Is that we have to be careful with extrapolation of these results. To human or all virus. Because we cannot be one hundred percent sure that it's exactly the same case. For you menorah fires as well. But it's a strong indication that we can use these data. So what can we do to prevent norovirus infections. Well we have to make sure that we use in contaminated water. So there's no fire risk build up inside for instance shellfish or. Irrigation water. That contaminates fruit. He also have to make sure that there's a good hygiene presence. Especially with respect to food workers because footwear because they can just. Contaminate. Any type of food. If that's not heated anymore. Then. Yeah. You have a risk. And you also have to consider the fact that food workers. If they have a disease. And they have recovered and they have don't have any symptoms anymore. They can still. Excrete the pharmacist's in their fetus. So to have to be very strict with applying. All the hygiene rules with hand washing. And all that kind of. Important measures. For them or. If it's possible. They should be heating. Of the products especially shellfish in some countries they are eaten raw but that's not very Weiss. From a virus point of view. So in summary. We have seen that viruses are. Interest settler pathogens. They can be a major cause of food borne disease. Furthermore we can prevent them. By using and contaminated water. We have to make sure. If it's possible to have a thorough heating step. But in case of faery for child. Fruits like these robberies. And it's of course not possible. And we have to make sure that we have apply. All the hygiene rules.",

                "text": "We will talk about transmission routes of food borne diseases. In general. Effort in transmission its people and on the ecology. Of the microorganism. Order reservoir. Where the pathogen. Is present. So to night it's a source of the microorganisms and. The way these pathogens are transmitted. Is dependent on. For instance where. Where do they cost a disease. For instance respiratory pathogens. They are usually transmitted through the air. And in the case of. And to make better chance what we will be talking about in these. Food microbiology. Course. That's usually transmitted through the oral route. And if the host. Can multiply the best. You're usually talking about fecal oral. Route. In that case. There will be a spread through the fetus. Into the environment. And then. Through the environment or through the fetus. There's a further transmission. And this can be directly. For instance from host to host. Men to man. Or maybe from animal to man can be packs it can be farm animals. But it can also be in it. In direct routes. And then. It's through or. Vector or fall mites and fall mites are for instance. A kitchen utensils. Or it can also be betting material Leinen. Things like that and it can also be transmitted through water contaminated water. Usually fecal contaminated water or. Through food. So a typical rest far better chance. Is the animal got. In this example you can see the chickens. Because chickens. They are healthy carriers. Of the pathogen. The human pathogen can protect or they just have these pathogens. In their gut. They don't fall ill. But they can multiply disposition. And they can spread. The best that you can through a fetus. Into the environment. And we know that one gram of fetus. Chicken fetus. Can actually contain more than one million. Of pathogens. So if we want to prevent. Environmental transmission. We have to make sure that we separate. Fecal. Parts. From. Yeah. The normal life. And also we have to be careful that we don't use contaminated water. Don't reuse. Waste water. Or make sure that you purified water. Before you use it. So to separate fecal fecal streams from normal life. There are sewage systems. And this is has already been done. Like in Greek islands. Two thousand years before Christ. Whereas in Western European capitals. We only have a good sewage system. Since one thousand nine hundred. Beginning of the twentieth century. And that actually. When these systems were applied. The number of infections. Was greatly reduced. If we have transmission. Via direct contact. That can be direct contact for instance with pet animals. We know that especially young animals such as kittens and puppies. They can have high numbers of pathogens. In their intestines and also in their fetus. So in that way they can be transmitted directly to humans. Or maybe also some other animals such as. Animals that you may not think about. Like in fifty and stay can be very good source of. Someone else for instance. And also from humans to humans. Ill humans can easily. Contaminate other humans. That can be for instance and they care centers. But also in areas where people are living close together such as nursing homes and hospitals. Transmission fire. In direct contact. Is for instance. Fire factors. In effect or. Is an agent. It carries and transmits an infectious pathogen. To other. Organisms or. Directly to food. For example we can think about mice and rats. They can transmit. Better Chance. But also for instance. Insects. You can see in this light you can see. It's also in these beetles they live in chicken houses where they go into the roof system. When the chickens are taken out for slaughter. And then the stable is Clinton is affected. And there's a new batch of chickens coming in and then the temperature gets warmer. In the stable. And then you'll be toast I will come down from the roof. And maybe they carry pathogens and then. We have a transmission route. And you can also think about amoeba. Or other types of parasites. Transmitting bacterial diseases. So to prevent these type of transmission. We have to prevent access of rodents and insects to production sides. But also in processing. Areas and. Also areas where there's preparation and. Where the waste is treated. So if we think about food borne transition through plants. Because think about the culture of these plants. Of course we have to make sure that there is a clean. Irrigation water. And also. If you are. Manure if used as a fertilizer. You have to make sure that there are no pathogens anymore. Also we have to use. Clean water. If we want to wash. Food. You can imagine that. If you wash the. Food in just in a river. It's not a very good way. Or not a very safe way to wash the food and. Yeah and to transmit disease. There are also other food borne routes through. For instance the animals the production animals. You can imagine that if these production animals especially in bio industry. They lift very close together. They are really into. Good contact. And that means they can also through this contact. Transmitted Diseases to each other and then. If only one animal. Contaminated in the beginning. Then at the end. Maybe the whole stable. Is contaminated. Also it's slaughter. That can be contamination cross contamination maybe. If the intestines are taken out of the animal. And they're a little bit damaged. Then you can imagine that any bacteria present in the intestines. Will spread out over the meat. Over the carcass. And maybe also over. Equipment. And in that way. Under carcasses can also be contaminated. And finally had to read till. Also cross contamination. Yeah yeah. Very important to keep in mind that. No cause contamination of raw products. And processed products. Is taking place. So if we look at the possibility of amplification. Across contamination it's also very important. So if we keep again. The. Example in our minds of the slaughterhouse that maybe there are some animals coming in only twenty five percent of the animal. Was originally contaminated. Then maybe through to handling or. Cross contamination. At the end of the slaughter. One hundred percent of the animals or of the meat. Is contaminated. Of course you want to prevent that. And another thing to keep in mind when thinking about possible terminations is that we have to make sure that there's a core act. Time and temperature. During storage or during processing. Maybe you can have in activation. At a very high temperature. And maybe you can keep the growth. Get to a low level. If the temperature is low enough. But there's a high so weird I might be. Growth possible. So these are all things to consider. To prevent transmission. Of pathogens. So in summary. We have learned that are different types of transmission routes. That can be environmental. It can be through food. And it can also be through direct or indirect contact. And we have also learned about prevention. You have to try to separate the different parts of food. So that we can keep out the better chance. Also if possible. We also can do. Like treatments like he treatments for instance. To get to in activates any possible pathogens present. And also in the case of. Transfer and across and cross contamination. We have to try to prevent. Amplification.",

                "text": "I'll give you an introduction to foodborne illnesses. These illnesses will be restricted to. Illnesses caused by microorganisms. So we will not talk about chemical like metals and things like that or. Dioxins just. Microorganisms or toxins produced by microorganisms. And these diseases are caused by. What we call pathogens and breath agents can be. Bacteria or viruses or parasites or L.-G. or Also fungi in that case mice mostly there will be. Toxins produced by fungi. So we can discriminate. Two types of food borne diseases. I will be. Food borne. Intoxication. Which we can see here. The toxin. It's already in the word. Food borne intoxication. And the other group of food borne disease will be. Infection and infection. We will have. Microorganisms in the food. There are differences. Very much differences in these types of diseases. For instance. The time that it takes to become ill. There will be in the case of the intoxication. It will be very quickly from zero to twelve hours and it can even be within thirty minutes. In the case of an infection. It will take a little bit longer. Maybe eight to twenty four hours. Twenty four hours is actually quite common Everett's. For Food borne infection. But it can also be longer it can even take months before a person gets ill. After consumption of the food and to get a food borne in infection. So in the case of an intoxication. You need. Many cells. To get enough oxygen to cause a disease. And in the case of an infection. The number of cells to cost effective. Can be low or high. And that is very much dependent on the type of organism. Can be different for different strains or it can be different for different species. And also the symptoms. Are different in the case of an intoxication. It's usually. High up in the history or intestinal tract. So there will be nausea and vomiting. As the major symptoms. In the case of the food borne infection. It's a bit lower in the guests or we've just not tracked. And you will have. Abdominal pain. And diarrhea. And the time that the. Persons are ill. So the deceased. Is usually quite short in the case of an intoxication. Maximally one day. And in the case of an affection. It can be long or can be. One two three days. As an effort. But it can also take weeks. And it can even take months. So these differences an incubation time. Are illustrated in this graph. You can see a long list of different causes of food borne disease. And you can see. Incubation time. On the X. axis. So what you immediately notice is that there's one group. Over here with very short. Incubation time. So and these are all. Food borne intoxications. And then we have a large group. With a bit longer incubation time. Can see that here. It's about twenty four to forty eight hours. That's a very average. Incubation time for food borne infections. But there's one exception. And that is here to be still serious. That's also. Food borne intoxication. Only it takes a little bit longer than the average intoxication it can take up until one day. For a person to get ill. And then we have a group of microorganisms ready. Incubation time is a little bit longer. For instance in Camp Le Victor. Incubating time. Is three days but it can be up to seven days. And they're also. Some other microorganisms that. Have longer into Beijing time. And these are listed in the bottom of the slight. You can read it here. So there's also differences in those response relation. And that means. The different strains. Need different. Number of cells to cause a disease. In this graph. You can see here. Take rates. In the percentage of. Ill people. First the dose. And the dose. Is expressed in luck. So if you and look see if you means that if there's a to here. That means that it's ten to the power to. So one hundred cells. So if there's a six here. What would be the number. You calculate that. That will be ten to the power sixty. So one million cells. So what we see in this graph. For instance if we look at the red line that Eco light. A one five seven line. We can see that fifty percent of the people get ill. After a dose of two point one. So a little bit more than one hundred cells it's a very low number of cells. Already causing a disease. And if we look for instance at the line of that someone island that's on the blue line. We can see that fifty percent of the people get ill. After consumption of ten to the five point five which is a little bit more than three hundred thousand cells. So it's really a lot more. So this illustrates the differences in those response relationship between different strains in different species. Also differences in how susceptibility are very important. If you're talking about food borne disease. Most susceptible. Audio piece. And you know P.. Is an acronym for the young. Old you pregnant. And immunocompromised people. Why are they more susceptible. Well. That can be. Because for instance in the case of young babies. They might be in a winning states. They don't get breast milk anymore so they loosed. The immunity of the mother. And they may be exposed to normal types of food. And also maybe to water. Types of infections. Or maybe toxins. Also you can imagine if a person is malnourished. They are also more susceptible to disease. And also people that are in a high stress. They are also more susceptible. And not a thing is in you know compression. Suppression. Immunosuppression is happening for instance in cancer patients who are taking radiotherapy. Or chemotherapy. And this really reduces their immune system. Also in the case of organ transplant receivers. They also get drugs. That really suppress the stary immune system. To make sure that the organs are not rejected. But in that case. They are more susceptible to. Food borne diseases. And also expirations. They also have a lower. Immune system. Then if we look at the stomach. Stomach is actually our first defense. Into the. Yeah. Battle against it. Infections. Because of the low ph of the stomach. So in this graph you can see the Ph. After a consumption of a meal. The edge is normally very low. But after we consume food. The PH gets higher because our food normally has a higher PH. And then the entire our stomach will produce gastric S. it. Which will then make sure that the PH is going down again and that is what you can see in this graph. So that their Ph. After consumption of a meal. In time. And the green line. Shows the line for young adult people. So you can see that the PH is going down down down below the level of four. Which is considered to. Be the minimal level. To get really good. Reduction of pathogens in the in the stomach. And it takes about thirty minutes. If we look at the gray line. It's line for the elderly people. We can actually see that it takes much longer to get to this level of about for. It takes about a little bit more than one hour. So it takes more than two times. To get through these low Ph. And in the meantime there's an increased chance of survival of the pathogens. But also maybe of adaptation. What we can also see. Is that at the end. There's still a difference in Ph. Of younger. And all of people. So this illustrates the fact a difference in Filner ability also of. Older and younger people because of the PH comic. So in summary. We have learned that there are some microorganisms that are able to cause disease. We call them better chance. We know to tear or two types of diseases that can result. That can be food borne. Infections and food borne. Intoxications. We have seen that the chance of illness. Is very much dependent on the type. And the dose of the pathogen. And we've also seen at some consumers. The you know piece. Or more from rable. An article Schumer's.",

                "text": "Welcome to of course. Food microbiology. The coming weeks you are going to learn a lot of things on food microbiology. My name is Hayden Bester and a new coordinator of the course. The coming weeks you going to study. Dark urines. A significance of microorganisms in food. You're going to study the good the bad. And the ugly guys. The good microorganisms are used to ferment our foods. The best microorganisms. You can make us ill. And they have all of relevance for food safety. And the ugly microorganisms. These can spoil our products and our relevance for food quality. In the weeks of fermentation you going to learn how fermented foods. Are better in taste. And health from intake you can also extend their shelf life. And how health aspects are influenced by the film Taishan processes. You're going to learn a lot on food borne pathogens. The curia. Ferris's and parasites. And also think I would say producing toxins. Can make. As ill because also going to learn about spoilers organisms but they're used and malt. They can all spoil our food. You're going to use and chain wide approach. Microorganisms. Can be transmitted. Along the food chain and you're going to learn which factors influence their growth and which factors influence are in it is ation. And how you can control transmission. In a food chain. And also in our own kitchen you can see the course schedule. In the first four weeks. My colleague Professor Masters featuring will introduce you to the quality of food. Which factors do influence spoilage What factors influence growth. And it is a shit. And then after these first four weeks. I call it professor at the. It will continue. He will continue on the positive expresso. Aspects of food quality. Fermentation. And Week five and week six and then on week seven by quality B.M.I. has a later. Introduce you to food borne illnesses. And she also discuss. Forests. And then every eight. You have your midterm exam. You know mitten exam. Topics discussed in week one two seven. Will be reviewed. And then after your midterm exam. In week nine to eleven. You continue would have food to borne pathogens. Your mass later of all discussed a gram negative bacteria. The parasites. And algae. And then I will continue on a gram positive booked area. And then any Smit The discussed fungi which are able to be used to mega toxins. And then after week. Eleven starting in week twelve. I will discuss transmission. In the kitchen. And then my colleague Martin and I will continue and he will discuss control. How can we control transmission. And she will discuss aspects. On hygiene and aspects and sampling. And then finally you will have your examination. After examination. The lead classes will start a half later I myself will come to Singapore. To meet your dare. And to guide you in the practical course he should have pictures of the different teachers. Professor muscles retuning. He will be teaching on spoiler its. Roles. Notification. And also quantification. Quantification of. Rolf and quantification of innate efficient. Professor at least MIT you'll be teaching one fermentation. A maggot talks in producing things you'll know has a neighbor is teaching one. Food borne illnesses. As well as myself. I also teaching on food borne illnesses. Seal discuss the hygiene. Cleaning in this infection. And also met its feel used to examine. Food. All the teachers. Have made an introduction clip for you which you can find on blackboard. You have prepared. A Couple Of course material for you. First of all. You have to buy the book written by Emma Morse. Which is called food. Microbiology next to that. Be made in digital learning environment. Which is organized. There a week. And there you can find per week. To different knowledge clips. But also you find some additional learning materials. Next to the book of Edom and most. You also need to study some additional learning materials. And this is posted on blackboard. You also made. They get to exercise for you. Is help you. These will help you to practice your new knowledge. And we also made books. Per week you find a student to student book. And there you can post your questions and you college students. Can answer your questions. And he also made a life contact our book. He you can post questions. Before we have to live contact our and. We really would appreciate that you will make use of that. This is a screenshot of the course schedule. Starting a week one. In general area. And you see different names off the cliffs. This will be covered in the thirst week. And also when you have the life contact hour and basically every Friday afternoon. If you have the live Court of the hour. Scheduled. Half past four. And then in the first column you see the study material. And this is referring to the chapters. Of the ED and most book. And you also see that you have some extra material. The E. for Extra. And this case on history. But some chapters you don't have to study you just have to read. And therefore you see the word read wooden brackets. So these things you don't have to study. It just for some extra It gives you some extra. Background information. As a mentioned. You may digital exercises for you and these exercises give you feedback. Or not correct answers. And also to correct answers. And then finally. You will have your exit assessment. You have to complete the exercises. But they won't be great it. And then the lead up classes which count for twenty five percent. But you're left the group. Practical Rupe. You will write a report. And a minimal requirement for dead in five point five. And then a written exam. We have two types. As I already mentioned the midterm exam. It's gone for fifteen percent. And the final exam. It's count for sixty percent. And they will be both waited. So for questions on the organization or on the practical course you can always email me. And on behalf of all my colleagues. I wish you a very warm welcome to the course. Food. Microbiology.",

We made for you. A fact sheet. Would summarize all the important details. It's a lot of information. I'm going to explain it to you for you step by step. You have been discussing. Nine different food borne pathogens. Some are gram positive. And all those Phil Gramm negative. The mythology was different. Most of them what shape. For example can put a better. As a spiral shape and also three of them were able to forms force. This is a serious. Mostly imperfect tense and costly in both the line and. They were able to quote a food borne intoxication. Or food borne infection. Divergence. Is different for different packages. For some. You just need a few cells to get sick. Especially the kempler better. And Eco life. For all those who need a much higher dose. To get sick. And most of them are not able to grow in a fridge. Only listeria most of the news. Is able to grow. Well in the fridge. If the age range varies microbes to grow. Brains from about five to eight. The S.S. specially for eco Larry. You have an couple of trains. Which have a low. B. AIDS minimum. Most of them are also facultative. Anaerobic are able to grow in the absence and presence of oxygen. It can pull back to its micro. I would feel like it. Torrent. A bit of oxygen. But some of them are even. Arabic organism. It was Liam. Birth events. It was suitable to line up these two are. Anaerobic organisms. Most of the organisms do survive. Well. At the surface. But some of them are sensitive to dry. Especially Campbell a better deal and is better since you can find in different sources. And you see a couple of sources. Listed over here. If they are present in different sources. They can also be in different products. And that's actually what you see here. Who see different signals. A symbol of. Plus. Means that it can be present there. Plus plus it's a rather high chance. Is present in these kinds of foods. Mine is that the chance is not that high. And a minus minus means that it's a very. Occasion. That you find it organism. In these kind of foods. So you are again. You see the whole fact sheet and. All the details listed here. You should be able to know. In order to understand. What kind of organisms. To cause what kind of illnesses. And also what kind of foods are associated with what kind of organisms.",

                "text": "India is not a cliff. You go to talk about transmission. Of food borne pathogens in our kitchen. With fit factors do influence their transmission. And what kind of effect or to influence their survival. But first of all. You recall that. Think you bring home. Can make you ill. Our own pets. But also our process and our. Unprocessed food all these or all these problems can be positive for food borne pathogens. Today I'm going to talk about. Transmission in the kitchen. I'm going to illustrate it would've following example. In our laboratory. We fish a life for this mission in the kitchen. By using and chicken. As an example. So what did we do we used a powder to wrap. The surveys. Of and chicken. And this is a special power. Because it becomes fluorescent. When you expose it to you feel light. As the powder. Our food borne pathogens. Like someone else. And it is what you see then. So this is the chicken. And wrapped wood. The powder. And this you all these white. What you see. Are some money to make a cell that you go on to prepare. This chicken. And also go to prepare a salad. It's vegetables. But first we're going to prepare the chicken. So we go to cut the chicken. On a cutting board. So that what you see here. You see that you can relax. On the cutting board. But now. Our cutting board. Is also contaminated. Then we want to wash our hands. And therefore. We also contaminated. Our think. Then we going to cut our federal bust. Remember on the cutting board. We also have used. To cut the chicken. And then. We have made our sell it. But our whole salad is contaminated. So this. Illustrated that. When food. Gets contaminated. You can also contaminated. I'm contaminated food. So what factors influence transmission. First of all. Wetness organisms need. Like Us. It whatever to survive. And if there's if this. Surface is dried. Organism. You'll die. And also if there is a bit of food debris. It gives them. Protection. They will better survive. On the surface. You're able to measure transmission of organisms. By using a robotic plate. And that's actually what you see here. Transmission. Depends on free things. Contact time. The pressure. And also the type of. Organism. What you see. Over there is a picture of a rolled up plate. And actually it's a kind of petri dish. You know a battery just. Often feels real layer of agar. But this is a special Petri this because now we used more Agar. And so. The edge. And now if you turn around. The petri dish. You're able to sample the surface. And that's actually what we did in our laboratory. This did here shows you the effect of time. On amount of cells which are able to detach. And you see as Times continues. The ute. Is higher. Also when the pressure is higher. More organism. Will detect. But it also depends on the type of organism. South Coast or us. Is growing as a cluster of cells. So you can imagine it is easily. More easily to to to detach. These organisms. Someone their law. Has all kinds of sin breed. Around is an embrace. And often these cells they detects very firm. At a surface. Can put a better is a very sensitive organism to drive this because shows you the survival of different pathogens. On a stainless steel tree. This figure. But the plea for stuff was already us. On the Y. axis you see the number of cells. First squared. One hundred centimeters. And here are the surviving times in our US. First to have a record. Decline. And then. A fraction of the population. Us. Survives and a higher initial level. The more survivors you have. So this is the case for stuff because already it's this craft shows the figures of. Someone else. You see these organisms. Decline is much faster. And therefore also. The fraction which is able to survive. Is lower. Complete better. Is a very sensitive organism. And in this case. You are even able to detect the lowest. Concentration used. So. Contact time pressure. And the type of organism to influence transmission. But also the presence of food. Debris. And that's actually what you measure here. You measure to revive all of listeria. A stainless. You'll trace this one. And at your. Right. Also trace. It a bit of food debris. And what is the sea. This figure shows you the data. Of listeria. In water. And you can see there's a record decline. Over time. But for the trace. Which we have used a bit of food debris. This is vital it's much higher. To summarize transmission and survival. Or food borne pathogens in the kitchen. Try to prevent. Cross contamination. The very importantly clean. The equipment you use to prepare food. And also dry. It's very properly.",

One in six persons to get sick. By food borne pathogens. And this number is expected to increase. Because a number of elderly the increase. And also request you much more minimal processed food. And these foods that are gents have a higher chance to survive. Before and package and can reach the human host. They have been able to survive. Multiple knishes. From soil. To man. And my key question is how can a better gene successfully transmit to the host. In some leases. They will survive. Or grow. And in all those they will die. In only the most robust one will reach the human host. But there are also third ability between strains. How they react. And how robust they are in my view to study ecology of food borne pathogens. You should not only focusing on food. Therefore my approach has been so far to study. Multiple sequential knishes. And I'm looking how do they adapt and is there overlap in the way they adapt. And how first of all is their response. And what are the underlying mechanisms for that. Answers to these questions. Will help us to predict the behavior of food borne pathogens. Based on underlying mechanisms. And then we include for ability. You can also more realistically. We did their behavior. What is my approach. In order to answer these questions. A multiple level approach is needed. And also quantitative approach. Information on the genome level will help us understand how single cells behave. And also how the population as a whole being. If. I don't study their behavior in their natural habitat. From the soil. To men. Because a robust organism. Is able to survive. In all of them. This knowledge.

The first incidents were linked to consumption of sausages. And therefore it's called borderline and goes both to this is Letten. For sausage. Isn't gram positive. Organism and is to be found in soil. And in menu and it's an anaerobic. Organism. It will grow in the presence of oxygen. It's causing in the. Intoxication. It's the toxin produced. Is causing bodily ism. You have different types of talks in A B. and E. and F.. Are mainly associated with human body listen to motivate human. That it binds to the nerves. And. But it talks in is. He'd label. Meaning that and he treatment will inactivate the talks in the symptoms are very severe. Because it's a neurotoxin. It results in blockage of the contraction of mass. The first symptoms are vomiting and nausea. And then people suffering from muscle pain. And double vision. And eventually. It also results in stopping of the beating of the heart muscle. Incubation time. Is twelve to forty eight hours. And duration can range from one to eight days or even longer. And it is easy it's very severe. And around ten percent of the cases. Will die. Strains of course in borderline You can divide into Bigfoots the first group. The first group of strains. I don't put it extends. They will not grow. In the refrigerator. Biddies poorest are very. Heat resistant. Therefore the canning industry. Have introduced a very stringent process. To get rid of these sports. Because in low ESSID foods. As you see it for example they're in these foods. Will see the spores if they're still there. They can grow. And multiply and therefore can't. Foods are heated. At one hundred twenty one degrees Celsius. For free minutes. And this will result in twelve decimal reductions. Of the spores. Making these products save focus review bottom line and the second group. Is a strange the new put it straight. But the strains. They can grow in a refrigerator. But as poor as are a bit less heat resistant. In order to make ready to eat meals save for the sports. These meals. Have to be lead at a ninety degree Celsius. For ten minutes or so in these feet. In these products. No putting strains. Will be inactivated. And these strains. Won't be able to grow because we've stored these foods in the refrigerators. The toxin is the most lethal biological agent we know. On Earth. Please note that is a lock scale. You see in a couple of toxins listed in a leetle dozes you need. For a different toxins. And you can see that they're both alive and toxin. Is the most toxic agent. So what is actually the mode of action. As he said. It's a neuro toxin it binds at the nerves and he you can see the muscle. And here you see the nerves and. Nerved ence includes several. Thousand apps is an easy enough as you have a couple of festivals and FESA goes to contain the neurotransmitter. Which is called as a DIL goal line in order to transmit the signal. Of the nerve to the mast so. This molecule have to be released to the muscle. And what is in a mode of action of the toxin. It prevents fusion. Of the membrane of the vertical. And the membrane. Of the nerve end. How by cutting. The festival associate great. Protein. Or does she naps. Associated protein. So they'll heating a food is very important and therefore carrying at home. Can be dangerous. Because sports can be present on soil. It can also be present on Herb's So when we add Herb's. To oil. Spores can be present. And there are a couple of Al breaks. Linked to consumption of oil which were flavored. But hurts. Because if Herb's are not very dry. Protein with the line I'm getting weaker. It is able to grow. In a little droplet. Of water next to human but it isn't. You also have to even ball to listen. And parents are warned not to feed honey to their young babies. Because babies. They don't have and. You've Elop they'll develop. Intestinal flora. And these pictures show that especially the. Evens. Are susceptible. The very youngest. Interest. Incidence for the furry Young is high. You also have other kinds of bodily isn't a few in both. Caused by the talks in C. and D. but you also might have heard about Botox. Where you inject. Locally. The talks in resulting in not contraction of the muscles. At his place of interest. And also needles of drug users can be contaminated. Resulting in want. Bottle ism. To summarize this food borne. Better than. Proceeding with the line I'm able to produce a little. Neurotoxin. And it's a most lethal biological agent. We know. And to guarantee safe. Products and good can imposes is essential.",

The species can you clarify it in five types you pending on a toxin produced type. Eighty two it's an end or a big organism. But it also just tolerant. A bit of oxygen. It's untypical Misa fell. It's gone growing our refrigerator. But it's a very fast grower. It has the lowest. Generation time compared to all other presidents. Pussy in Beverly hands is causing and talks to go. Infection. Because it's producing toxins. Inside our gut. Not all the strains are able to produce toxin. Five to ten percent of the strains. Do produce the Tocsin When thank did of cells. End up in our intestine. And they've gone to spur late. Then they also go on to produce a toxin. And then up and life is of the cells. To support that. That the display or and also to talks in is released in the gut. Two different types of disease. Are caused or. Especially associated with foods. The first type. Is Type A. People suffering from diarrhea. Noisier. And bellyache. An incubation time. Range from eight to twenty four hours. Because a toxin has to be deuced in the gut. Duration is one to two days. Type C. is. Much more rare. But much more severe. People suffering from severe diarrhea. And also inflammation of the intestine. But how can cause the imperfect tense. Read. Our food. Because it is boys. Is poor form or. It can be present in soil. In water and environment. And therefore it can also be in contaminant. All our food products. Also Elmos can be tested positive for closely in their frequency as he made no meat issue. Is sterile. But Apple slaughtering animals can can get stressed. And then spores. Which are present in the destiny of animals. They can past intestinal. Membrane. And then. Infect meat. So therefore via different routes our foods. Can get contaminated. It was today in perfectly fence. So which foods are associative it is organism. They have in common. They are often prepared. In huge amount. Because it's a spore form or it will survive the eating process. And then there you have a huge sum mount of food. The cooling down process will go through slow and because it's not applies fairly fast. You have in a rather short time. High numbers of organism. And then afterwards you read to put some cells and also especially sports will survive. To summarize coarsely imperfect tense. It's an anaerobic spore farmer. But it won't grow in our refrigerator. But then when we. Abused the temperature. It will grow at a rather high. Full freight. But then we control the temperature in our refrigerator well. It won't be a problem.",

                "text": "In this little clip. I'm going to introduce you to Priscilla serious serious serious. Is a food borne pathogens. And is able to form spores. As you can see at the big you're at your left. It's a gram positive organism. And it has a rod. Shape. It can grow in a presence and absence of Alton because it's a faculty to enter a weak organism. We have different types of trains. Some are able to grow in a Fritz. Cycle tolerance strains. But you also have the feel of straightens. Bacillus Sirius is able to cause. Two types of disease. The first type. Is the Mehta type. In this case. The talks in is produced in the food. And a toxin is called. Syria light. And it's talks in is heat stable. So he treated. He treatment. Doesn't. In activated the talks in. And this toxin especially produce improper. Products which are rich in carbohydrates. They rise. Past that. And pastry. The symptoms of this is us. Are really mout patients all. Often suffer from vomiting and incubate in time is short. First patients get sick after half an hour. To five hours. Because patients are vomiting. They recover also quite quickly. And therefore duration of the disease. Is from six hours to one day. And the symptoms of this intoxication. Are more or less similar to the symptoms caused by staff or iest. And typical scenario. Of an outbreak related to the intoxication. Is when you make food in a very you would. Amount. Like when you're preparing is in the UK where you cook rice spores. Won't be elected faded. And then you prepare a lot of food. Cooling down process. After the cooking process he'll go fairly slowly and he calls goes very slowly. The spores are able to germinate. To grow. And then. To produce to talks in a recall the toxin is he'd stable. So reheating you receive. Afterwards. Just be focused something in your microwave or want to inactivate. To talks in next to the middle. Type the set a series can also produce or cause. They're really a type of disease. Then a toxin is produced in the gut. So not in the food. But in a gut. And products involved. Different types of products. Sources that. Desserts. Dairy. And also meat products. And because a toxin is produced. Inside a body. The symptoms. Before the air rises takes a bit longer. You can base in time range from eight to sixteen hours. Also duration is really rather short from cell for hours to one day. And this type of disease is very similar to the disease caused it was so you can paraffin it. So how can a serious serious make. As ill. Foods. In food sports. Cells and emitted. Tocsin can be present. And up on consumption of the food. The Tocsin in the doxy can cause for meting. Spores and cells. They can survive. Our stomach that it. Especially this poor is because they are really sh resistant. So. Especially this poor us. Will Survive. The better through stomach. And then when we entered it up in the gut. The spores to germinate. Grow out. And their produce. Diarrhea type of talks in. So how gets our food. Them unaided. Because spores are widespread in the environment. They are present in soil. And therefore also on our role. Materials. Thius soil. It can also end up in our animals. And therefore also in our of our of. Our meat products. But next to be a food borne pathogens. The City series is also a spoilage organism. Especially so shouldn't spoil it. Of milk. Because it's actually impossible to prevent contamination. Of spores in milk and. As you know supports a ferry to resistant. So they survive the best recession process of milk. He you see from careful bacillus in milk. Stored at seven degree celcius. After that recession. And you can see visitors' sports. Although initial levels. Are in this case. A bit low. They can grow. At seven degrees Celsius. And therefore spoil the product. But why then the say the series doesn't cause illness is associated with New York. And that's X. three because spoilers you already see but your eyes. Before and love toxin is produced to get you sick. And also busy to serious. Want to do that much toxin. At low temperature. To summarize the say the series. It isn't spore forming. Organism. And it's also in cycle tolerant. Organism. You have a couple strange foods are able to grow in a fridge. And next to being split organism. It can also cause. Illnesses and intoxication. And doxy go into action.",

Inside a cell. And spores are very resistant. They have to be sent to the moon in space shuttle. And they have been returned fireball. But curial form spores. Inside a cell. And that's why they call. And those spores. Next to the Tyria also think they can form sports it's also mean of. Survive. Surviving stress conditions. But also way of reproducing. They form spores. At the end of the food embody. They easily detect. And one then. The environment is favorable. They can germinate. And grow out again. In this knowledge clip I will mainly focusing on the curial spores E.C. cells which are dividing. And then up and need to limitation. But through going to form spores. And that's actually what you see here. Least. You see here in space and sell. We don't support inside. So these cells are spore a lady. And them and spoil ation continues. The mother cell life is. And the spores. Becomes freely available in the environment. Spores are dormant. They are not. Metabolically. Active. The D.N.A. of the spore is protected. In the core. Proteins and minerals. Do protected the unity. Next to dead. Also the spores containers and couple of protective layers. Protecting the core of the cell and spores are very resistant to different kinds of heat. Wet and dry heat there. Occasion. Radiation. And also oxidative gambles. And then when the environment calls favorable spores can break up again. They germinate. And this is actually what you see in the picture below. This is poor. And then when a verb in the course favorable. This poor dehydrate. And that's actually what you see here. They germinate. And grow out until Ansel and then when there's enough nutrients. Cells will divide. A bit when the stress conditions become stressful again. The cells will go into spore allayed. Than first septum is formed inside a cell. And then those poor lation continues. The spore is formed in this cell. And is then released sports. They are widespread in the environment. You can find spores in production environment. But also in soil and therefore also. On raw materials. Because they are so. Stress resistant. They can survive. Minimal processing. They survive. Best recession temperatures. They survive low ph a low water activity. Only in. Foods fits our furry Hajji Did they are. They are safe for sports. For example canned. Products. They are sterilized. And in these products. Sports are not present anymore. But when foods are only mildly processed. Spores can still be present. And then during storage and distribution. Spores can germinate. Grow out. And therefore course. Spoil it and maybe also cause. Food borne illnesses. You have difference poor from us the solicitor list. Is causing spoilers of Brett it's. Able to drape. The inner structure. Of Bret. Is producing and slimy substance there. Next to spoil it organism. Also food want better genes can form sports but see this serious. Proceeding both align them and will see the I'm perfectly hands. Next to food related organism. Also known food related organism can form spores. You might have heard about the Steelers and traces. The sudden traces is forming spores and these spores. Are I haven't used as a weapon in bio terror terrorism and a disease caused by this organism is called anthrax. Also bacillus three hundred is able to form a support us. And these cells. Are able to be doesn't toxin with skills. Insects and therefore spores as you are used as an insecticide. So to summarise sports. Spores. Can be widespread in the environment. And they are resistant to. All kind of trespass. They survive. Minimal processing. Steps. And in these foods. They can grow. Multiply in course spoilage. And also food borne diseases.\n",

                "text": "In this not just clip I'm going to talk about stuff because already it's with is in food borne pathogen. The picture of the left. You see is organism. And why do you see you see an clustering of cells. And that's actually why it's called. Stuff. Caucus. Caucus means. I'm very shape. As the field is Greek. For a bunch of grapes. Staphylococcus isn't gram positive. Organism and in typical maze of fell. It won't grow in our. Refrigerators. It's affected if any organism. It will grow in a presence and also in the absence of oxygen. What is very typical for this organism is. It's able to grow at very high salt concentrations. It's minimal what your activity is really a low point. AIDS free. The low was compared to other organisms. Bit. It's a very bad competitor. It's wrong. Roll on it a lot of other competitive Flora. Present that cause or use is causing intoxication. Because it's. Able to produce a toxin. In the food. Not all the strains are able to produce stocks in. Fifty to seventy percent of the strains. Can produce the toxin and talks in is he'd stable. Meaning that when you heat a put it. It won't. In activate the talks in the disease caused by a stuffed corpse or isn't it isn't talks occasion. And people have to vomit. When they're suffering from this disease. And after vomiting. People often recover quite quickly. Because the duration is one to two days. And we cause people. Recover quite quickly. There's also a lot of. Under reporting. For this organism. The principal habited of this organism. Are mucous memo. Brains. And also the skins. Of people. And skins of animals. It can be present in our nose and on our hands and also on the skins of chickens and. In couse. But sometimes it can also call an infection. I discard bankrolls or calls for stuff because or yes. And also the status. Is caused by this organism. And I feel skins. And because membranes can also read. Our foods. Often. Initial levels are really low. And there's a limited. Wealth. Because the flows. Always Montreaux. And there's competitive Flora present. But when there is temperature of use and foods are not properly. Properly stored. It can grow to high numbers. An example of a very you would say I'll break. Happens in Japan a couple of years ago. This outbreak. Affected. More than fourteen thousand people. What happened. In this factory. Milk. Bust best arrest. But they suffer from an power shutdown. And because of this power should down a better station process was delayed because of this delay of the preservation process. What a lot of competitive for I was in activate it and stuff works for years was able to grow. In the UK. Afterwards the process and bit of course always continue growing. And producing the docks in and because the toxin is he'd stable it was not in activated. During the continuation of the best initiation process. These figures show you some facts. Of the organism. Related to this outbreak. You can see that people are suffering from the seas. They ingested dozes ranging from Micro. Nandigram. You're right picture. You see the incubation time. Of patience. Which is very typical for intoxication. The first patient to rise after however an hour. But most of people get sick. After four hours. Because we can be positive for stuff because Henri is processes with a lot of manual processed. Processing steps. Can result in contamination of the food. So one way to prevent contamination. Is by varying. Cloths. So often initial levels of cause or is in food. Are really low. And if you'll be temperature of use to grow. To high numbers. Especially foods. Which are protein rates are associated with outbreaks. Also foods which are heat it. Because heating. Inactivate. Competitive Flora. And when then heated foods are equal terminated. Afterwards. By this organism. It allows such groups or years. To grow. Next Leader to foods. Also. Salted foods. Can be positive for it is. Organism. Because it's all politics. All the one grow but cycles or is. They'll grow. To summarize this food borne pathogen. It's especially associated with foods that have a lot of manual processing steps. Also Foods which has a low water activity. A limited competition. Because then of course. Or is. They'll grow. When foods are not properly. Properly stored. These may still fell. Can grow to higher numbers and produce a toxin. And prevention of contamination. Can be. When you use. Good. Unique. Practice.",

                "text": "In this novel clip. I'm going to introduce you to listeria monocytogenes with season food borne pathogens. As you can see at a picture at the left. It has struggled. So it's a motel organism. It also has a what shape. Because it looks like an bacillus. It's invent positive organism. And it's a secretary of. Anaerobic organism. So you can grow in a presence an absence of oxygen. It's widespread in the environment. You can find on many places in saw oil. In a production environment. Actually all places where you find a bit of water. And a bit of food debris. And that's actually what you find on. Surfaces. In production environments. In drains. And also in called Failure belts. Which are not properly cleaned. This theory actually is really remarkable so tolerant. It minimum. What directivity. It's point nine to it one of the things you have to recall for hysteria. And it is able to grow in a fridge. It's minimum temperature for growth. Is zero degree Celsius. The key is to Styria. Includes six pieces. With only one species. Is but a jennet for us as human. And this species. Is listeria I'm going to study this disease caused by listeria It's called Mystery owes us. Fortunately the incidence. Is low because notification rate is low for this disease. But actually the more to deteriorate. Is high. So when people get a disease. The chance that they will die. Is really high around twenty percent of the patients. Which are suffering from history owes us. Will actually die. This figure shows you. It's a set of people. For listeriosis. Because especially Opie. The young. The. All the pregnant. And immunocompromised. Are susceptible. For this bet again and it's what you can also see in this figure. At a Y. axis you see that cases confirmed cases per one hundred thousands of persons. And the Y. axis. You see the years of the patients. And you see it especially young people and also go all out to get a disease. But also the female. It's around thirty years old. Because these are the people who are pregnant. But also some male people. And probably these men. They haven't. They are immunocompromised. When in general population so others going to yo be suffering from the disease. They often have milk like symptoms. Like the flu. And incubating time rainfall for hours to two days. But when a young to get a disease. They suffering from much more severe symptoms. When pregnant women are getting the Z's. It can result in a stillbirth. Of their baby. And when all the people get a disease. They can suffering some said. From septicemia. And meningitis. And in the incubation time for these severe symptoms. It's really Ferial it rains from three hours. To free month. So imagine you have to remember what you have even yesterday. Or what you have two days before. Or free days before. It's really difficult. So you can imagine it is really difficult to trace back. What kind of foods. The patients have been eating. Which have caused the disease and. Often it's rather impossible. He's seen couple of. Which are associated with listeria. In the presence of Listeria daily maid softies roll milk. At a smoked fish. And ready to eat food. Why do these foods have in common that sweet at that. That the do you store them for a rather long time. And also with you store them. Of low temperature. So foods can get contaminated. So I assume that we haven't contaminated ham. And I should use a slicing machine. To get slices of the daily meat. Then the ham is contaminated. Because it's contended it's also contaminated. The slicing machine. And then afterwards. When you use a slicing machine. To cut. And all those sorts of ham. And also dead sources. Still get contaminated. The theory is able to grow in our fridge. And this figure shows you different temperatures. In our fridges. And as you can see the mean temperature. Is around six. So actually at all temperatures we have in our fridge. History is able to grow. It can also grow. In the food. We pack on them but it's fight atmosphere. Because we steer is affected if anaerobic organism. And therefore able to grow in these kind of foods. So we packed the food. I'm going to modify the atmosphere or every package and the fact human. Listeria is able to grow. But how then to prevent. For all of this theory in our foods. One of the possibilities. Is to have food. With a rather low P. eight. Because the B.H. minus of listeria. Is four point three. And in these kind of products like fermented sources. The story isn't able to grow also in low what directivity. Will prevent listeria. For example in her. Cheese's hysteria is not able to grow. But often. We don't want to have problems with a rather low. Phs or rather low. What directivity. Then we can also use heed to inactivate listeria because normal best recession temperatures. Result in an activation of Listeria monocytogenes this. So you know now that this theory is widespread in an environment. You find in of in a pollution environment. But he might also be able to find it in our own houses. And our laboratory investigated by the listeria it. Is present in our domestic environment. And what did you see. Indeed the cereal was present in our own houses. If you followed positive. On this cloth or on our washing up brushes. In our refrigerators. But also in our toothbrushes. And then. My question for you is. Is this in risk. So we do find this to be most to use in our own houses. And is this a risk for you as a consumer. Or if depends on the number of cells you investigate. And also if you are susceptible. Or not. So when the Yo pee. When your O.B. should especially be a rare of course going to mean a thing of listeria in their own houses. Because if you. For example clean. Your fridge. Within this north and then after the contaminated food they need. If you store for a very long time. It can result in two folds of Listeria two rather high numbers. So especially O.-P.. People should be aware of preventing cross contamination in their. The method environments. So to summarize this theory I'm honest to goodness. It's a widespread. Food borne pathogens and incidents fortunately. Is low. But the mortality is really hard. The Styria. Can grow in our refrigerator S. And therefore it can grow in many foods because you. And especially young people should be aware of. Cross contamination. Of listeria.",

                "text": "This kid will be about it you will systems perspective. On the health behaviors. You may recognize these situations just an example. You hang out with friends in the evening. And on the one hand you think are really should go to bed now. I have a really early lecture. Tomorrow morning. But you're having such a good time. And you think OK I can have one with drink I will go bats. Go to bed. Later on and get up tomorrow. Or. When you think I want to lose weight or. I really should start eating healthier. But other than when you find yourself confronted with a nice piece of cake. Or we denies dessert. You simply can't resist the temptation. That this cake has for you. And these are actually the sort of the two distinct processes that drive our health behaviors on the one hand where being reflective. Deliberately thinking about or. Consequences of our behavior is thinking about pros and cons of our behavior and making a decision what we want to do. But on the other ends are also. Impulsive. Processes playing a role in which particular short and distractions actually make us. Given to temptations and forgetting about these long term goals. And this is what we referred to as a dual systems perspective. There are two routes to. Health behavior on the one hand there's this. Rational route in which we weigh and weigh all kinds of aspects of to behavior we really think about it we put much effort to making. In reaching a decision. And this is actually what most. Cheery so far. Have focused on started to reflect behavior protection motivation teary. A very dominant to race in this field of public health nutrition. Actually sort of humor people are rational human beings that make smart decisions that can really take into it. Account. All kind of information when reaching a decision whether or not to engage in health behavior. But actually it is. These impulsive routes are often overlooked in. In many of the. Do you resolve behavior change but. They are important in health behaviors as well. Often these impulse of which are actually seen as something that is very very bad that we act upon our drives on our desires. That we give in to our impulses. While on the other hand just as reflective. Routes in which people are considered. Well. Wise beings. Relying on willpower exercising a lot of discipline in engaging behavior but it's actually the simples of processes that are very dominant in many of our daily health behaviors. The reflective system is actually to system just. The mental Parisian sort of mental faculty that has evolved. To actually share of self-control and. Sort of control. Reflects to the ability that we have to make reasoned judgments. And to make reasons evaluations. But also to. Mental processes that are responsible for that that we are able to plan actions and not be are able to fink. Ahead of time that we are able to fink. Longer in the future rather than just focusing on today and. Whatever is distracting is at this particular moment. And it also includes the ability or difficulty that that. That sort of. Operates when we try to inhibit or overrides. Particular dominant responses that we have. It's a slow process it's a process that. It's new a process that actually requires a lot of correlative resources and. If we want to use the reflective system or if we are reaching a particular decision. From this reflective. Reflective operations. It's actually have strenuous active needs a lot of attention. And that's different from the impulsive system because this is a system that is very fast it's a very smooth and efficient system. It's a system that actually makes. That makes it we simply respond to particular cues in our environment to particular situations. It's very immediate So it's a very. It makes so we have very fast responses to cues in our environment that's also very temporal so. Impulses are only. Short term. Often when you find the temptation if you do X. immediately upon it. So it's suggestive that actually is impulse of system has a sort of a. He don't make em behavioral. Reaction tendencies. Attached to it so it makes us that we have feel a certain. Urge to act that is very hard to suppress. But it's also the system that often makes his experience a particular conflict so. In the example when you have a long term goal for example to watch your weight or to lose some weight. Where you find yourself confronted with nice. Nice piece of cake or if candy or other kind of temptations. It's just just and that makes us feel a particular experience a particular conflict. But so is it a system that is so fast and so dominant that it's often hard to to override the. More reflective of the Russian oil system. And often. To describe this process is the. There's a metaphor used of the horse and the rider and. You can see for example the Consider the rider of the horse to sort of the reflective. System. And the horse being the impulse of system and it's the reflective system that. Shoot. Well. And sure or. Should make that. The horse. State and. So it's the reflective system that you're saying. Sort of the impulse of system. But there are quite some situations in which we actually know that the horse takes over when the impulse of system become much more dominant and it makes it much more harder for the reflective system to actually. Tame down this impulse of system. I will not go into the detail of all these different aspects but for example it might be that's our particular situations in which simply the impulse of system is much more dominant. Could be for example a situation of heart depletion what is called is the situation in which you have already accepted a lot. Of efforts in inhibiting impulses and then simply. India and she will give in to these impulses. The similar process is a clear winner as a hiker going to float away your your memory is already working on different tasks for example when you are already trying to memorize particular numbers or. When you have. When you really have to make sure it's. Attention to other processes then. Then what the impulsive system is. Evoking. Then on the these circumstances where you do not have the capacity to really think about particular issues you give in or go with the impulse of system. This also does. Situation which is more dispositional we know that some people are simply more vulnerable to this impulse or system then others. There are people who are very sensitive to we warts or find food for example very rewarding and for them it's much more. Hard for them is much harder to operate on the on the perfective system. Another aspect that's important is. Habits. When we have formed habits. Much of our behavior becomes. Dominated by the impulsive system and actually. If you're acting on habits or conduct and behaves as strongly. Habits well which is often the case in health behaviors. The reflective system doesn't have much chance. So to summarize what I would like to say we distill systems perspective is that it's important in public health nutrition to acknowledge that we are not only rational human beings that we should not give people simply information about what is healthy or not that that is probably not the most important system in in our behavior but also to this important to acknowledge that our behaviors also results from more impulsive and fast processes and that these processes can stand in the way of healthy behavior.\n",

                "text": "OK. Welcome to this knowledge clip. I will talk about tea in sanctioned Behavior Gap. And first of all I want to like to ask you about your experience of the intension Behavior Gap just a few situations. Have you ever intended to read the literature. Before you go to class but eventually ended up in a class while not having read the literature. Or maybe do you recognize a situation in which you. Try to or planned to go for a joke. After school but eventually didn't go and ended up in the car which made an evening. Or have you ever tried to cut down on your expenses for example in clothing or going out. But did not succeed in the end of the month and. Also known example. Do you ever plan to go to bed sometime. This night. But eventually staying up much later than you eventually. Intended to. Well these are all situations in which you have experienced an intention Behavior Gap and. You're not alone. Actually. Of all good intentions. About half of them is not an exit upon so. Forty seven percent of all positive intentions do not actually result in a behavior that is being. Stipulated in the Indian tension. Before I go to the explaining the intension Behavior Gap I want to take a moment to to explain what intentions are behavioral intentions are self instructions. To perform particular behaviors or to obtain shirts and hours comes. So they often take the form of an expression in which you say I intend to go. Do X. I plan to do X. it's likely that I will do X.. And it signals the end of a period in which you are actually. Deliberating or finking. Whether or not you want to perform a particular behavior so it's actually to a point in which you have made a decision whether or not to engage in particular behaviors. Behavioral intentions they actually sort of. Out. Line what you want to do. And how how much effort you want to expend in achieving this particular goal. So it's an intention. What do you want to do. Intentions are considered the most important predictor of behaviors. And this is stipulated in many behaviors of a metal. Many of the different theories of behavior change. For example this theory it's a theory of planned behavior it's a very dominance model in the field. Of explaining behavior and behavior change. You see that's only a few determinants of behavior but that intentions are cause for the most proximate determinant of behaviors that are a lot of influence like attitudes or social influences that. Influence whether or not people will experience a particular intention or form an intention but intentions aren't a single most important predictor of behaviors. You also see it as in this model below it's the projection motivation teary it's also a T.V. that explains right or enough people willing gauge in particular. Health behavioral health protective behaviors. And also in this model. You see that in the ends intention is to. Most proximity to eminence the most proximate facts of determining whether or not. One will engage in action. And it's actually to question whether this is what of this is the case when. Mets analysis have become doctors that actually synthesize all the research that has been conducted on relations between intentions and behaviors. That has been found that there is a correlation it's moderate to strong. But actually there's still a large part of behavior that is not being explained by. The intentions that people have so other factors. Must account for behaviors rather than intentions. Intentions explain on average twenty eight percent of the variance in behavior but this actually means that seventy two percent for the largest proportion of behavior is not being explained by the intentions that we have. And this is old B. also being found in. Refuse show. Investigating or censor sizing experimental studies. Here you see. This is a Mets analysis that has become doctored by Tom weapon Pascoe's Sheeran. And a sense of size all research from. Experimental studies that showed that into that. For example have communications or interventions they are able to change intentions. So with particular communications about. Pros and cons of health behaviors. We are able to motivate individuals to engage in healthy practices which is seen in this medium to large effect size. But actually a large part of these. Increasing intentions is not resulting in actually behavior changes. So there is a. There is a loss of intentions. Not being translated in. Behaviors. Then the question is why is this. Why does this gap exist why is there a particular get what happens when people form good intentions and do nots. X. upon these intentions. And one of the most important factors is a simple lack of opportunity. So for example when you want to eat more fruits. But if you simply do not have any fruits available at home. It's impossible to translate the intention into actual behavior. So an actual act of control might explain why good intentions are not always resulting in behavior or behavior changes. Another reason for the intension Behavior Gap might be the existence of habits. Even though you have good intentions for example to reduce the amount of snacks that you are eating. In the evening. If snecking is in the have bitch will behave Ritu it's very hard to overrule with simply expressing good intentions to to do so a third reason for this gap is. Simply forgetting. We make a lot of intentions every day. Good intentions. But we also forget a lot of these intentions and. Actually when you form a particular intention as requires that your perspective memory knows when to execute particular action so recognizes the opportunity to and act upon the intentions and. It's often a failure of this perspective memory processes that explain why intentions are not being translated into. Behavior. Afford reason then this is particularly common in the examples that. I started this clip with is progress to nation and progress Nations actually a failure to start doing something it's. Reflecting postponing of intention so. For example when you plan to do to read literature or. To study for your exam. Often these intentions are being postponed. The action so means that you think OK I'm going to start cleaning my. My room first or. They're all kind of other distracting toss that you do for us rather than acting on the intentions. And a fifth. Reason for the intention Behavior Gap is. Is that particular self regulatory problem self control problems. Interfere with the translation of intentions into behaviors. So it actually refers to that. To failure to inhibits particular response tendencies so for example if you have to have the strong tendency to to eat whatever food is in front of you. If you have difficulties with inhibiting these impulsive. Reactions towards cues in the environment. This might interfere or might make it harder for intentions to be actually translated into behaviors. So there are a lot of different reasons why intentions are not always translated into behavior and it's important to to include those were to acknowledge those. When developing public health nutrition programs. So in this clip. You have learned that intention to a healthy behavior. Often does not lead to the healthy behavior itself and. This is what we refer to with. As the intention behavior get.\n",

                "text": "What is our key concern. When we think about our diet. This is a very relevant question many start thinking about energy. Adjustment. One of the topics of this clip. When we talk about our diets. And we think about energy adjustment. It's really important think about what is our key interest in addition research. Is our interest in the composition of the diet. In terms of the energy you the nutrients. Vitamins Minerals. Etc. Or is our main insert. Interest in the absolute intake. Of the nutrient. In terms of the average daily amount. Consume. What do you think. What it is a really about whether you give some consideration to this question. It helps to think about what do you have on your plate on a day. An image in your diet. Would look like this on a day. Is a part of it. Filling your plate. With bread and fruit. Meat. And some other foods. But you can visualize this. As a plate. Which is filled with certain foods and. Displayed in the very much filth if you have a low energy needs. Because you are a person who is a low. Physical activity. The small body far size etc You don't need that much. On the other hand when you are a taller or bigger person and you have or you are a smaller person but physically very active. You might need to fill your plate with more. Foods. But still of the same foods. What you say. You have a different diet. Then Or do is STILL have the same diet. At least. I would say you have the same position. Of the diet. These two diets. With a low energy needs and a high and if needs are exactly the same with respect to the. Relative contribution. Of the relative food composition. The percentage of the the weight. That you have on or off of the total for two on a day. That's from bread that's from food that for me. From other sources is all the same and. Even if you would calculate the nutrients contributions from all these foods. For a person this is low and high energy needs. You would find out that the relative contribution the energy percentages. From protein fat and. Even fiber. Gives you some energy. Carbohydrates and alcohol. That they all are the same for these persons is the low. And the light high energy needs and. Also if you would look at Michael knock yourself out immense. And you would calculate the amount. Divided by. Energy. You talk about the nutrient dense it is then you can see that essentially. Also did which intensities are the same for this person is low and high energy needs. So essentially the fission of the nutrient intake by the amount of energy. Is a logical way if you want to compare the. Diets. Of different people. So our primary interest. Them would be to compare. People with different food patterns. So before we had a food item in four components four quarters. But are different for bethink would look like this with different force in it. And our as our key interest is in the pairing. Diets like this with other foods. Choices mate in this diet and that diocese and other similar comparison would be made for a person has a high energy intake and a complex diet or a high energy intake and this. Simpler diet. He would be interested in this comparison. Our main interest is not in the comparing these two. Because that's the fairy. And that is solely due to the intake of energy. So our primary interest in nutrition research. Is in the variation in the dietary composition. And the nuke you invented this. For persons that have the same energy intake and body composition. So if you're in effect a cold direction. And it's not direct the horizontal direction. Which has to do with. As I said. Energy intake but. Therefore often with physical activity as well. Body composition but sometimes also with Metabolic. Efficiencies. So energy adjustment. Is necessary because our scientific interest. Is mainly in the composition of the diet and then we account for energy. We get a picture of the composition of the diet. And not of the Absolute. Amount of magenta intakes.",

So the relevance of detecting My could talk sense is obvious because they extort. Their toxic effects. At low dose for doctor reason we need three percent of the sampling strategies. We need to fish and methods to extract. My could talk sense for Mike recalls your crops. And we need good methods to analyze the presence of micro toxins. That's for the chemical analysis. By doing that we should never forget also to monitor for the occurrence of fungi because those are the most. Early warnings for the presence of like toxins. Analytical methods that are applied in the laboratory are usually. H.P.L.C. techniques. But also wrap it like he lies our immune affinity cartridge use etc. Those are all methods that are based on. Immunology. Are used in the field. These rapid test. Could be used also at the farm. During harvest. During storage etc before you look at the docs if occasion Magen is in principle there are. We have a couple of possibilities. First of all we have physical math. We also have chemical methods. And biological methods. Let's start with the physical methods. First of all he treatment. In potentially could decrease. The degree of contamination by Mike a toxins but it activity already AFIC. Efficiency of that method depends on the percentage of moisture that is present with these methods it's possible to reduce. Fifty to eighty five. Percent of the contamination. But it's an expensive method. And it is certainly not effective for all toxins that have been discussed. You fear and gamma irradiation. Have found to be. Little effect. And then finally. Absorption of the molecules of the toxic molecules by fluids. For instance that contain a clade of bentonite clay or. That contain active carbon. Are feasible. They could remove. Up to eighty percent of the. My could talk since. If you look at the chemical methods first of all we have the acid treatment that has been tested in the past and was found to be little effect. Alkaline hydrolysis. Renders more effect. And also gifts a fresher do so in potential. That method could work. Oxidizing agents like are possible. Not always effective and. Are expensive. And then finally heating in a combination with salts for instance. At elevated temperatures could lead to high decrease of removal of two hundred percent. Finally biological methods are there. People have found that particular microbes like five a bacterium. Are Antioch and degrade after talks in B. one and M. one. And these microorganisms good. Conferred. After talks in B. one for instance two a molecule called. Afro talks we call. That is one thousand times less toxic. So you don't eliminate a problem but you reduce the problem by doing that. But in general you could say. All these methods so the chemical methods the physical methods and the biological methods. Have. A large impact on the quality of the crop. So it's better to prevent and. For Dr reason. There is legislation in many countries worldwide limits for instance for. Afro talks in contamination of food as shown in this. Overview. This is a table from an F.A.A. old documents. Two thousand feet and it shows that. Different countries have different regulations. For the limits of. After talks in. Contamination. There are a few countries that have really as zero. Limits and. The majority are in the order of four. Micrograms per kilogram to twenty micrograms per kilogram. So by putting these limits. You can prevent imports of contaminated. I crew cultural products. And thereby. It's a means to keep your food chain free of. My could talk since. So to summarize. It's a big challenge to keep all those hundreds of talks in producing molds out of our food chain. Many countries will not allow the import of contaminated products. But that also has implications for trait. In general you could say Mica toxins. Once they are there they are difficult to detoxify. Although several methods are there. None of them is hundred percent. Active four hundred percent sure. Gets hundred percent guarantee. To have a clean product after the treatment. And therefore the best strategy is to prevent. Fungal invasion. In the food chain.",

The first factor that influences the production of Mike toxins our so-called agriculture affect us. And we have an environmental conditions during the cultivation of play an important role. But also the conditions that are prevailing during the harvest. And finally the conditions in which the agricultural crops. After harvest are being Stuart. The so-called storage conditions. So let's start with the agricultural factors. The first one is the sensitivity of the plans for infection. By molds. So particular culti farce of plants that are more resistant to molds. Have less chance of being affected. Obviously And of course. The actual. Talks in producing mold has to be there. To be able to infect the plants. So those are what we call the agricultural factors. And fire or mental conditions during cultivation under temperature and relative humidity. And if these factors are for instance the temperature. Are above twenty degrees and the relative humidity is about fourteen decrease the chance of a plant. To be affected by. Michael talks in producing molds. Increases. And other factor is the mechanical damage of the crops. If there is mechanical damage that means there are more and transports for the fungus. To attack the plants and insects birds and rodents could help with increasing the mechanical damage of the crops. The harvest practices such as the maturity of the fruit or the crops. At the moment of harvest are also important the more mature. Them are sensitive. In general. Fruits. Crops and seeds are for attack by him I could talk to producing fungus. Higher temperatures and relative humidity also increase the chance they are just us. With the conditions during growth in the field and no earlier removal of multi parts. By the farmer for instance could also help to spread. My could talks in producing fungi. So this type of behavior which. You could call a harvest practice also influences. The degree of Mike talks in. Contamination of the props. And finally the storage conditions after harvest. Temperature relative humidity are important. So the lower the temperature and the lower the relative humidity the lower the chances of getting a mole the product of during storage. And also here. During storage it's important to be alert to remove early stage. Small the parts of your product. So to summarize the course of my code talks in Kontum anation yet I sociate it with different states use of the agricultural production chain. The factors that stimulate fungal growth can be regarded as main risk factors for Michael talks in contamination. And those factors. Are high temperature combined with high relative humidity. In a combination with damaged crops.",

                "text": "In this presentational Micra toxins I will provide definitions. Show what they are what they do. And I will give some examples. So let's start with the first question Michael talks in is what R.J. Micah docs ins are defined as toxic. Secondary metabolites produced by molds and their action is that they cause illnesses like. And those are called Michael. My could talk she calls us. These can be illnesses in humans. And in animals. The effect of my Could talks in scan. Can be acute. So that is for instance and. Effect that already is observed. Upon a single exposure. But also long term effects can take place. These are effects that only occur. After repeated exposure to them I could talk soon. As mentioned. I could talk sense of facts. Both man and animals. And in general the symptoms are pretty severe. The symptoms of my Could toxins are already known. In early history although of course the causal agents were not defined. In those days. An example is the earth got. Alkaloids you miked oxy causes that is linked to doubts. Molecule. It is called Ergo tism. Are also sometimes names sent Anthony's fire. It has. Green years and can fill Syphax. And in discourse by a fungus called larvae serves purple Rhea the source of this micro toxin ace usually. Infected rice or other cereals. And here in this picture. You can see the black structures. That's part of the fungus producing. Taining the toxic alkaloid. It's called the screen. And that's a structure that the fungus uses to survive. Undecidable conditions like a winter. Or conditions of drought. And that's part. That's the ocean contains the alkaloid. Of it you can see here. He struck your formula. What are example. Of Fame I could talks in this aflatoxin there's a very well known. And after a micro toxin. And you might micro talks he causes that is caused by this molecule is called. Aflatoxin. Cautious. Also this molecule kind of acute. The facts. With outbreaks leading to deaths of poultry and humans for instance. But also long terms and effect have been observed. Which can be associated with cancer of the liver. Sometimes in combination with have a tight his beak. The fungus that is responsible for the production of after talks in is called. As projectiles fluffers. But there are also other species of us be jealous. Implicated in the production of are for toxins. As mentioned it's one of the most important Mica talks in stop you know the source for this. Mica talks in this very I first. It can be found for instance in oil seats in milk and grains in figs and in peanuts. So let's go to the chemistry of the molecule. As already mentioned we have here. The brutal for my aflatoxins that means there are different forms. And here in this panel you see the different types of after talks in that can be found for instance. After talks in be one and B two. Molecules that are very similar. And they are both. Produced by an AS particular species. One by flatness. The other by Asper jealous. Parasitic us. We also know other types of. Metabolites that are related to the awful talk since. These are after toxin. And one. And aflatoxin m2 these are metabolites of the previously mentioned. Aflatoxins. So after talks in am one. Is derives from half a toxin be one hit is found. For the first time in the milk of couse. So that also shows that it's a metabolite. It's a molecule that just derives from the original. Michael talks in order examples of AFA toxins are for instance. First since G one and G two also produced by the species. After ice. ASPER jealous. Parasitic S.. So I mentioned the metabolism of aflatoxins this is an example of how the molecule after talks in B. one can be converted into different metabolites. By Do human body. And subsequently be secreted. For instance. Aflatoxin and one. As mentioned before can be found in milk. But also it can be found in your ring this confrontation takes place in the liver. And in the kidney. Ought to confer Since can take place as well. And for instance. In the urine sometimes. Molecules that are derived from half a toxin. Kemi found that have reacted with beautifying. That's found in the your in or. Molecules that have reacted with D.N.A.. Forming. Toxic intermediates that can also be found. Soaps and subsequently in the hearing. So different types of metabolism. Different types of metabolic pathways relate to different end products. I will give a few more examples of. My could talk sense. Example is the key to talk since I sociate it. With Telegraph. The fungus that is responsible is for sorry him. He valor of his are Him So Loni. And the sources are potato mace and grass. They are a known is another example of him I could talk seen associated with breast and cervical cancer. And this molecule is produced by for SORRY I'M money firm. As you can see here. The sources are mace. Hay and feet. Another example of a toxin. Is a molecule that has acute effects. That mostly. React. On the kidney. So therefore it's also sometimes called a natural toxin. Showing its target of action. The kidney. It has long term effects. Leading to. Kidney cancer. But can also act on the. Use office. The fungi that are implicated with that are asked for gels and Penicillium species. It can be found in mace. In coffee beans cocoa. Soybeans wine beer. Grape juice so. You see many different products potentially can be implicated with this. So to summarize. We have many types of MY could talk since. They are talk since produced by molds. Having acute and chronic effects. And in direct confirmation is possible for instance five. Animal feet. An example is. If a cow. Is feeding on mold its mace. It will potentially produce milk that contains a micro talks. And we have seen that different species of molds can be responsible for the production of my could talk sense. And that they can be found on different food products.",

                "text": "You know in this circlip I'm going to explain you about the steps in. Defense human beings so the second. The steps that you take. To systematically plan. An intervention program and. I want to go back to the. Example of a group of people getting together. Every week. With people who want to lose weight or people who want to maintain their weight. And this is a group of fifteen women approximately. Some of them have already been involved for a very long time and others just have just joined the group and. Have started this whole process of losing weight. Others also have been in the group and. Have not come for some time and then return to the group. Because they want to work on their weights. Again. So this is an example of an intervention program and. Into Fensham Epping or any other systematic. Framework. To plan interventions. Can help you to ask you to ask the right questions. And for this group. I ask myself the questions. There are people who are just have just joined the program. And who would like to start losing weight. But there are also women who have been already been there for twenty five years. So do these women need to difference information or do they are they in a different stage of their change. Process. And what would they need. There are women who have a lower social economic background. Others have a higher socioeconomic background. And when I was in this group. I could have observed that there were differences between these women. What they already knew. But also the information they could take with them. From the group. So did was another question I asked myself. Would you need. Difference. Kinds of programs maybe for the. Different groups or would you put them together and make use of the people who have already been there for a long time or. Of the people who have a higher socioeconomic status and also remember better. The information that is shared. Another question that I ask myself is what exactly is the objective of this program. Because broadly. The objective. Was clear to lose weight. But in more specifically. The objectives of this group were not very clear to me. And all these questions came up. Because of the systematic way of looking at such a program and. Intervention mapping can. Can help with that. So for example if you look at the first step. It's a need to says mint. So you can use it if you want to look at an existing program. But usually. You use it to set up a new. Intervention Program. And then you look at the problem. What exactly is the problem. Try to understand it in depth. So I understand the context. And also. What are already existing resources. In a community for example to address this problem. And very important in his first step is to also involve stakeholders. To target group and others. From the very start. Then the second step is defining. Program objectives I already said that in this. Losing Weight. Program. There was the general objectives were quite clear. But the very specific objectives. To really look only at knowledge. Or do we also like to do something about straining skills. Among the women. That was not very clear to me. And what you do in this step. Is decide together with a darkened room. What are the objectives that we would like to achieve. In this. Program. Then in the third step. You selects methods and applications it's a bit of a difficult word for using theories about changing behavior and about changing. Knowledge about changing. Other determinants of behavior. For example in the losing weight group. In a group. The facilitator provided a lot of information. To the group members. But I wondered. Maybe it's more effective. If there would be more interaction between the members of the group. With the facilitator or when the facilitator would ask more questions. So the group membership. Would be more encouraged to think for themselves and. Come up with ideas themselves. Hoping that they would also remember better afterwards. Another thing that did happen in a group was that each person had to sets personal goals. That he or she would like to achieve. And it had to be also achievable. So that was another. Methods. That's how we call it to there to encourage people to change. Into sets goals. Yeah. Where they would like to go. Then the fourth step is designing the program it's mainly. The design of materials and activities. In this program. Of losing weight to facilitate the used a lot of existing materials from the Dutch. Center for nutrition. But also took. Articles from books or newspapers and journals and shared that with the group. Every week. And discussed what was in there. But otherwise there were not a lot of materials that were defects. Then step five. Planning implementation. And that means that you do the. Program in such a way that people are willing to participate in a program. And it's also the facilitator in this case. Would feel comfortable in guiding this group. And what I like very much about this group was that the costs of are quite low. So also people from lower social economic status. Could easily joined a program. And they were not. A lot of barriers for them to participate. And in addition. Each week there were recipes. Given to each member of the group and. They had recipes with ingredients. That were affordable in the supermarkets. At that particular time. And also to recipes for made such a way that's the women. Would like to recipes and make the food. Because it was what they were already used to do. So that was all contributing to a good implementation of the program. People were really willing to come and. And joined a group. Then the final step is planning evil aeration. And here you make a plan for evil ovation. Measuring the process. So what's happening in these group meetings. But also the effects. What. Results just approach. Program have. On the people's weight. On people's behavior. So these are the. Six steps. And you can make a very nice plan. Going from A to B. and. A framework like Intervention mapping may also make you think that. It's very easy then from A to B. was of course a really pretty healthy. It's much more difficult and you have to discuss with people. Sometimes you make a decision to develop certain materials because in the end it doesn't seem to work out so you have to adjust your plan. And. So it's more like an iterative process. Then. Very straight from A to B.. So keep that. Minds when you would develop such a program. I've explained to you about the six deaths and given you an example so. Illustrate that and. If you can hear.\n",

                "text": "Hello In this clip I'm going to explain to you the basics of planning. Public health interventions and. To introduce that's I just want you to tell a short story. A while ago I think three months ago I got involved in a weekly meeting. Of a club. It's a bit similar to the to Weight Watchers. Which many of you might know. And the idea is that the group of about fifteen people in this case was mainly women. They get together every week and they are guided by a facilitator. A very committed. Friendly woman. And all of these ladies they were there because they wanted to lose weight or they wanted to maintain their weight. And some of them had already been involved for twenty five years. So does this group is already coming together for twenty five years. But there were also some women who just started to come in. So this group. Like Weight Watchers but also the group I got involved in is what we would call a public health intervention. It's and. Activity that is done to support. People to eat healthy to exercise more also mentally of course that they would feel better. So that they would improve their health. And also prevent themselves from getting I.D.'s and a question for me was while sending that group. Was How can we get most out of this group. How can such an intervention program. Be most effective. First. Again back to the definition of what is a public health intervention. Intervening it's about interfering. Coming in between and a public health intervention it's a set of actions. Aiming at one object if. Aiming to change. And contribute to certain outcomes health outcomes in our case. And they are then of course intended to promote health or to prevent diseases. So these are some examples of public health interventions. When it comes to nutrition. For example. Encouraging women. Young mothers. To to give breastfeeding. To their child for the first six months. Helping people to lose weight. Supporting. Elderly people. Because a number of elderly people have. Are underweight or a day. Of malnutrition they do not get the right nutrients. Causing a lot of health problems among elderly people. Addressing. Under-nutrition. Among their young children. And also. For example school programs. To promote fruit and vegetable intake so these are just some examples are many many more for many other target groups as well. So if you have to develop such an intervention. For example. The example that I gave you have to set up a group. For women who are overweight and. You want to support them to lose weight. So which steps do you take how do you start to develop such a program. Well basically there are two. Two options. One option is and it happens a lot. Is says programs are developed using trial and error. So you just start doing. Your program. And on the way you see whether it works or knots and you adjust or. Add new elements to the program. And this happens a lot. Because there's no funding. To to take a long time to do a lot of research in developing such a program. Also because sometimes. The problem is so urgent that people have the idea that they have to do something about it right away. So they don't take a lot of time to first assess the problem in depth. And a second option. Takes more time. Which is a very systematic way of developing a program. Step by step in very detail looking at what is exactly the problem. For example. The overweight among these women. What exactly are the causes of overweight of these women are they a specific. Specific group. And use research also to do that and. In addition also use scientific theories. So where do we already know about changing behavior about changing people's lifestyle. To use that information in developing a program and do that very systematically. And finally also involving target groups. For example. The women in my case. Well there are a number of. Frameworks that you can use to systematically. Plan your program. Because of course. From a perspective of. Trying to be effective. A systematic way of planning. Would be the best way of doing it instead of just doing it by trial and error. And you can think about the behavior change real. It's developed by some people from the U.K.. And. Intervention ripping is another. Framework that's going to be used for systematic planning. And that's also what we will use. Mainly in the discourse. In. Defense ripping does not only focus on nutrition. It's focused on all. Health Promotion. Programs. So it can also be about age of the prevention or all kinds of other health problems that you would like to address. Very important to remember is that these frameworks are not a purpose in itself. But there are a tool. To systematically plan. And to use research and theory. In a systematic way. So never make the framework as the objective of the project itself. It always has to be supportive of the process that you as a planner go through. So in this clip you've learned about systematic planning. Of interventions and also why that is so important. Thank you.\n",

                "text": "You know I'm going to explain you in this clip about its public health instruments or. Public health interventions. Well what is a public health instrument or intervention or one of the definitions. Is so interfere. To come between. It's like a set of actions. With one objective. Aims at change. Or producing. Identify. Identifiable outcomes. And these interventions or. Instruments. Are intended to promote or protect health or prevent. Ill health in communities or populations. And you can look at these interventions. From very simple. To very complex. From practice different to science driven and from. Intrusive to. Not intrusive. And I'm going to explain. These three elements in the next. Slides. So first. From simple to complex a simple intervention is only one. Action. One component or. One activity. Only providing one. Fall or two people to give them information. For example. But most interventions are not that simple and are can be referred to as complex. Meaning that are more components in it's that they're. Comprehensive targeting. Many different starker groups. Not only one group and. You can look at a complex intervention. Looking at these different elements so how many compliments just. The intervention have other interactions for example if you organize a training. It's also links to another activity within a program. The number and difficulty of behaviors. And also to number of people who deliver. The program. You know as I said before a number of groups organizational level search architects for example if you do a program in an organization you may change the policy within the organization that favors. Good health of their employees for example. But it's going to also do intervention also targets. The employees themselves within that organization. The outcomes. So what do you want to achieve with the. Intervention already instruments. And to what extent. Can the program be flexible. Or tailored. So for example if you do a program in a school to what extent can teachers also put their own emphasis on certain elements in the program and of course. It becomes more complex. Also if you want to evaluate later on. If people can do their own. Things within a class. Well the second distinction. We can make is. Interventions or instruments are either practice driven or. Research driven. And practice driven means that you design a program in a real life situation. And then the question is what is it affects if and research. Are signs driven. Intervention or instruments. Is that it is developed within a controlled. Experimental setting. And then. The question is does it also work in practice. So there are two ways of developing such. Interventions and. Also linking them to practice. Well two examples one example of a science research driven intervention. It's currently worked on by one of my colleagues here today I was or. She works on the slimmer intervention it's a lifestyle intervention for people with pre-diabetes said site sue in the Netherlands. And this program was the. Well it's in a science scientific environment. So very controls and. There it proved to be effective in reducing blood glucose and diabetes incidence. So when this effects was shown. It was decided to also translates this. Scientific program. To practice and. They are now in the process. At this moment. Then the other way around. A practice driven intervention. Is For example the taste lessons. Program in schools. My colleague Mary Kay. But yes Rick's on that. And that's a program which was developed in schools to promote tasting. Of fruits and vegetables. By young children. In primary schools. And it was developed by intervention developer shim practice and. Afterwards. The scientific Bartsch. Was. Looked at so. Objectives. Were stated it's a link to what is already there in the literature literature. So it's the other way around. Starting from practice and then looking for the evidence. And theories. To underpin the intervention in practice. And then the third or the stink sion. When it comes to. Interventions or instruments. Is the intrusiveness of the instruments and who'd made a distinction between for. Difference. Levels. So to say. And he distinguishes. No identity. Organization. Treasure and. Authority. And that goes from least intrusive. To most intrusive into people's lives so to what extent the people still have their own decision. Or to work to what extent does the government or an organization. Make a decision for the people. Well one. When you look. No delicacy. Least intrusive. It's about providing information. And people can make the decision themselves. What they will do with it. For example. A youth nurse in the school. Discusses the consequences of alcohol consumption. It's an early age. With children in the school. And the children and their parents. Can decide for themselves what to do with this information. Then on organization. Level. We can distinguish. Guiding choice. Through changing defaults policy. For example. Urban planners create a network of psychopaths and. That's guides the choice of people to cycle on the cycle path. And not the main road. Secondly enabling choice. So means that you make the healthy choice the easy choice. For example providing sports facilities at work. And people have little. Barriers to go. Sporting. At work. Then the next two are guiding to a choice through disincentives. And through incentives. And an example of this it. This incentives can be. That there's an increased tax on cigarettes. And you hope that people then. Are urged to buy less. Cigarettes. But you can also great choice through. Incentives. By giving tax breaks for the purchase of a bicycle. With the aim that people will cycle and. Exercise more which is of course better for their health. Then. The last ones are most intrusive to people's life. Which is restricting choice for people. And even eliminating a choice. So restricting choice an example can be a ban on smoking in public areas for example in schools or in work environments. So people can still smoke. But then they have to go outside for example. And the last one eliminates. Choice is that. For example young people. That it's now in the Netherlands. Legislation that young people below eighteen years. Are not allowed to buy alcohol. So there you eliminates the choice of. Of young people below eighteen to buy alcohol. Which is also good for the health. In the end. So in this clip you have learnt about. Types of health. Public health instruments and interventions. And we have looked at its interventions from simple to complex. From practice to research driven and from. Intrusive to. Not intrusive. Thank you.",

                "text": "In this clip. Overthrow you more about selection bias in a randomized control trial. And I will especially focus on moment of sports. And the big question is is more going to sponsor in a randomized control trial. Is this a threat for internal or maybe. For the external Flutie. Here you see the population for analysis. And there you have to refill it of your study. But the results of your study. Need to be felt for your source population your population of interest. And if you in fact people for your study. But there is no response. Then to source population. It's not the same as your study population. Or the population for analysis. Well let's see what happens. Suppose that people who present themselves for the study. Are not a random sample from the source population. For example they are younger people. Younger people and. Yes Taken one to the be present in around the much vaunted sort trial. So they'd respond to the effort. In for Dacian. And all the people do not. Something like that may happen. Well do we have an internal political solidity problem or not. Well in fact. Your study population is a younger population. Then you intends to be that. Selection bias is not very likely. Because the results of your study. As you find in your book place for analysis. I still felt for his younger population. Because you recognize this population. So if you have. Younger people and some of the people but not that much all the people. Both in the control group. And in intervention group. You have the same age. Because of the random mutation. So the results you find. Are fillets for the younger population so in fact you are saying. OK my source populations are younger people. But you have a problem with generalized ability. Those their results of this trial. Are they also felt for all the people. So. Because it is generalized ability to generalize. The reasons for younger. To all the people. It's about external for liberty. So maybe you have an external Flutie. Well. If you have gone the people and. A few all the people. And your population. And you have enough all the people. Then you can just say OK. I do my end of analysis. For the younger people. And for all the people separately. And then you know. If the results are the same for young and old people. But most of the time. In the trial. You are but a croup is not that big. So it's not possible to do separate analysis. And no you don't know if your results. In the younger population. Are also felons for the all the population. So the may be an extra in a fluid problem. So in a randomized controlled trial. You saw if population. Is most of the time. Strictly defined. You have strict. In an exploration pretty area. And that's very nice. Because then. No response is not such an issue. And then you know that your results are still valid for your population. But. Because you define the source population so strict. You may have an externality. Problem. So similar I asked. If you. Selection. Problems or your non-response. A cure for before around them is a shit. Then there is no threat for internal Flutie. Because people are in the marsh and your controlled group and you are in the fence your group. Are approximately the same. But in a randomized control trial you have a fairy strictly defined. Population. And that's made in. Proof in tone of levity. Maybe but it may be a problem for you. Externality for your generalized ability.",

                "text": "Welcome. You are almost ready to work on the model. And in these evolve yours. You will learn the basics sadistical and Eliseus for observational studies. And in this clip. I work a few a demonstration of the mold you so you know. Know how these modules book like you see one of the modules. The most you'll start with a short introduction so you know what's the topic of the more you. After you read. Short Introduction you continue. And you find an abstract. And abstract of a study and in this abstracts you see the study of the active participants and the methods. And based on this information. It's up to you to decide what's going to of and there were six methods. Is the right one and to do the statistical analysis. It all go to the site. But. Statistical analysis matters is the right wrong. You need to know how the study design is of this model. So there are a few questions about the study design. And you are going to discover the study design of them what you. Let's go to the first question. Well. If you read the information in the abstract. On the previous flight. Or if you don't know it you can read it again here. Then you can read that. This is an observational study. And that's true. We have to right answer. So we continue. And you can go to the next question. The next question is about the outcome of this study. And again. Read the abstracts. And see what's the outcome. And in this case I think it's over weight and a base to. Let's see if we are right. Yes. We are right. And if you continue. You have all kinds of questions. And in the end. You know that. This is a cross sectional study. And that you are finished with the part about study design. Let's it to the side. What's that going to the night their rights and that's a goal statistic on a that's a committed. You also need to know more about variable and exposure. Variable. How do they look like what's going to ferry a bulls do we have. So there is a question about the type of. Variable. The outcome variable. And in this case. I think at this. This creates. Variable. But if you are not sure. Read the abstract again. But let's see if I'm right. Yes. Armors right. So we continue. And now all the answers are filthy and already but of course you have to answer all questions yourself. And then you see. If you know how the outcome variable is measured and how the exposure variable is measured. Then you are able to decide. What's the right. Method of data analysis. And of course. There is a lot of information about. All data analysis methods. For example this information about detest or about linear regression. So all information you need to decide. About the methods. Is in the module. So we go back to the over few screen. We have information about the study design. About the choice of analysis. And then. It's time to do the analysis yourself. And then you can go to the data sets. We have a data sets in S.P.S.S. or in R. and in this course we use to our dataset. So that's the second of all but that's explained in the more you. And I you will do the analysis. In the data sets there are some hints the fate of all to help you to do the analysis. And if you have the right answers. You can fill in the answers. And click on submit. So this is the place you will work on the analysis and. Once you are finished. You know. Refills of the study. And you did it yourself so that's nice. You did the analysis. Yourself. So you are going to work on these. What you off. And we have. For of this kind of yours so you will do this kind of analysis for four separate models. With separate study science with different exposures and outcomes. So after that you get a lot of experience with basic and Ellis' of your data. Good luck.",

                "text": " In this clip. I will tell you more about information bias. In or in the My School controlled trial. If a mission bias is a threat for into an affinity. Just as selection bias and confounding. Information bias of cures. If you have an error in your exposure or you're out and if what you observe in a population for analysis. Is not longer fell it's for the source population. Because of this error. But you have information bias. So information bias. Is all biased that we filled from. Arrows in the assessment of the exposure and the outcome. But not all errors. Lead to bias. IMO explain this using a an example. As exposure and we take folic acid bills. And we are looking to the association with cognitive functioning. So this is our association of interest. Now suppose that you have an error in the exposure or in US estimate of the outcome. And the big question is no those at leat. To a bias in a show I will give you a for a few examples. First really look to the error in the expulsion. And error in the exposure in a randomized controlled trial is not very likely. Because an investigator just gift bills. Fold as it builds up a C. both to the subjects. But suppose that. By accident. The placebo and folic acid. Bills. I schlepped. Let's see what happens if the placebo group. Gets by accident. Folic acid. At least some of these people. Then the placebo group. Will look like the photographs of the group and in this scruff. You see the course with their performance for the placebo group. And the folic acid group. A baseline and. After three years. And not a placebo group. That's some protested by accident. So the placebo group. The. Look a little more that's the folic acid group. And also the other way around the folic acid group. Some of the subjects get the placebo so the cognitive performance improvement in cognitive performance. Will be less in the folic acid trip. So in this case. The difference between the folic acid and a placebo group. Becomes less. So you have a bias. Because of the swiping of the pills. Now it's taken on direct sample. Suppose that some subjects. Take double numbers of pills. So let's see what happens. Well if you get double. Placebo bills. Nothing happens. Because at the CBOE. It's a placebo. So. Knotting still. Is nothing. But if you have folic acid bills. Double. Well. Maybe you cough that if before much. Just improve. More so in this case if you have more folic acid. Then it's just meant to be. The difference between a placebo. And a folic acid group. Increases. So again you have a bias. Because of this error. And all of the final example suppose that noncompliance. Is not assist. And people to take less bills than expected. What will happen in that case. Well. If people take less busy both they will not happen. Not much will happen. Because of the CBOE is still a placebo. But if people can take the folic acid bills or take less folic acid bills. The conflict this. Performance in the folic acid group. The creases. And as a result. The difference between the folic acid and the placebo. Is less than you expect. So in summary. An error in the exposure is not very likely. In a venomous scrabbled Council trial. But if there are some errors. Then it may lead to a bias. Now let's look at errors in the assessment of the outcome. In the assessment of course the difference being assumed the outcome is this great. Yes or no. And that we have a learning effect. So a doing a cognitive test as a baseline. Helps you to do the cognitive tests. After a tree or a little better you just learned how they spoke but if tests. Work. So let's see what happens if you have to baseline and here you have. What happens after three years. And suppose you have a learning effect. Just because you did the test your cognitive form and in proofs. That's the case for the placebo. But the same happens. For the photographs it's in both groups. You have an improvement in cognitive function. Just because of learning. And let's take a look at the difference between the photographs of the group and of Lisp placebo. Well. This difference. Is still the same this error or this learning effect does not result in a bias of between full of essence and cost the diff performance because both group. Improve in the same way. So there is an error. But there is no bias. And that we have another example suppose that learning is not OK. So the. Researcher knows that someone has the folic acid pills and just by knowing that he just makes some errors in the assessment of the outcome he thinks the cognitive performance in that group improves. So let's see what happens. Well the cognitive. Performance. In the fall of S. corp seems to improve. Just because the. Researcher is not blind it's Or just because the subject is not blindness and he knows. He gets folic acid. And therefore he does better on the cognitive tests. But that's not the case. In the placebo group. So in this case if the error. Only occurs in the photographic group. We have a bias. So in a randomized control trial. It's very important. That's the blinding. Is the on all of us. The maybe misclassification of the outcome. And then you have a bias. And even of the bias of a from zero is possible. So that you will find a bigger effect. Because of these errors. Well let's look a little closer to blinding. It seems easy to just blind to your subjects. And your research is so that they don't know what kind of treatment. People get. But here we have an example of a study on fish fatty acids. And the subjects. That fits all the tablets. And you see what happens. We ask the subjects. Do you know in what's group you are. Are you in the fist only group. Or are you in a perceivable group and. In this table. You see that a lot of subjects. Are able to guess in that script they are. Just because of the fifty. Taste. Of the fish. Only tablets. So sometimes it's not possible to have a double blind study. And then there is a risk for information. So you can control for information bias in a trial. This will be done in the design phase. By blinding. Or you can moan and sort of compliance during the study. So I hope. You know know that information by irrelevant. Trial is not fairly likely. If we talk about errors in the exposure and. If the trial. Is a good try all you have double blind. You have a double blind trials. That also errors in the outcome. Are not very likely. ",

                "text": "In the series of food fermentation the like to show two examples of soy based fermented food products temp A and soy sauce. To start with Tempe. The ingredients for the production of Tempe a product at for instance is made in Indonesia. Are soybeans and beans. On of beans and cereals. The microorganism in fault in this famine Taishan publishes his rice oppose illegal spores. Note that this is a solid state fermentation. That means affirmative action is not taking place in a liquid and firemen. But on a solid state so those are the beans that pretreated soybeans. This is the production process of. Tempe. So you start with the soy beans and you went up with the fresh them pay. And in between are different steps. So it starts with soaking in water overnight. And the function of dubstep is the removal of. Bitter taste. Then after the Harling the material is cooked for about twenty to thirty minutes and the main purpose of. That step is. Be inactive facia enough trips an inhibitor. That's an anti nutritional factor. So that the improved in a traditional value of the fermented products. After draining. Of the cooking water and evaporation of the free water. The material. Is inoculated. With the geese for dry suppose or legal spores. So that's the point where the fermentation starts. Then the material is packaged. But if the packet seeing is such that you can make sure that there is still some oxygen in flux possible so for Dr Eason perf you are a. It. Back at you saw you first. Then in incubating face. Which takes approximately forty hours or thirty to crease. The my Sealy I'm off the fungus. Of the writer purse will penetrate the matrix of the soybean. And will start. The activities that relate to enzymatic digestion. Of the soybean So that's the famine Taishan process and then it ends in the final product. The fresh stem pay. So here you see an example of a traditional process where beans are soaked. And this is how to start a culture looks like rice because it's a filamentous malt. And them I see you can see down here. And it is has a typical characteristic and it has a kind of root like structure as we call Rice awaits. Those you can see here. While they grow they can also make spores. And the spores are in a pouch. We call a spring human here you can see the release of the spores as well. And this. Fruiting body to spring him. Is carried by a structure we call a spring you're for a variety of preparation of a bath of inoculated. So I binge. And then the core first and steak place. And this is the result of those. Confer sins that are brought about by rise of purpose. If you compared are all beings. With a fresh campaign look at the composition. These are the most important. Transitions that take place first of all if you look at the water soluble nitrogen that's an indication for the protein all asis we see the duck number increases. From zero point five to two. Indicating the activity of protein A.Z.'s that come from the moat. We also see that crudely pits are decreasing. And this is a result of the breakdown of the lip It's like policy is simultaneously leading to an increase in the concentration of three fatty acids. And that's also what you can see here. It goes from zero point five to twenty one. On weight percentage. Could fibers. A slightly higher. And the water soluble dry material. Is also increasing. During the famine Taishan. If you look at the end products you can buy it in different forms in the retail. These are just a few examples of products that are made of them pay this is even attempted at this afterword smoked and. You can see it comes in all different forms and people use that as an ingredient. To make their dishes. There are a few new developments in relation to temp a production. Temp a production is a very traditional process. That is already around for a long time. But in research. One of the options can be that you take the traditional process and you apply it to a new. Raw material. This was done in our laboratory where we use looping seeds and we used to temp a procedure. To see if those seeds could be fermented. And the result you can see here. We needed to select specific for Ryans of the mold for I suppose. To have a good famine Taishan. But in the end we managed to make nice blocks of looping. Tempy that were brought to a chef. In a restaurant. Who created all kinds of nice new dishes. From that product. So the story of. I had a message of this is that having knowledge of traditional famine Taishan process also allows you to create new processes for instance by changing the raw material. Adjusting slightly depressed process conditions. And then you can end up with completely new products. With interesting properties. Now let's move to another soybean. Based products that saw the sauce. The ingredients are in addition to. Soybeans also wheat. In a one to one ratio. And it's a rather complicated production process. That is already reflected in the. Different types of. Microorganisms that are involved. We see here as produce a mold. But also a small fill accused and Hello Philip lactic acid bacteria. Three different groups of microorganisms that are all playing a particular role in the production of a product called soy sauce. So how does it go it's a quite complicated. Manufacturing scheme. But I will take you food escape. Schemes. Step by step. So Joe. Just first have a look at the input and the out food. That's always how you start looking at schemes. The importers here. The soybeans and the wheat. In Green. And the output are the products. So I could take. Sediment and refined soy sauce. The refined soy sauce as your actual and product. And these are by products. What you can also see from this scheme is that it consists of two stages. The first States we call the code you stage. And that's here. At this site of the scheme. And not the other site. We have the moral me stage. So let's start looking at the scheme how does it work. The input material is first pretreated by soaking and roasting. Crushing autoclave. And then it's mixed. And that is the start of the fermentation process because here. Koji molds are adults. These are the moles that for instance continue has been jealous. That start a famine Taishan process the initial phase in the Koji stage as we call it. It's a solid state. Fermentation. And it takes about forty eight to seventy two hours. And the end product. Of the first stage is a part of the recall Koji. Parts of that Koji are then used to inoculate a second batch. But the main part of it is pretreated. Is for the and. Prepared for the Morrone stage this preparation includes the addition of salt and water. So what we are actually doing is we changing the conditions for the microorganisms in the product. By adding excess salt and mixing nuts. And because we know that these high salt concentrations these molds. Will Not Be active anymore. We have a second inoculation. With other microbes. And that's what you see here so here. The material containing Now a lot of water salts is inoculated. With lactic acid bacteria and yeast. I put in Asterix there. Because L.A. B. means that the gusset bacteria but also to indicate that. These are specific. Lactic acid bacteria. They are so called Hello Toller and they are tolerant to salt and they can thrive under conditions with high salt concentrations that same is true for two for the Geest. This is so much fermentation so it's not strictly speaking a solid state famine Taishan email because there's so much water added as well. So if you go to the second stage. Feminization takes place. There's a. Face we call aging. Already indicating that this takes quite some time. And then at the end of that process the material is pressed to separate the. Under solvable parts. The particles. In and so I K. And he ends up with a liquid material we call the ROSS SOLLY sauce. That material is subsequently passed the riced past the recession is and he treatment out again leads to precipitation of soul it's. Those are another. Byproduct. That is here indicated as the. Sediments and. It leads to the refined. So I saw stuff can be used for bottling. And going into retail. So it's a complicated scheme. It has several steps. But you can see these are the organisms involved so the ones that are in the coat you States. Are the molds Aspergillus but also milk or a rise of us can be part of that population. They called you molds. And then in the more only states we at the halo feel eclectic gusset bacteria. For instance with the names like Tetro. General caucus. Hello feline. But also some particular strains of like the cells there Brooky can be found and feel like East. Known as. Zygotes sacrum ISIS root shii. And other. So I go Saccharomyces species. This is a picture of the code you state for you can see the mold it. So I binge. The more only States. So that's a liquid fermentation. And the end product. The soy sauce. There are different types of thoughts you have to the target it's sweet and black sauce. These two and you have to clear salty sauce. They catch up Asian. And that's for instance here an example. So. To end my presentation here is give a shot summary what we have seen. First of all temp a production. Is a solid state fermentation of soybeans where the starter culture is them all try suppose or liquor stores and we can see. We have seen that there can be new developments based on a traditional process. For instance the temp a production last used to see if looping cheese could also be used as a raw material for famine about the soy sauce production has been indicated that this is a complex two stage process where molds. Halo feel icky skin lactic acid bacteria. Are active a different stages of the process.",

                "text": "In a series of food fermentation like to discuss a few a number of soy based fermented food products. One example I will focus on. A little bit more is the product called Q Name. But before we do that. I like to show you that I first of Oriental fermented foods. Here in the stable you can see that there are different types of products coming from different regions. Of Asia for instance India Indonesia and Southeast Asia. Products can name them pain so it's also and they have in common that they all contain. Soybeans. But in addition to dots. In some products. Also other cereals. Or beans can be used for instance for sari sauce also wheat. Is introduced. But they're not a big differences between if these products are the microorganisms that are involved. For instance here in fucking namei you can see. It is best shitless. That is the predominant organism. That is responsible for the fermentation. But a completely different organism microorganism rights because all legal spores. Is in fault in the production of temp a this is a feeder mantis malt are also used in soil source production but in addition to dart also specific types of yeast and bacteria. Are playing a role in that feminization process. So you can see there is a large study first city. Of feminization processes that are linked to the famine Taishan of soybeans. To understand soybean famine Taishan. You need to know a little bit more about their relevant correct touristic So in general you could say soybeans they are interesting. Part of our diet because of the fact that they have. High protein content. And in addition to the high protein content also the amino acid composition of those proteins are favorable for human consumption. But there are also a few disadvantage is linked to the consumption of soy beans. And one of them is that they contain bitter tasting compounds. Obviously that's a matter of taste. But to serve. A large group of consumers. This may be an issue. In addition to that there is also anti night nutritional factors that can be found in. Soybeans. These can be trips in inhibitors. Those are. Compounds that inhibit. Our digestion of food products phytic acid it's a molecule that scavenge minerals. And therefore can lead to a reduced by your availability of minerals. He McLuhan ins and flatulence causing all of those Sagger writes. An example of the last. And to nutritional factor. A poly digestible all the SEC right is the molecule. Stock ios. That's a carbohydrate consisting of four sugar. Units to collect all of us a glucose. More U.T.. And of fructose so. If you please it up if you for instance cleave off. Nick I like those here and you and top with a molecule that is still relatively difficult to digest and that molecules called rough enough. You can see here rough enough. It's just to go with three. Sugar units. And then if you go further if you. Cleave off the second Gallic toss the land up with a molecule called Charles. That is well. That's a molecule that is easy to digest. So let's move now to the first example. A product from India. We call Kony man. As already mentioned ingredients for that product. The main ingredient is soybeans. And if you look at the world it's interesting it was told it comes from unnamed police. Dialects. Pronouncing it like Key number but. Probably my pronunciation is not that well. But that's translates into something like for men to flavor and that exactly points to where this product it's use for it's used to spice up all the food products. So it's if amended. Ingredient. You could say. And the a particular characteristic of this product is fermented product is that. Massillon species. Are the main. Organisms to drive the famine Taishan. So let's have a look at the traditional production process. Lined out here. You start with soy beans. And in different steps you end up with a fresh name. That is used for instance in curries or in spicy sauce. And there are different steps involved here in the pictures here show. A number of examples of those steps. So you start with soaking. Of the beans. And then the next step is the boiling. That's what you can see here. The crushing. Of the boiled beans. And then they are packaged. And that's what you can see here these are packets in leaves and that starts the incubation process. And that's where the famine Taishan takes place. And ing up with a product that can be used in all kinds of dishes. So. If you want to have a look at the microbiology we can understand what's going on there. The characteristics of. This famine station is that it is an alkaline fermentation. Alkaline means that the PH is high so what we see. During the course of this process the PH increases from five to seven. And if we isolate. Microbes from that. Fermented product. And this is an example of a research. That was conducted where one hundred and twenty six strains for isolated. They were correct arised. And it was found at most of them belong to the species. Vessel a subclass and a few other. That's a lie. Of the same genus but different species. So this explains. The alkaline fermentation because these bacillus I are specialized in degrading proteins. They secrete protein nasal protein aces and. Because soil is a protein rich product. These proteins are degraded and ammonia is released. The released ammonia. Is responsible for the increase in the Ph. But what step in this production process is now critical. Because you may have noticed that in this case no starters were at it. But still. Those products always end up with a relative abundance of best to life. So how's that happening. The answer is boiling. Boiling is crucial if you don't boil. You will not end up with a properly fermented name. So why is that the reasons are that by boiling. You enrich for Spore farmers. But still a are the most abundant spa farms. These are usually. Heat resistant so. Only to bacterial spores. So Fife does he treatment. And all the other eye microorganisms other there are in activated. After cooling down the spores will start your mean anything so that's in the incubation face. And up leads to a high relative abundance of the sea life. So this is an example that's by. Closely. Looking at the production scheme you could already predict what the outcome of a certain process is. So to summarize this. About the soybeans these are high protein. Products. And they have a favorable. Amino acid composition. So they are attractive to use in our diet. We also saw that there are many. Oriental processes for soybean fermentation. And that these soybeans can be fermented. With bacteria that's. The X. sample that we just saw with can email but I will also in next presentation show MOLTZ that are used and used P.C.'s in soybean fermentations can name is fermented. With a community of basi ally. The type of feminization we call alkaline fermentation. And for to stop a feminist ations to hae treatment is key.",

                "text": "In the series of food fermentation lectures I'm now going to show to you. The production process of making beer production is an example of product does based on. Cereal fermentation. In the case of the production of Lockerbie of Bali. Is there are material but there are other. Alcoholic famine today she says. Famine patients that are for instance based on rice. Leading to production of Saki or mace. Leading to production of the African. Let me first talk you through a simplified scheme. Of the manufacturing process of beer. So this is the scheme in. As you can see it consists of four blocks. Each block is a main. Face in the production process. So we can. If you look at the production process is always important to know where you have to start in and way you have. And so we start with the barley. And we and. With the product that is. Lack of beer and we go around in this way. The first process. Is a preparation of the barley we call the process malting. And the end product of that first process is. Malts. Which is actually. Activated by our lease. So did. The purpose of this step is to act the fate. The enzymes that are responsible for the release of sugars the amylase us. But also. Enzymes that are involved in protein decoration the protein ace. So then we end up with multi multi is then the input for the next step of the process that's the brewing process. As you can see the brewing process takes place that's relatively high temperatures. Between fifty and seventy degree C.. For a couple of hours and. So the input is the malt. There are the multitude Bali's. But also we add hops and water. And the end product of. The second step the brewing step. Is a product we call. War. A sweet what the actual purpose of this step is that the seller law and the starch that is present in the multitude barley. Is conferred it into fermentable sugar us. By the ends imes of the Bali. So the enzymes that were activated in the first stage they set free. Be for mental sugars but also proteins are broken down. And comforted into amino acids. Now we move on to the next step. Now we have a product at do that contains fermentable sugars. The wart. And others going into the primary famine Taishan That's the third step in the process. This is the primary fermentation So here we have to add the fermenting microbes we have to at the Geest. In a process we call pitching. Followed by an incubation process that takes approximately one week. And in this stage. The alcohol is being formed. So the sugar stuff amendable sugars are converted into ethanol. Then a young be air. That is the end product. Of the primary fermentation. It's gone further it's into a larger to be or the matured. Product. The end product. In a process we call maturation or lager and that's a process that takes place at relatively low temperatures. And it can take months to do that so in this process there is some residual fermentation. But the main purpose is to defend them and of the right flavor and aroma. And in addition. When this is done in bottles. Carbon dioxide. Is formed in the solution. Because it's a close system. So those are the four main steps. In a production process that goes from Bali. To Lockerbie and so just a few pictures of the process so it starts with the barley. That is harvested. Then it's so so water is at it and that leads to the germination of the small seats. And this germination process. Active fetes the amylase in the protease is the enzymes that are important in the second step the mashing before the. Malt is going into the mashing process it is shredded. And this is done to release the enzymes and to increase the surface of the product. This Reddit. Malt is brought into the mashing Fassel So this is an example of a large factory where you can see to use tanks in which this process occurs. And during that process. Hopes are added the hops are actually. The flowers. Of the plant. You humorless Lupul less. And those can be either added a spell it's just dry pellets. Or as. Intact flowers. They play a role in also the taste formation. In beer. And they have kind of bitter taste. Then the free move onto darts. The wart is inoculated with beer yeast and this is an example of the types of yeast that you can buy commercially. So usually they come in packets use of. Free stright. Material. These are two examples of that product which dried material. You can read on the package what they contain maybe is not very clear. But here it says Sacro my sissy a few CA. So that's the brewing yeast. But sometimes it's also available as a suspension. So in a liquid. This is an example of a yeast that is useful pitching and full of warts. That is already in suspension so here you can see the label reads. Hundred billion No. Bill new billion a few cells that are used to directly. In ocular eight five gallons of what. So that tells you a little bit by the dose that you have to use the primary family station. This is an example of a primary famine Taishan that they explained in an old fashioned. Open tank. But they're also. Insulated Deng's. If you look at the really large scale of the dust you'll scale production. Where sequentially primary and secondary fermentation is carried out. And this is for outdoor use so these are not in a factory but actually outside but they are well insulated so that is possible. Then the product is put into barrels or. It is put in in a way of if. In the case of bottled beer it's passed to Rice to you can see an example of that. So to summarize this process beer production. As you have seen is a complex process. It enfolds for main steps. The Multan off the barley. To act to fake the amylase and the protease is the mushing of the molds to liberate if a mental soup is from the starch. Primary fermentation to produce out. An ethanol. And finally the maturation stage. Also called lager. Important. Mainly for the. The fella band of flavor. Well if you look at the start of cultures. Those can be opting for specialized companies producing starter cultures. And then deliver the materials Iris free stright cell cultures are liquid suspensions. Liquids are usually preferred. If you really want to make sure that the start of the fermentation is fast. So that there are no delays in the production process.",

                "text": "In this presentation. Which is part of the series of the food fermentation. Lect Yes. I'm going to show an example of a. Fermented. Product based on meat. And in particular. We're going to look at for sausages. An example of a. Fermented sausage is. Salami. If you look at the effect of. Defend taste on the shelf life. That is very pronounced. So what we see here is three different types of sausage Yes. The norm for man said once. The fermented sausages. And then different two different types the same you trying to dry once and. Especially if you look at the shelf life of these products there is a huge difference. So for instance the non fermented sausages has a shelf life of only a couple of days. Whereas the fermented ones have shelf life start. Range from weeks to months. At ambient temperature even for the dry ones. Examples of these dry sausages are the salami. Self lot-I police or when pepperoni. Let's have a look at the production scheme how do you actually make fermented sausages. This is an outline of the production scheme and you start with the ingredients that is called Meat called LART that is box fed that you can see here on this picture. And you mix that with the starter culture in order ingredients which can be for instance spices or compounds that can also add to the preservation. Then the first process step after mixing all the ingredients is the cuts ring. That will deliver you disobeyed all sausage dough. This also Stoke I meet an ex through that into two beings. And those are incubators under different conditions as can be in a brine. Or in a human room. And in so many instances. That product then is smoked and dried and that ends up with the final product if amended sausage. So this is an example of the starter cultures that are used for. Sauces fermentation. Those are usually delivered by the starter culture produces. And they come. As free stright samples and. What I showed my dis. Example is that there are still a lot of innovation is also in this every night. For instance this is an announcement of a new. Meat culture. That is specifically targeted. Inhibiting pathogenic micro-organisms like listeria. So apparently dis starter culture contains microbes that are specifically active against this undesirable microbe. So in addition to the. That's a standard functionalities it also carries an extra functionality. This is an example of the cutter that is used for the sausage dog making a brine Banff. And then. It's time to have a look at the microbiology of the process. The microbiology of sauces famine Taishan can be defied in two steps of which the first step is the acidification and out. Process the PH drops to tell you. Around five point three to five point five. And that Asif cation States is followed by a maturation states where the Ph. Will drop a little bit further. If we consider the microbiology of sausage fermentations two different types of microbes can mean fault. The first one is the micro caucus species. That's an organism. That is capable of reducing nitrate. If the PH is above five point five and. It also utilizes. A cattle a case. This process of. Nitrate reduction. Leads to nitrite formation. Shown here. And that is important to pre-fund. The spoilage dig a outgrowth of spoilage microorganisms. So data functionality of the microscopic caucus is clearly. Increasing the safety. And then you have the traditional starters the lactic acid bacteria those are important for acid if occasion and for a formation. Examples of species that are used in sausage making are like a non-stock lactobacillus been taught him. And P.D. Akaka species. So let's zoom in a little bit more on the role of micro caucus. Micro caucus. In the end. Has an additional functionality showed the first functionality I already mentioned that was the production of. Nitrite from nitrate so. In this case. You don't need only do micro organisms you also have to add. Nitrate to the product. This process takes place us already mentioned if the PH is above. Around five point six. But there's another reaction that will continue to bring the maturation when the PH drops furder. The nitrate it can also take the form of nitrous as. It is in an equilibrium with Neutrik us it's a need for US acted as it so this is no need to sock cites for this is not a an enzyme catalyzed. Reaction. It's a chemical reaction. And I highlighted the need to us all excite because Need to us off site has an additional functionality in. Meat production and. For that we have to go to understanding what meat actually is and what. The color of meat. How that is mate. So let's go back to the physiology of mammals. So this is a very simplified model of a person that has muscles. Has blocked and has lungs. So in blue we have the lungs. The lungs and they have to take of oxygen. And the oxygen is them bound to. Hemoglobin. Comforting hemoglobin into. Oxy hemoglobin. Which is done. Transported to the muscles. The muscle tissue is depicted here. Spink while arriving at the muscle tissue the the load of hemoglobin will donate its oxygen to my old globe in. And that is then converted into oxy myope lovin. Which subsequently delivers the oxygen. To the respiratory. And Symes that are present in the muscle to the mitochondria. So what we have to realize is that. In the muscle tissue. In my overall binde a molecule that carriage the oxygen can be present a different states use. And this plays a role in the stabilization of the color of the meat. So here you see different types. Here at the bottom. You can see the. Oxy my old globe in. That has an iron. Center. Two plus which binds the oxygen and it has a certain color it has the color pale ret. And as we have already mentioned oxygen can be replaced. In this case by water. So here the molecule delivers the oxygen to the mitochondria and then the color of the myoglobin changes. The my clothing is purple Rhett's. External oxygen so that is oxygen. After. For instance a slaughtering when the meat is exposed to the air. The iron core can be oxidized. So note that here it is f a two plus. In both instances so that's the normal functioning here it is F.A. three plus. That changes also the color of their myoglobin It's called Meth myoglobin and it's actually brown. So does the browning of meat that we observe and we put it on the table. So now the trick with need to stock site where me for men to sausage. With micro caucus. I already demonstrated that need to oxide can be one of the end products of that reaction. And this is what need to oxide is doing. Here you see to Moloch you and need to oxide binds. Specifically with a very high affinity to the position where normally the oxygen out of water is. Delivering a molecule that we call Need throws all my old globing that is stable rats. And then. If we add salt or if we apply heat. To doubts. Come to that. Product that contains the need to raise oxide bound to the IRA and cluster. Then a globe in will be released. And we obtain a molecule. That has a stable pink red color. Need to steal him a gram. And that's the color that is. For instance typically found in. Products like fermented sausages like salami. And this is a stable color if you expose this alarming to air it will not change. Into Brown. So to summarize the. Ferment it's also just. They have. In general a very long shelf life. The Femen Taishan process is driven by lactic acid bacteria primarily. But sometimes. Other microorganisms are used that can be for instance micro caucus. It is used as an adjunct. So you add it. In addition to the lactic acid bacteria. And nitrate. In that instance is a sense your father functionality of that organism. Because the reason for that is that nitrate metabolism. Of Michael corpus leads to the formation of need to. Oxide. Which stabilizes the red meat called.",

                "text": "In a series of food fermentation. I'm going to present to you a number of examples of how these. Fermented products are made. One example is the production of. Sauerkraut sauerkraut is a fermented fatty to all it's fermented cabbage and the process to get there is a process that is can be clipped up in different steps. So this is the general outline of the production scheme of sauerkraut. So you start with a cabbage. And you end with the packets products or. A product that is sold from barrels. The sauerkraut. And in between those steps. Going from the cabbage to the end product there are different steps. And I will show you how these steps are. Practiced in the industrial setting. So you start with harvesting remove out a leaf shredding. Addition of salt. Packaging in bulk contain a ceiling. And then. The feminization starts. We have two steps it's the main fermentation. That's the only one that is used for products that are sold from barrels. And there is a secondary fermentation in some cases. That is taking place during the packaging. So these are the covered use. In the field. They are harvested. When the time is there. And when they enter the factory. There's a quality control. And sorting. The cavities are then processed and the first step is drilling out of the core of the cabbage. And you can see here on the slide how that is done mechanically. The next step is shredding of the cabbage. Into small pieces. And then the salt is adults. So the question here is. That's a critical step salt. Why do we actually had salt because that is a prelude to defamatory. The reason that we outsold this. Multifold. The first reason is that it has a selective effect on the microbiota. That are on the cabbage. The second reason is that salt. Inhibits. Back to a little guns I'm such and by doing that they can inhibit the soft inning. The third reason is. That's also important for the family station step that is going to come. Is the extraction of juices. That are in the cupboards. The juices that contain sugars. Order nutrients like amino acids and. Natural inhibitors. Of. Undecidable microchips. The gram negative microbes. So death is the multifold action of salt. After. Addition of salts. The spread its cavities are distributed evenly in a container. Sometimes called the bunker. So we are really talking about huge amounts of product. Those are then sealed off by a kind of water question. So it's completely sealed off. Of oxygen. And then. The primary fermentation starts. And this slide shows the actual micro biological processes that take place in this. Famine Taishan bunkers. States won the first stages or hatch of famine to TIFF family. Station. So if you. Thought. The cabbage contains microbe those are the natural contaminants. And there are quite some. Gram negative bacteria. On the product that you don't want in the end product. There's a low. Acidity in the beginning and. A few metabolize that are being farmed in the initial phase our farm across it in acetic acid. But already quite soon. Lactic acid bacteria are going to take over and these are the hand. Hetero ferment deflective acid bacteria. Like look a non stalk. Mason throw Yes. And look I'm not stuck next to their sonic him. The result of that process is that. He said if he goes off. So ph goes down. More lactic acid is produced but also. Order organic us it's like acetic acid. That's a no carbon dioxide. But also mannitol and excellence. These are all products of the. Metabolism of the like a Gnostics they had to offer Manthey of microorganisms. And note that this is an interesting observation because and. Compounds that you see here organic assets. And also ethanol. Can react to form. Asked us and hazards are important for your own affirmation. And we moved two states two states. One B. as it's called here. That's the home of a man stiff. Process. In that case you see that or not her microorganisms. Are going to take over. The home of a man that if once. For instance. Three percent by luck to bacillus Pondar him. This organism can utilize money tall and action. And as a result. The a city. Further increases. So I can be measured by an increase of the concentration of lactic acid. And sometimes in particular processes fund a temperature has been brought to twenty two degrees. A little bit higher temperature. Also other home of fermented deflected gases bacteria. Can pop up like B.D. or caucus species and to caucus in like a bacillus Brevis. And that leads to an even further increase in the concentration of luck to gussets but also to for mation of. Aroma compounds like. Diasur tile. Use like in the previous stage one day. Also in stage one B. We have a kind of succession. We call. So that's is an increased. Relative abundance of different types of microorganisms in time. So now we go back to the process. So while. These organisms have been fermented in the huge bunkers. After the process they are collected and barrels are filled for retail sale or there is a secondary fermentation. And that leads to the depletion of. All the fermentable sugars. That is done and. Smaller containers. And those. Finally those end products are finally brought in pouches full retail and packaged. Refrigerated so proud. The SO PROUD you can buy in the supermarkets the typical quality criteria of these products are lined out. On this slight. In general you could say that the lactic acid concentration should be somewhere between one point eight and two point two percent flat the gussets. There's also a seat or. But I doubt a very low concentration. Ph is around three point four to three point six. There are traces of ethanol. In the product and. Very important. The fighting and she content of the product is very high. I did read the reason why I think she contends a nice. Mantid cabbage is the sauerkraut is very high is that the process. Has been taking place in the absence of oxygen. It's a complicated process as you have seen many steps are involved. The sequence of different types of microbes. Can take place in succession and. Different types of production problems can occur. For instance. One of the production problems can be a discoloration of the product. This can be caused by the fact that there is not enough. Manganese in the. Products. Manganese deficiency leads to slower growth of lactic acid bacteria. And therefore a use can take all for. Sacrum ISIS. Other reasons for this. Being discoloration can be that either the temperature is too high or does too much salt added. Or there is leakage of hair because also. The yeast. Will grow faster in the presence of air. Graze discoloration can be a result of an abnormal dominance. Abundance of. Crime negative effect Syria. If the product is too soft The reason can be that not enough salt is added. If there's not enough salt. Depicting Latika enzymes are not sufficiently inhibited or the pressure is too high. Stace can be a result of sour. Not enough flavor to high temperature. And surface spoilers for a musty smell can also. To resolve of you scroll facilitated by early age. So there are all kinds of production problems that can be avoided. If we have knowledge of these processes. So to summarize. Sauerkraut fermentation is driven by a community of natural contaminating microorganisms. The feminization process is correct thrice by a typical succession of Hatcher and home of fermented of lactic acid bacteria. And many process parameters influence the outcome of the feminization process.",

                "text": "In the series of food fermentation, I would now like to discuss with you two different special types of fermentation, the so-called propionic and acetic acid fermentations, and I will explain why these fermentations are special. The propionic acid fermentations are, for instance, found in the production of particular, special types of cheeses. The organisms that are involved in this process are the propionic acid bacteria. And usually, these organisms don't operate on their own. For instance, in the cheese fermentations, propionic acid bacteria are applied in conjunction with lactic acid bacteria. Let me first show a little bit about the biochemistry of the conversions that this organism can provide. So, let?s start with a name, introduce the organism that has a long name. And it reads like Propionibacterium  reudenreichii subspecies shermanii. And this organism is capable of converting lactic acid, to three end products, propionic acid, acetic acid and carbon dioxide. And it does that in the stoichiometry of 3 to 2 to 1 to 1. The cheeses that these organisms are used in are characterized by the big holes And they are, for instance, the Emmentaler and the Maasdammer type cheeses. As I already explained, propionic bacteria usually don't operate on their own. They operate in a co-culture with lactic acid bacteria. And this is how it works. It is a two-step process, in which the lactic acid bacteria, in this case, I made a drawing of a Lactococcus lactis cell. This organism converts lactose, the main fermentable sugar in milk, to lactic acid. And then in the second step, the Propionibacterium come into play. And they convert the lactic acid into three end products, that are already mentioned. The main end products of the fermentation, propionic acid, carbon dioxide and acetic acid. But, they also add vitamin B12, because they synthesize more vitamin B12 than they use, and secrete that also in the product. So, what you can see by doing that, this conversion adds to a number of different functionalities of the fermented food product. For instance, the propionic acid is important for the flavour.  The carbon dioxide is important for the formation of the big eyes, the holes in the product. Acetic acid plays a role in taste formation and the nutritional status of the product is also improved, because of the vitamin B12 production. So, this organism has multiple purposes and multiple functions. Another special type of fermentation that was introduced, is the acetic acid fermentation. That's a process that, for instance, is used to produce vinegar. So, the organisms that are involved, also in this case, are two different types of organisms. But, the acetic acid is produced by the acetic acid bacteria. And they cooperate with yeast. The acetic acid fermentation, and this is an example of the production of vinegar, is a process, that can be split up into two stages, in which the first stage is the conversion of sugars into ethanol. So, that is what we call an ordinary alcoholic  fermentation, run by yeast. So, the end product of stage 1 is ethanol. You start with a product that contains a lot of fermentable sugars. Stage 2 is the conversion of ethanol into acetic acid and that is where the acetic acid bacteria come in to play. Here, I wrote down two names of genera of acetic acid bacteria, Acetobacter and Gluconobacter. And note, that is very interesting, that this stage 2 is actually exactly the same process as the spoilage process of alcoholic beverages. For instance, wine can be spoiled if some oxygen is getting into the bottle, and that leads to the formation of acetic acid. That is an undesirable trait for wine production. For vinegar, that is the goal. That also explains the name vinegar. The English word comes actually from the French expression \"vin aigre\" in French, meaning sour wine. A little bit more into the details of the second stage of this process. The conversion of ethanol to acetic acid is actually a two stage process, where first an oxidation to acetaldehyde occurs, and then acetaldehyde is oxidized to acetic acid. This entire process is an oxidative respiration process. So, that is also why formally acetic acid fermentation is not a real fermentation. It is only the first part driven by the yeasts, that is the fermentation. Where the second part is actually an oxidative respiration. But, oxygen acts as an external electron acceptor. The process of vinegar production takes place in special tanks, we call acetators. This tank contains wood shavings, impregnated with the acetic acid bacteria. There is an influx of the starting material, that you can see here. The starting material is dripped over the wood shavings. And there is an influx of air, that is here below. So, air goes up, via the exhaust and the starting material is dripping down and is collected here, and that is the end product, acetic acid. So, this mechanism is called a kind of counterflow principle. So, to summarize; Propionic acid bacteria convert lactic acid into propionic acid, acetic acid and carbon dioxide. They are usually applied in co-cultures with lactic acid bacteria. And acetic acid is a two stage process in which the first stage, the ethanol production, is driven by yeast. And the second stage by the acetic acid bacteria.",

                "text": "In the series on food fermentation we're going to have a closer look at lactic acid fermentations that the gusset fermentations are used to produce. For instance fermented fed to the Bulls and ferment dairy products like yogurt and cheese. So let's first have a look at the organisms that are responsible for this process on how the lactic acid bacteria. As you can see in this picture. And we have. We can distinguish two types of lactic acid bacteria. Based on their metabolism. The first type is what we call the homo ferment deflective acid bacteria. And a second type Ali had sort of meant to deflect a gusset material. With the first category. There's something special because it can be. It can show different types of fermentation. It can surely homo lactic fermentation and mixed acid fermentation. This may sound a bit confusing to you so let's go first to the properties of these different types. The different types of luck the gussets. Bacteria relate to different metabolic pathways to half a nice. To green boxes show the different the properties of the different types of our face. Homo fermentation. Is correct right by the key enzyme something called ls. This is the M. The Meyerhoff our freedom we also know from yeast. This pathway produces spiral fate. And per molecule of glucose it delivers to molecules of A.T.P. That is the energy to molecules of lactate. Young products. And it is important in the recycling. Of the reduced coal factor and India. Those are the general properties. Of Homo. Fermentation. If you look at hetero fermentation. There's another key enzyme that can be used to correct rice these organisms that enzyme is called the Phos folkie to lace If possible keep a lace pathway. As this paraphrase called. Has a not only guilt it either produces one or two A.T.P. depending on the presence of oxygen and. It produces a different number of end products not only. Liked it but also at an all. That is in the case when there is no oxygen present or acetate in the presence of oxygen. And in addition. It produces carbon dioxide. And just like normal for Manthey of power for a Also to be had for of imitation. As a step. Where to read ox call factor energy eighty is recycled into energy plus. So what is so special about home for Manthey of lactic acid bacteria. Has a already mentions day can show us. In two forms. And that is they can switch from home or lactic. To mix acid famine Taishan. And this which takes place. Under particular conditions. Those conditions are. When for instance. There is slow growth or. When substrates like the. Fermentable carbohydrates. Are present at a limited amount limited substrate availability and slow growth are conditions that make. Home or home of meant thief like to guess a bacteria switch from home or lactic to mix acid fermentation. And this is how the switch. Looks like this which takes place at the level of. Fire of fate. So first. Gold is converted into part of faith by the common. Like policies and in my role far far away and then either I or it is called for that into lactate or. It goes through a process in which. Acetate form eight and ethanol are formed. That is what we call makes acid from official mix acid fermentation. Usually produces a mixture of. All these three. Organic acids and. At an all the advantage of the organism. To make the switch from Pyra fate. To lactate. As an alternative to acetate is that it. Second step. Delivers a little bit more energy. A little bit more A.T.P. per molecule of glucose that is fermented. So this table. Has a lot of numbers. But the message of this is. It shows the end products. Of a lactic acid bacterium like to caucus like this that is fermenting glucose. As a function of the growth rate. So here you see a number that refers to a high growth rate. And here you see a number that refers to a low growth rate. And all intermediate steps are also taken in this table. And what it shows is that. For instance at a high growth rate almost all the glucose is cool first is to lactate. That's what you can see here from these high numbers. Whereas at low growth rates. Almost everything is gone for three to four mate. Acetate or ethanol. A nice example of fish which from homo lactic. To mix acid fermentation. Back to gusted bacteria when they are applied for instance in dairy industry Darr usually applied. As much. The strain. Makes cultures. And there are different types of these. Multi strain cultures. But we. We can discriminate two main types and those are the meat or Felix starters. And the thermal filling starters that refers to the optimal growth temperature of the lactic acid bacteria that are part of the starter cultures. Term or Felix starter cultures are used to produce a sour milk products and they usually contain. Organisms like streptococcus to mufflers and lactobacillus Del Brookie. If you move to the meat or feel like start a culture it's a bit more complex there are different cattery is that people mate. Based on their properties. And we have so called. Our Omatic. Mr Phillips started called these are normal aromatic means to Philly starter culture referring to their properties. To produce abundant. Aroma compounds. The arrow Matic meter Phillips starter cultures. There are again two different categories. One is the L. type. And the L. type. Is correct ice by the fact that it contains a looker not stuck. So that's what you can see here. But in addition to looking Also there's always a lock to caucus like this subspecies like this and subspecies crim are as present. The D.L. type. Is a bit more complete you could say. Because in addition to the law cannot stick it also contains a lock to caucus like this dire city lattice. So it contains all kinds of forms. And the non-automatic meter Felix start of course is only contain them at the subspecies locked as in CHREMYLUS. The load is stable you can see the types of products that are made with the different types of starter cultures. For instance cheddar cheese usually. You have different fry and some are made with a L. typed and yell type. But also some with the old type. If you look at these complex dairy starters. They're not makes on. Far. There they are makes for a particular reason and that reason is that you have a kind of division of tasks. This table shows that we have different tasks that microbes have to play in such a mixture of microbes. For instance if you look at the organism like the caucus like the subspecies like this that's in homo. Lactic fermenting like us bacteria. And it is in the starter cause you. Mainly because of the speed of lactic acid production. It's very fast in a process. The same is true for like the corpus like the subspecies clamorous But if you go to another type of luck to caucus like this to dye a city like this it is a bit slower unlock the gusset production. But it's part of the starter culture and because of its capability to come for its site rate. Site trade is also an important constituent of milk and confers an offsite trade. As today a Roma. Or fermented products. And then we have the Had throw fermented to flour cannot stalk. This is also a slow fermenter. It does also conferred site rate but it has an order. Property and that is because of the Had to a feminization. It confers. Also the ferment of Commons. Carbohydrates into. Carbon dioxide which is important for the. I formation the holes in cheese. So. Oh. From this slide you can see that all these different for ions have a specific task. So to summarize the properties of lactic acid bacteria in lactic fermentations. Different categories exist. Based on the end products. That is homo. Fermentation. And had to famine Taishan. And some of the home of fermenting lactic acid bacteria. Can switch to mixed acid fermentation which derives. Which delivers more energy. And finally the strain composition is important for dairy starter culture because it determines the functionality of this. Aroma production. Acidification. So I trade production etc.",

                "text": "In the series of food fermentation I'm going to discuss the alcoholic foundations. Alcoholic fermentation is one of the main dives along the others are lactic ropey on Nick alkaline and she Tica acid fermentations. The alcoholic fermentation childes products that we know as beer wine and Brett. Let me first introduced the. Organisms that are involved in this process. Those are the yeast. Usually this is sacrifice a serious. But there are also processes that I do if my order of species of he sed the. Biochemistry of the process. Is as follows. The alcoholic fermentation. Consists of two different steps that we first go to the first step. That is the end the my whole found fray. That is depicted here. And you and then my whole Farfalle which is also known as the. Commonplace caller says. If a mental substrate glucose is going for it it's in to prove it got it you can see it at the still the Almighty of this reaction is one two two one molecule of glucose yields two molecules of proof because it. This reaction is an oxidation and therefore it to Rice energy. The cell derives energy from this confrontation. In the form of A.T.P.. It's also in oxidation. So this reaction also delivers. Reduced co-factors. And this case to reduce conflict any D.H. can see here. So to wrap up the activities of the end the Maya whole found faith. The power for us to A.T.P.. Two molecules within the H. and two. Molecules of. Pyro fate. Also referred to here as proof of gas it. Step two of the process is the actual formation of alcohol. The at an oil production. So that reaction starts with the end product of the undermining of power for a proof of acids. And the end products. Are here depicted in green. Carbon dioxide and two molecules of ethanol. This reaction takes place in a one to one socket on the tree. So for each molecule of proof because it does this confer to it. Into ethanol also one molecule of carbon dioxide is called for at it's this reaction. Is this sequence of reactions consist of first. D.-CA box relation yielding two molecules of a seat al the height. And then we see a reduction in a seat all the height is reduced. Into the alcohol and this is the trick. Of Femen Taishan because with this reaction. We can recycle. The reduced cofactor and I.D.'s to form. Energy plus again. This reduced. This. Cofactor. The oxidized cofactor again. Subsequently be used again. In the upper part of the club call a C.S. in Yemen myrow fanfare. So this cycle has to be complete in order to keep the complete call for action of glucose. To ethanol. Running. So to wrap that up I referred to reduction. As a net yield of two. Molecules of carbon dioxide. That is for instance the air you can find in beer. The gas. Already gas that is found in the Brett pile. Leavening of the dog. The yield is also two molecules of. Oxidized. And in de Blas So that's. The redux cycling. Of this process. And two molecules of the end product that's in all. Which is secreted from the cells. Also Adora. Alcohols are formed during. Alcoholic from Taishan so. These alcohols are what we call the fuse all alcohols are a higher alcohols higher. Refers to the number of carbon atoms that these alcohols. Contain So here you see a list of different types of alcohol. Ranging from the one with only one. Carbon atom. To at an all too high or three to five. And also all the ones that would not have more than two Kathmandu to be referred to as fusel alcohols. Where do they come from these fusel alcohols. Police is one of the answers. A major source of fuel alcohols. Which are also playing a role in fermented food products as a Roma. Compounds. The so-called. Early pathway. This is a sequence of reactions. That lead to the Decora de Sion of amino acids. Into fusel alcohols or dad or if it if. Diffuse all acids. This sequence of reactions consist of a number of steps. It starts with the amino acids. And you can see here. The amino acid is subsequently Trans Am in a tit. That means the amino group is transferred to a receptor. Which can be to also glue to rate. Producing glutamate. And then. The product is an alpha key to assay it. These can be different types of Alpha. Key to acids depending on the type. Of amino acid at these times I mean it it. The next step is a D. cup ox relation to carbon dioxide is released. Producing a fusil. Aldehyde. This intermediate can be comfort of. Either into a fuse or alcohol. Which is a reduction. Obviously or a fusil acids. And those molecules. Diffuse the acids and if used. Juice Lee are secreted into the medium. Whether diffuse or alcohol. The aldehyde is called for to into an acid. Are now called depends on the. Redux potential of the medium the availability of oxygen. If there is no oxygen present. We find the production of alcohol. If there is oxygen present. More of the fuser aldehyde will be comforted. Into the fuse or has it. If you look at the typical composition of alcoholic beverages you also find these few swell calls for instance in lager beer. Although at a low concentration. Obviously diet is because their source is not the for man to pull sugar. But compounds that are present I mean acids. At much lower concentrations. So the typical concentration of these beverages are that they contain. Obviously alcohol. In beer between three and seven and then. Grape wine between ten and fifteen. You see the fusil alcohol's here depicted in the stable as well for the title organic us it's carbohydrates. That are left over. So I'm not always in all fermentation all carbohydrates often meant a total nitrogen. And Chris are all. What is important for yeast is that they are tolerant towards. At an all because there is a lot of at all being produced and. Many products also require. Ripening. So they require still a certain activity of east. To fully mature into a product. So at the North Pole is an important feature of yeast that are used in famine tasting alcoholic salmon Taishan It's So to summarize a part on alcoholic fermentation yeast are known are sufficient producers of ethanol. For that they used the pathway that I explained the and then Meyerhoff our free. And the reduction of proven gusset in the my whole family is the main method balik root and yeast species. In general have a high tolerance. To ethanol. And finally to produce our own compounds the breakdown of amino acids. I mean I see Decker Dacian. Is important because that leads to the production of higher. Alcohols of fusel alcohols. And thus more aroma compounds.",

                "text": "This will be a presentation in the context of food fermentation. And I will introduce to you. The types of fermentations. And the work assets that are associated with different types of food fermentation. First. But we start with the requirements to run a proper fermentation process. First you need to and greedy and it's those are the food raw materials are. As indicated on the slide the food components. Microorganisms. And water water is always essential. To run a proper fermentation process. But in addition to that. You need certain conditions. Those can be difficult conditions. For instance temperature. That can be important Ph. Biological conditions and two or more conditions physical can for instance also be mixing or steering. Of the process. So the operations. Ingredients in operations make the process and. If you look at the family Taishan process and you want to study it. You can see it as an interactive process. The interaction is between the ingredients in the food. Matrix and the microorganisms. And that interaction. Is mutual. Microorganisms effect. The composition of the ingredients. Of the food raw material. And those conditions then. Have an impact on the performance of the microbes and and. The net result of that interaction. Is your process footie end product. Which goes to the consumers. So remember. It's an interactive process. The next light. Gift. The main types of fermentation that we have. First of all you have the alcoholic fermentations. Those include. Auction of beer wine but also breath can be put in that category. Because Brett is also also produced by yeast. Cruising. Alcohol. Obviously there's no alcohol in Brett. It's a fat parades during the baking. Then there is the main category of lactic fermentations. For instance. Think of the. Fermentation of dairy products that you to Bill's. Prop your nick fermentation. Alkaline fermentations those are mainly. Associated with protein rich. Products like fish. And example is the name our Seuss thrumming. Coming from the last one coming from Scandinavian countries and. You see thick. Acid fermentation it's an example of product that is linked to that his vinegar. The next light gifts the main work or so fermentation. You can see them here. From left to right. You start with the lactic acid bacteria main category. Fairly important in many different processes in amid all the yeast. Mainly that is Saccharomyces cerevisiae. But there are also water. He's involved in. Alcoholic fermentations mostly and. Filamentous malts. Those are mainly associated with solid state fermentations. So. Not in a liquid. But on the for instance. A a soybean. Those we regard as the main We're cautious and they will all be part of this course. What are these microbes actually doing on the food product. The first act. Primary activity is that they produce enzymes. And these enzymes are. Instrumental for the different transitions that take place in the food product. One of the activities. From one port in the fifty's protocol says to break. Of proteins. That leads to improved digestibility. Improve flavor and taste. They have like policies. The breakdown of fats. Also doubt is related to the production of flavor. The breakdown of starch. I mean I realize this is important in the end. To produce assets. But also increases the digestibility. And that is also true for the breakdown of pectin. And selloffs. So all the enzymes. Of the microbes that are responsible for these different steps. Also play a role in the functionalities. That are listed here. In addition to enzymes. The microbes also produce different metabolites. This light shows different. Metabolize a company formed. And the functionalities that are associated with them. For instance flavor compounds can be produced this can be. Alcohol's estus and acids. But also. Coloring stops and says like Carette annoyance. Kemi produced by microbes. Changing the appearance of food product. Fighter means beef item and think of he sticks tracked. And also important. Anti microbial compounds. Like acids alcohols. Hydrogen peroxide etc These compounds. Also play an important role in safe. Making the product. More safe. So. And it obviously plays a role also in extending the shelf life. So the formation of metabolites. In addition to enzymes is also an important activity of the microbes. Well let's go back through the feminization process. And I'll split the difference steps up a little bit more. So we can have. Of a close look at the microorganisms that are in four ft. How do we at least micro-organisms there are different possibilities we can either use a so-called process we call not your firm Taishan. Or we can use. Defined added starters. Those are different ways of using microbes in the family station process. If you look at the favorable. Composition of the food. Matrix. Things like the availability of nutrients ph in water activity are important. And then obviously the conditions that we can play with as people that are running. A typical famine Taishan process changing the temperature changing the accessibility of. Air to the process. Or perhaps the reactor dimensions all those parameters. Can play a role in the end product. So if we go through the first step the use of microorganisms. One option is to apply. So-called natural fermentation. In that case. We have our food product. That is depicted here. As a black box containing natural contaminants microorganisms that are there. On the food raw material and. From the different colors you can see that there are different species present. On that food product. If you apply. Selective. Environmental conditions. You start a famine Taishan process. The transition takes on. And that leads usually to and Richmond. Of a particular type of microbes in this case. Indicated by the rat. Balls. Those are the microorganisms that are optimal. Under conditions that Lee apply. If we don't do. Recycling stuff to start a next fermentation process. We call our backslapping and this leads to enrichment. Of the starting. Population of microbes. This is an ancient procedure that does not require the use of. Particular microbes that you have to apply. As an ingredient. So it's a very simple process. You can run it at small scale. With low costs. The disadvantage of this approach is that it's unpredictable. Sometimes the quality of the end product cannot be exactly predicted and sometimes failures occur. So an alternative. So these are the problems that we associate with these natural fermentations. Contaminations with pathogenic micro-organisms could take place. Which is a safety issue. Spoilage causing microorganisms which can give a quality issue. And. For instance if you just look at the feminization process. The rate and the speed of the process can be in predictable. Because the conditions are not constant. So overall conclusion natural fermentations. Are useful but not always the quality in the composition and safety of the final product. Can be guaranteed. An alternative for that is the use of the fine starters. Define starters are microorganisms that you separately. Cultivate and produce. And you add them to your food product. To start a fermentation process. That's what you see with this arrow. Here you have the microbes but before you can do that you first have to eliminate the microbes that were there already in the beginning. So that means you have to introduce a pastor is Asian or a sterilization. Yes to eliminate the microbes that were originally contaminating the product. An example is the production of beer. So if you add then the microbes you can. Defined under defined conditions run your process. And then you create an alternative for that is that. You don't at only one type of micro but you add a particular mixture. Example of that is to production of yogurt or Chiefs. You know benefit of this approach is that it's predictable and. The outcome. Is constant and you can run the process. At high efficiency. But it also requires investment it usually is only feasible if you apply it at a large scale. So the summary of this. Introduction is that. In food fermentations electic gusset bacteria yeast. And molds are regarded as the main work horses. The outcome of a fermentation process is defined by a complex interplay between on the one hand the composition of the raw material. The presence of the microbes. And the process conditions. And finally. If you want to start a fermentation process you can initiate it either by using the natural. Contaminants on our food product or you could use starter cultures.",

                "text": "With this presentation. I like to introduce to you food fermentation. Food fermentation means that we are working with food. Associated microbes that we use to create benefits for food products. I would first like to provide to a few. Definitions and introduced a topic to you. So let's first go to the field of food and placation. Our food fermentation. Field of application is very broad. As you can see. It ranges from the production of chocolates. To. For instance products like. Fermented fettered have also in this case our kraut or dairy products like cheese and yogurt but also breads and alcoholic beverages. And fermented sausages are in the field. Of application. So it's a very broad field that we are talking about. But let me first. Give you a few definitions of this topic. The first one last point by Mr. Louis Pasteur in the end of the nineteenth century. And he defined. Fermentation such. This is how we treat it in French law firm in fact you'll sell officially meaning. Fermentation is life without air. This definition was based on the studies that he performed. Of alcoholic fermentation. Using yeast. The word comes from the Latin. It means to boil or to leaven. That's also what you can see back if you make bread. There also yeast are in for India. Production of the leavening of the Bret. There's also a more. Biochemical and bio energetic definition. And that is spelled out here it's a very long sentence but I will take you through this definition step by step. The first part treats. That it's a process that derives metabolic and you from the oxidation of organic compounds. If we put a period here. That would not be enough. Because that also holds true. For instance for a respiration process. Maybe you can recall that the respiration process requires oxygen. That's an electron acceptor that's comes from outside. Fermentation is different in that respect. Because it Google ISIS and now. The second part of the definition follows. It utilizes and then dodginess. Electoral maps after which usually is an organic compounds. So there are also order definitions possible. If we think of food fermentation which is probably one of the oldest. Food processing to always use on earth. A simple definition would read like this you could call it a bio process. And that is driven by micro organisms. And their enzymes. So that combination. Is important to India and. Yield a food product with desired. Or desirable properties. It's a transition. So if you look at the basics of a food fermentation process. These are the steps. The simple steps that you have to take you start with the food raw material. That's here. The column. At the left which can be for instance. A An animal the Rife product like. We'll. In this case or. Fruits of fetch your troubles or here is an example of soy. And if you. Combine that with microorganisms. You introduce microorganisms then they call first in takes place. Which leads to a fermented. Products. With all kinds of properties desirable properties. Ranging from. Food safety shelf life extension. Nutritional value. Texture aroma. Etc So distance ition. From a food raw material to a product with desirable properties is driven by microbes. They are. What we call. Our microbial work horses for this process. You could ask yourself the question why are we ferment thing food raw materials. And the main reasons are that they prevent spoilage. And increase the microbial safety. This is probably also the main reason why people have started. Fermenting food products. It's a very ancient technology. But also additional benefits were found to be associated with amended foods like. Improved digestibility. The production of taste and aroma compounds. But also improved textual properties you could perhaps think of rope Enos of yogurt. That is a result of the. Microbial production of a molecule that includes detection of properties. And finally. Relatively recent research have also has also indicated that the nutritional value. For instance the calm. The concentration of particular fighter means can be improved by performing a feminization process. And last not. But not least fermented food products they are abundant in our diet in all over the world in all cultures you can find fermented products with that's also a very good reason why we are studying. Food fermentation process. And finally and at. Maybe a more and more important argument. The process as such does not require a lot of fossil fuels. To drive. Most of those processes to take place at ambient temperatures. So the take home message use of this introduction are that food fermentation is one of the oldest processing food processing technologies on earth. The famine Taishan process. Is driven by beneficial microbes so we need to study those microbes in order to understand the process of food fermentation. And finally the famine Taishan process delivers all kinds of. Desirable functionalities to our food product.",

                "text": "Hello. When I've kissed him by him and. I'm going to talk to you about tissue culture. And regeneration. And how these processes. Can be the basis for a plan by technology. So what do you plan to Chicago. It's growing in propagating plants in the soil free medium. From single cells or from tissues. And why is tissue culture important for biotechnology. When in general terms. It can be used to obtain. Many clonal plants which are genetically identical. From one single cell or. Bunch of cells. For G M O's. It's very important because you need to regenerate plants. From a single transformation event. I.E. in general from a single cell. Base. Circumvents the problems you get with kind marry plants. Part of which maybe transform them part of which may not. Regeneration is often the bottleneck for transformation. There are however many tricks which. Couple I'll come to. Later on to help you. Regenerate plants from single cells of on the French of the tissue. So what can we achieve well as I said. We can produce exact copies of plants. With desirable traits. Something which is done. In all kids for example. To produce many. Identical. Plants that can be then directly sold. But we can also produce a great many plants without any seeds just by vegetative reproduction. We can regenerate whole plants from single cells that have been genetically modified not come back to that as well a little bit like. The production of plants. We can do under sterile conditions. So we do not transmit any other diseases past. Pathogens. And so this is a clean way of producing plants. Plants can be the. Used. From seeds. That have very little chance of actually German a thing by themselves we can rescue the embryo it's called embryo rescue. From the young seedling from an immature seedling and. Tissue culture grow that up into a whole plant. But we can also use tissue culture. To actively clean. Plants from. For example viral infections. So that we can multiply them quickly. In a sterile fashion and. Make use of those plants for horticultural agriculture. So tissue culture. Is Growing up plants from. Single cells it's. In vitro. We use an artificial medium. No one saw oil based medium. Either as a liquid. Or as a solid liquid. We have suspension cultures of cells many cells growing up in a shaker of liquid medium. All we can put a single explant on a medium. That is solid for example containing egle aggros. These media. All have something in common they have to have mineral. Complex mineral new trends. Of trace elements and. The micronutrients. We need victim and a mind now acids we need a carbon source such as sucrose. And we need hormones that. Keep the tissue. Dividing. And in the end differentiating into different tissues. Now let's just have a think about. Tissue culture and. What our targets may be. For manipulation. In this case. I'd like to illustrate to you. The difference between. Animal cells and plant cells. Not animal cells. Just really have a cell membrane surrounding them in which. There are all these different types of organelles. Many of which you find in plants. Cells. Such as gold you have praised us. Mitochondria. And various other elements. Rich and diplomatic ridiculous both rough and smooth and of course the nucleus. Now plant cells have one characteristic which separates them off. From all other systems. Biological systems in that they have a cell wall. That makes them by definition. More difficult to get things in and out of so you've got to usually release. Somehow the cell from it's in casement in order to be able to get at it and target. These organelles that you wish to transform. Now basically the D.N.A. in a plant cell is in the new class. As we know. If we want to add a gene. Bit by breeding. Or by G.M.O.. It's usually the nucleus that we talk it. Nuclear genes. However there are two other organelles. The mitochondrion like an animal cells. Contains D.N.A.. And that could be a target for transformation. But above all the unique feature of the plant cell is the. Chloroplast. Which again has its own D.N.A.. Both these organelles abounded by. Double membrane. Laos and make them actually quite bacteria like indeed. These organelles. Originate it is thought from. Bacterial origins. So their D.N.A. as well. Has the bacterial recombination systems allowing you to integrate D.N.A. into them. Relatively easily especially in the chloroplast. They also have Y. Bers arms. Which are more bacteria like than the Y. but arms. Found in the cytoplasm of a plant cell. So these are interesting. Alternative targets that say for transformation. But the whole plant cell. Is bounded by this membrane. And that's what makes many plants. More difficult to regenerate as well because you have to go through this. Single celled. Stage where there is no. Can be no. Cell wall. Around that cell. Now many plants. Can regenerate readily. Here we've got a picture of tobacco. Growing up. From a little stem. Explant. You go through a phase of callous and. After that a shoot. Will spontaneously regenerate from that. Those shoots can be cut off and put on the hormone free me. Medium where they will generally root. If not orcs and can be added to promote root growth. But tobacco. And many stolen nation's plants. Transform very readily. However there are more difficult plants. To regenerate and so I've been is one of these. And I show here a picture of an ember genic callus. That has produced many. Micro embryos which can be induced on a hormonal level. To then regenerate. Into from a callous. To these. Embryo. Clumps these individual embryos will then. Grow up. To produce a new plant. So in conclusion. Quickly I'd like to have these final take home message yes. Tissue culture. Is a tool for by technology regeneration. From single cells. Is still important. Technique and. Specifically for in combination with transformational genetically Martin genetic modification. Tissue culture. Is the route from trends. Towards the transformation of crops that are difficult to transform.",

                "text": "Hello my name is Chris embalm them going to talk to you about planned home runs. I'm going to talk to you about the different types of plant hormones. And their effects but first of all let's just think. Two plants really have hormones. Well. Animal systems. Have hormones that's where the word comes from. And they're defined as chemical signals. Produced by. And a cringe glands. And these hormones are then transported by the circulatory system. And have specific targets in. Cell types. Organs. Throughout the body. Hormones have very many chemical compositions. Of. Peptides the slippages. Minor acids and of course. The well known steroids. Probably the largest group there are the Lipitor the the proteins which is not so well known we always think of steroid hormones as being the major class but. Indeed. It's very diverse in animal systems. So what does that look like implants. Well. Plants do not have a circulatory system. But they do have transport systems in the xylem to take the nutrients in the water. Up from the roots and flow em. To take the assimilates. Sugars and things like that down towards the individual organ. Plants don't have in that sense and the crying glands they don't have specific glands that produce. Mainly chemical compounds or signals. But plants do have many types of chemical signals. Which is synthesised in one particular organ. And usually act to the distance to that organ. It was suggested earlier on that plants. Shouldn't the hormones in animal systems are not quite analogous to plants so they were called. Plant growth regulators. But I think. These messengers nowadays that. We know about. Taking more and more on the characteristics of AM animal hormones so I think that we should stick to the word plant hormone. Now. Hormones in plants. Have many different chemical compositions. Here are a few. Chemical formulae. Of the major classes of plant hormones such as options. Cytokines Gibril a cascade of cystic acid and ethylene. And you can see that there are nearly all. Poly cyclic. Our Matic compounds. Apart from ethylene which actually is a gas and. That acts as a gas and. Is trans. Ported by the air. To the site of action. Now there are many additional classes of hormones and nearly every year a new home on. Is found in this scribed in the literature. Some of the more more recent tall mans a sprig sample breasts no steroids. Akin to the steroids in animal systems. Salicylates vitamin aspirin. In principle. Which is a signaling compound found in plants that. Signals. Especially in response to stress. Jasmine eggs another volatile compound. That signals. In response to herbivore. Either insect or large herbivores. Action in the plant. Striker lacked talents. Struggle lack turns or a new class very new class of hormones that have been found to be working in conjunction with. Auctions. To release. Dormancy and promote growth. And there are many other peptide hormones. So small proteins which transported throughout the plant. Such as. The Florey Gen The hormone that's produced in the leaves and. Is transported to the apex of the plant where it regulates the transition from vegetative degenerative growth and flowering. Now the classic. System. Of. Hormones is probably Orks in and. Cytokine and. These two hormones act. Antagonistically in a sense. The ork sense are produced in the apex. And transported downwards and the cytokines are produced in the roots and transported upwards. And Orks inside the canons of probably the world's. Well known. System. Of hormones and. Depending on the gradient where in this gradient between oxen coming down side to kind in coming up. Seems to define what type of cells grow what type of organs grow. In that gradient. So the gradient is there. Above all important. That gradient is established very early on during development Here's a diagram of. A Basically a tetrad at an early stage. Plant which has been produced from the fusion of a. Pollen egg. Sperm cell and. An egg cell from the mother. I'm already early on in the red cells. Orks in is being produced. And that is determining the polarity within the embryo. That then develops into the shoot and of the bottom of the lower part into the root. So hormones. Establish that very early patterning and cell fate of in the whole plant. In general terms. If you look at them individually. Cytokine and promote shoot growth where all sins. Promote root growth. But it's important to see that. It's about the site. Of synthesis and the quantity of synthesis. That has to be remembered that. These all these plant hormones. Act in very very very tiny amounts. The transport is of course very important in this is often polar so it starts at one place and his trance. Ported through the system. Cell by cell. At the end of that there is usually a receptor a protein. In the cell membrane. Of. The target cell which. Senses. The arrival of the protein. And then. Produces a cascade often of transcription activity. That produces lots of new. Gene expression. All signals. Must be perceived. And the signal must be transfused leading to an effect. Such as I said. Gene induction. Now going back to. Major classes of plant hormones. Each plant home on has sort of a characteristic set of properties. GA for example G. of regular gas is produced longer cured no. Growth. So extension of a stem or. Or indeed a root or stolen is produced by GA. The by synthesis of GA is enormously complicated. We have more than forty different types of GA bots in the end. There's only two known. Gas'. GA One and GA four. Which seem to be biologically active. The network of these other precursors. Is unknown whether they may be. Storage forms or. Degradation forms. And it's not quite clear why there is this complexity in the by synthesis although they are complicated compounds. J. also promotes flowering. As an example. The abscissa gas it is a hormone which is actually derived from Karata noids. And it causes. The production of the. Abscission zone. The core Claire. At the point of. The stalk of a. Leaf where it will drop off or indeed with fruit. Where the abscission zone. Will cause that. Apple to drop from the tree. A.B.A. also regulates the model. Closure. A.B.A. is a hormone. That is effected by stress and. Will modulator stress responses implants. A.B.A.. Also regulates things like seed dormancy. Or Bud dormancy is not quite clear how that's. Regulated whether it is by A.B.I. or not and next class of hormone that I went into is a gas. Ethylene a very simple compound. It's transmitted through the air. It's involved classically in fruit ripening That's why if you put a banana. In a bag with an ripe tomatoes. These will ripen more quickly. And that's because the large amounts of ethylene a produced by bananas. Which will help the. Tomato to ripen. Ethylene is also stress related hormone it is. Secreted when there is. When the plant is under stress. And it will inhibit growth and induce in essence. However as always in biology. Things are rather complicated. Despite the fact that I've described to you. The individual actions of these hormones. Hormones never act on their own. In a living system. They always act. In complex networks. And here you can see a diagram of the effects. Both on and on itself. And on the other hormones. Of the different major plant hormones. Small increases in the hormones. Can have huge effects on gene expression. And many hundreds of genes. Will be induced by only moderate levels of increase of any particular hormone. Or the reduction in ANY the presence of any hormone. So I'd like to leave you with some conclusions. Plants do have hormone. Hormones regulate. Growth and Development. Plant hormones. Work individually. Yes. But they actually in vivo. All work together and hormones. A synthesised. Transported. And perceived.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip is to introduce you to relevant aspects of hands with regards to microorganisms. And the effect of hand washing and organisms. For hand washing you should realize that there's two types of flora. On hands. There is the transient Flora. Which is temporary on hands which you pick up. When you handle things. If you are ill. Ill person might half. Pathogens. On his or her hands. And if this person has handled. Raw food or has handled fecal material. Transient Flora. It's on the hands. It comes out with contact with dirty things but it can also be washed off. On the other hand. So to speak. There is that residents Flora. The resident Flora. Is always on your hands it belongs to you. It's part of your skin and that party also live in your skin. And there's one particular organism that is important here because there's one pathogen. That lives on the human skin. And that this stuff or the carcass R.E.O.'s a certain percentage of people around thirty percent. Mostly. Is healthy Kariya. Of star on his or her skin. And that is not necessarily wrong or. A problem and belongs to the scale. Skin. All me if this person handles food. Which is subsequently he mistreats. This person can contaminate food. And cause problems due to stuff are yes. If you start hand washing the effect on residents for a trance and Flora. Is different. If we look here at a number of friends us that a person does and hand-washing. And here on the walk. Number of organisms. On the hands. Then we see that you are residing or. Resident Flora. Rarely goes down. This rock. Belongs sure you have. Yes. And it stays there there's an enormous number. On the hands. Transient Flora. That just came on the hands. Can be washed off to a certain extent. But several. Lock units. There's an enormous difference between China and four and RESIDENT three but usually. The part that you are trying for. So they can be washed off so that's the positive side. When we look at transient Flora an example of this tranche of four is norovirus and that's has been studied in detail. By Mrs to that doctor. And. She made a model that this person who is a carrier. Of the virus. May spread it into the environment. From the environment. To the hands. And back and forth. To aerosols to food and water. And by hand hygiene. She. Modeled that. Several transmission. Can be stopped. So do other. Infected person does not reach the uninfected question. So hand washing. May stop just perhaps off. For example norovirus but also author. Transient Flora. How does hand washing that needs to be done. W.H.O. had some very nice carbines what your hands with water. Apply enough soap. To cover all handsome face. Wrap your hands. Right. Over left or some etcetera. Palm to palm. Backs of the finger so that's quite a quite a serious. Rotational robbing. You've got a way around that. Rinsing the hands off with sufficient amount of water. Dry for really. With a single use towel. If you use a towel that has been used by twenty five other people's You might well. Contaminate yourself rather than. Dry. You. Different towel to turn off the faucet. That's a good advice or wise advice. And then your hands are safe. Safe. At least. They are cleaned. Now washed. This sequence. Off. Eleven steps. Takes quite a while and. It has been advised to wash your hands for at least thirty seconds. I try. I was washing there and I was thinking. I'm washing my hands really. Very long my husband was counting. And he sat. It was twenty seconds. And I thought it was really long. So this sequence of handwashing advice by W.H.O. is a very long washing very thorough washing. About perhaps. And then the question is how do people comply with this. Twenty thirty twenty to thirty second is very long and then the handwriting. If these papal towers are not available. Usually people act. And then go on. That's why in some food factories automated. Hand washing has been dried so you enter your hands. Into the automated hand wash and then automatically all the stops. I show in the picture. Are Gone. Including drying. You don't have to turn up the faucets. So your hands. Stay clean. Because this is very important. Because when you. Then after hand washing. Touch something that's been contaminated specifically with pathogens. All of the hand washing. Is Gone fact. And also after hand washing you may apply disaffection which further reduces to transient Flora. That has come on your hands. There's also some soap. This is also so. With some this effect in there. It helps a bit. To reduce the number. Specifically of trying to and Flora. That you're half on your hands. Helps a bit but not one hundred percent. Then there's an ongoing discussion as well out about her gloved hands are better than bare hands. But Glass hands need to we wished us well. Because people tend to sweat. In the glass. FS You Taff nightly. Need to wash your hands goods. With bare hands with blasts hands. And there's also a theory that SAS people without glasses work more precise and tend to wash their hands. More often than people with gloves. I don't know if. I think it will depend on the situation. What I do know is that in a real high care see a situation where all. Confirmation of food needs to be prevented. These blasts are seen in the picture are not sufficient that you need glass. Up to all the slaves to prevent things from falling out of the sleeves and long laughs. Are requirements. So to summarize. Hand washing is part of hygiene. Both in private life in food factories everywhere. Mistakes are very very common. For example. Touching. With your hands what you're clean hands. The faucet or other things. There is a difference between trenchant. And resident fora and. Laughs can be used. But there is not an agreement whether they help. In every case.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip. Deals with the basic principles of that affection. Which is also. Sometimes referred to as sanitation. A good. This infection. Should traduced a number of organisms. On the surface. With a factor. Ninety nine dollars ninety nine percent which is equal to a five. Lock reduction. Which is a more common phrase in my community. But before doesn't faction. This surface. Needs to be clean. Because if it's not clean. That is a fact and to Con do its work. Cleaning. And there's infection. Are different things. Good cleaning. There is not directly affect the number of microorganisms or at least not to a large extent a good cleaning. Causes fifty to ninety percent reduction of microorganisms. But it has removed the dirt and nutrients. For the organisms to later. Grow again. So it's prevents growth. And it enables. This infection. Which than can cost a far Flocke reduction. So. The aim of this infection. Is to obtain. Reduction. That is feasible for the process. It does not a match to reality. But it should reduce the number of organisms. Sufficiently to. Later. Produce safely. This is a standard. Disaffection test without. Cell Therapy. But let us look at the matter of disaffection. A matter. That is quite often used. That's not used disinfectant at all but uses heat. That's the most commonly used mate. Way of that's infection. Hot water. The principle is to naturalization of proteins in there. In the organisms. They die because of heat. That can be dry heaves by twenty eight. With water present is much more effective to kill. Organisms. So hot water is the most effective way. Off. He to disaffection. Besides he eats there's affection. You can also be used for a dozen affection but only for free clear liquids. Like Water. If it's target the U.V. cannot penetrate into the liquids and it doesn't work. When your feet and heat cannot be used as effect and so are you. And there's a whole range of chemical. Disinfectants that can be use the cold. Sometimes sanitizer sometimes. That's infected it's. Let us look at the various groups. The first group that is quite often used as the oxidized and as Dan named SAS. The principle is that they oxidize. Elements of the microbial cell. They just are protein center so they disturb the enzyme so to sell Congo Any me anymore. And die. They all have some disadvantages. The how insurance among the oxidized us for example chloride and bleach and you know dying. They're very very sensitive to soil. So if there is a sort of presence. And you start cleaning or disinfectant with bleach the bleach. Reacts with the soil. And the effect. Goes wasted. So if you want to use bleach. If. Firstly. And then apply an oxidizer. Likely each. Because the halogens. Among the oxidizes are for a very sensitive to soil. Hydrogen peroxide. Can also be used. But only with the organizer. The organisms that. Do not contain catalyze if that's a lace is present. It will degrade the hydrogen peroxide and. The organisms. One guy. At least not to the extent that you wish you to do. Paracetamol asset is a very very strong. Oxidizer for a efficient can also check for one of the few sanitizers that it activates spores but it is. Corrosive so. If you disinfect with peroxide. Every day. Your equipment wears away. Ozone can also be used. But it's very unstable it's also corrosive. So the oxidizer can be used widely used but they also. All have to a desert that yes. There's also other groups have that affect them. For example. Yes And I think. You'll know damp from the lap. The principle of their effect is that they cost membrane leakage due to sound and the effect off at an all. On the cells is optimal around sixty or seventy percent. That's why you see in the lap for this infection. Always at an all. At seventy percent. Not sixty nine. And that is because higher concentrations off. At an all. Are back to your static. So if you would choose. Ninety six percent. At an all. Percent. I should say that and it's back to your static and not. Back Terrio sidle. Back to Aereo side all. You want a desert effect and. To be back to your side also I will meet Skilling and. Ninety six percent at an all. In activates to sell. The microbial cells but only on a temporary basis. It's draw us. The water from the microbial cells. So quickly that the cells. In fact are preserved. And when what later. Comes my. The cells revive again. So ninety six percent ethanol is only bacterial So I think. It doesn't in. Activate the selves. So in the lap. We always use a lower percentage because it's more efficient. Not because it's cheaper. It's more efficient. Alcohol's. Are free goods. This affect us but they're also very expensive. L. the heart. Is a not a group. Form a line. Is an example of dose the. In simple as that it just stops the cell or the wall starts to leak. The disadvantage is that they are for each Oxic. And they're not for a stable. Never felt smell. So do not use that much. Feed also and their derivatives Lysol car accident are very good disinfectants they use mainly in hospitals. But they have a smell. And they're highly toxic. So they're not for you free. Often used in food industry. What are used very often. Art of quaternary. Ammonium compliant. Compounds. Or kwacha. Their use of RAI March. They changed the program of. Permeable to have to sell membrane. And themselves why the disadvantages. Is that gram negative bacteria. Tend to develop resistance against the squats. And that's why this infection. With quotes is often alternated with this infection with a lot of tripe. Off. This effect and. To kill those negatives that have to be found of resistance. And full lives are sometimes used as well there so I have a soapy character. And they disturb the protein synthesis. Let's look at the effect of a number of that effect and so on the organisms. This is a test that we perform in a lab with a number of disinfectants here they are. I set up an all in two concentrations. Oxidizer. Bleach. Another oxidizer peroxide an oxidizer. And quad. And this is the lock reduction. That this doesn't affect and. Cost to eke or I. So we half. Like reduction. Up to five and a half block units. As a prop in all. Ninety percent has less often effect. Than at an old fifty percent. So fifty percent is more effective than ninety percent. Which dehydrates the cells. How might this constant. Is active in all of the concentrations that we applied to three one point three per. Sense of so powerful. But there's an effect and. Here we see the effect of bleach. Eighty percent. Causes an activation of around four log units. And four percent. Quite a typically has more effect than eight percent so it's kind of strange result. But that's what we've got in the student lap the other week. Barack sides. Only reach a tree. Like units reduction so it's not furry. Active. And that is because the organism. Equalize contains the enzyme satellites that integrates. Proc sites. Have acquired a good effect. But it's a concentration. Has an effect as well. So that kind of. A typical this test was done on a standardized optimum optimized conditions there was no dirt presence and. He called I went in there for five minutes after five minutes. Their reaction was stopped. And then the organisms were played and there was no dearth of presence. Because if you have to present the situation can be quite difficult. Different and difficult. This is an order. Experiments where we have four different organisms. And try to this. But still a serious. And they are applied in a sponge. And it's a dirty use. Point. We put this punch in the engine microbial liquids. And we add the low to milk so ten percent milk. In salt solution. And directly after. That's the inoculation. We have around ten to six pts. And a dark blue bar. That has six microorganisms per point. Then we leave the sponges Indian to microbial liquids for the whole mites. And the next day. We're going to count and then you expect that the number of organisms has gone down. That was not. The case. In this country microbial liquids. Eco life he was able to grow some of that right to this. States more or less the same. So. Was true for most of the serious stuff. Produce a little bit. But not that much. So. Antibacterial liquids. Has not always in a fact especially when dirt is present and also be a fact. Off. But that's a fact and on organisms. Differs. Even within the same. Organism a fact may differ. And that's shown in this experiment. Here. We have one organism. It was a stereo monitor tawdriness. And we apply. Seventeen milligram polluter. Of Aquash. Which is bands all coding in chlorides. We have a list area. Grown into cells here. Were cultivated. Until the stationary face. So they were at the end of their growth before they went into experiments. And the other group of cells was grown to the exponential face. And both were applied to say treatments. And here. It shows the percentage survival. And he you can see that in the stationary face cells cells that were not actively growing. They were hardly affected by the death and affected. While the growing cells in their exponential face. Reduced quickly. So even within one organism. Some stereo here. There isn't a fact of great culture in conditions that has an effect on this effect and so things are not that easy. To summarize a key to good. Disaffection is good cleaning because if George is around. This infection. Is far less than you expect. And a proper disinfectant needs to be chosen. Also depends on the situation in a food factory. And on the organisms that are there. And I'm sure bacterial effect of it as a fact and. Needs to be tested under relevant conditions. If they're still dirt. They're also tested with third.",

                "text": "This clip. Is to create awareness as to the importance of hygiene and design and to show you some examples of hygienic. And on high achieving decide. That's first look at a definition. Hygienic equipment is equipment that can be cleaned and freed from relevant micro-organisms. It does not mean that the equipment. Is clean. But that equipment can be kings. And that look. Let us look at an example of equipment that can not be kings. Here we have a cup link between two pipes. Pipe one pipe two. And it's connected here with a couple of. The upper part is pipe one. The lower part is a pipe two. And this coupling. Connects to two. And it's a non hygienic coupling. If we now look at a left turn. Barge. And we zoom in. Then we see here. That there is an LS somewhere seal. That to make sure that the coupling. Stace where it should be. And its couple. The stainless steel of five one and pipe two and at this moment. This pipeline. Is being cleaned. To screening fluid in green here. Running short of pipeline. But there's also some product residue remaining in a crevice. Between the two parts of the coupling. And in this gravest there is one. Little furry. Happy. Bacteria that pass. Food enough to multiply. Before the next morning. It will half grown and multiply it's to many many organisms. And then the next batch. It is able to contaminate. So this is a non heart unique. Coupling and. It will be a source of contemplation. The next day. This is a design mistake. A sense of hygiene a these are in is having a good design that is clean of all this is not clean it will. If you clean. And the equipment is not suitable. You can clean whatever you want. You won't be successful. Any cleaning. And there's infection failed. If equipment is not suitable. That is very important in the design. And should be. All right and then on top of that it needs to be cleaned. But the design. Should be good. Otherwise. It's no use cleaning. Let's look at some more examples. This is a gutter. Through which water flows away from. Foot production area. And it is a very well. Clean able. Because you can take off the upper part. You can clean underneath. And then reassembly again. If the situation looks like this it is far less easy for difficult to cling to clean this. You need to spend a lot of hours. Which will probably not be done. And if there is to say to a shim like this wonders a motor. Of a pump. Underneath about an dust fault soft about. This is not clean I'm all at all. So this is a very unhygienic design. Let's look at some more examples. Drainage professionals is also very important. This vessel is not draining will this one isn't either. And during. Cleaning the product residue stays in there. During rinsing. Product residue. And cleaning fluid three main in there and during disaffection. After doesn't affection. A whole makeshift space in there. And the next batch will be contaminate. For vassals. This design is much better. The liquids can flow out at the lowest point. So drainage. At the lowest point is an essence of hygiene if you sign. Another essence is. Rounded and. If they're shy. Actions. Drugs will accumulate in the edge. It's very difficult to remove. If the radius of this action is more than three millimeters. It's usually. No problem. Well clinical. Well this affected them so I want to examples that ends are very difficult. Because product residues. Stays in there. Will not be cleaned. Will not be disinfected and. This is really a problem so the prevention of that. And during this time. Is crucial. But let us return to the different hygienic equipments. Comes into class a class one. Equipment's death can be cleaned. In place. You don't have to take anything apart. Cleaning a quick flow through rinsing liquid flows through and then relevant microorganisms can be removed. Class two is also hard to take. But you have to take apart some parts have to be taken away. After dismantling. Then it's reassembled again. And then it can be disaffected. To a sufficient extent. So it's not necessarily. Batch. Hygiene equipment. Always is intact. During cleaning. It may be necessary that you need to take some Bart. Some parts off. But can both be. Archie Nick. On top of that equipment. May also be a sceptic. That means that it's an high cheek. And sterilize a ball. And that it is. Impermeable. During microorganisms. During production. That is a septic equipment so that's hygienic. Plus something else. Guidelines for hygiene equipment. A septic equipment. Have been written down by several organizations. The definitions here world. Were taken from. He had. But there is several organizations. Active world wives who work on the design of hygiene. Equipments. He had in Europe many in Europe. Three A and S. F. in the America us. If you want more information on standards and guidelines and search occasion this is the organizations that provide us. With this not much help I hope to have shown you that hygiene and these are and it's clean ability. From these trying on.",

                "text": "This knowledge gap is to introduce you to the basics. Of cleaning and its importance for food production and food so. If we look at a different mission of cleaning as defined by Codex Alimentarius. It's read the removal of soil. Food residues Durch greenies and anything out or any order. Objectional matter. No mentioning. Of my carcass and its meat. In this definition. That's kind of strange because. Microorganisms. Are affected by caning to a large extent. And let's look towards the food residues. That remain on the surface if it's not cleaned well. Have an effect on microorganisms. Because their source of nutrients. Microorganisms see this as food. And they will start growing. For look at a bacterial growth growth and we start with let's say one hundred cells. Per centimeter. Militar. Then after a short while child like face they start to grow exponentially. And they may reach the stationary face of numbers off. Maybe ten to the eight to ten to the nines microorganisms. Per milliliter. So within a day. Depending on the temperature at the top of church. Jerks may have become a source of. Millions and millions off. Unwanted organisms. And if you then need to start and clean and that's a fact. You start with an enormous enormous number of organisms. So cleaning. It's very important because dirt. Is a source of nutrients and leads to the formation of many more. Organisms than we originally starts with. But there's more. If there is gorge. And we should. And which start and that's in fact. Than. The layer of dirt. Protects the organisms physically from the effect off that doesn't. And that comes by micro-organisms are protected. Physically but also chemically. Because Did that affect us. React with the dirt. Rather than with the organisms and. A large part of this in fact and then. Goes last. And as a fourth. Important aspect is that. Equipment such as he took changes or any other. Contract material. It's performance is decreased if there's a layer of dirt on there. That there's a in almost a fact of food residues on microbes and on food production. Cleaning and there's infection are not to say. There's a difference. Good cleaning. Causes of reduction of approximately fifty to ninety percent of the microorganisms present so it's generally less than one block reduction while. Good. Doesn't faction. According to standards. Has a five block reduction. That means that ninety nine dollars ninety nine nine percent of the organisms are killed. Cleaning removed the dirt. And in a trance. And in that way has an effect on organisms. This infection removes the microorganisms to a certain level. It will not result in. Completes to reality. There's a fire reduction. The main a fact of cleaning. On microorganisms that. It removes the nutrients and prevent growth but. Cleaning in chime is as important as this infection. Not how to decide to appropriate the cleaning way. In the first place we need to know what the soil is and assault can be added. Art or. An organic or. Organic. And I'm going to for example cost my heart water. Water that contains a large amount. All far. Calcium and magnesium carbonates. Metallic Durch. It's not that prevalent in food industry but it can be addressed and over time. Or it can be alkaline. That is caused by foam of alkali cleaning agents. More important for food industry are organic swells caused by. The food itself of course. Or petroleum. For example from labor cation also a grease in the British an oil and grease. Is to try puff oil that you use if the machinery goes like. You put a bullet or put a bit of oil. And then. The machinery. Runs smoothly again. It typically causes a lot of dirt. And it needs to be cleaned. That's also non-petroleum organic residue. For example animal fats. Of actionable on us and after knowing the nature of the soil. The tripe of cleaning solution can be determined. From mineral soils. The best detergent. Its assets. There reasonably soil will in water. They're reasonably easy to remove. And also upon heating. The capability doesn't change. For proteins that's difficult. They are not soluble in water. And if you heat it. It gets even worse because the protein sticks to the surface and sticks to itself. Because of the proteins D.N.A.. Nature rising. The best internment Dirge and for protein. Is growing a total alkaline detergents. Fats and oils. Not soil and will not easily removeable because they stick together. Upon heating. Alkaline detergents. Is best to remove fats and oils. For carbohydrates. They're reasonably slow be able. But. Up on heating. Think about a pan that got burnt. It's more difficult to remove. And the best detergent is alkaline. Knowing in general. The best detergent. We need to look at the tree important aspects of cleaning. That is. Mechanical force. Can. Force like we just saw. Assets. Alkaline or neutral. And the process of process parameters. Mechanical force is important to apps. To do chemical force. For example. To brush my hand or. Vacuum. Steam cleaning. Can also be done. It really improves. The power of the cleaning. High pressure. That's a swell phone. And gels. Improved to chime that the cleaning agents stays around and. In that way help. Mechanical force and. See IP means. Cleaning in place. That is done in close. Machinery. Close pipelines. Close to vessels and cleaning liquids. Is pumped. With high speed. True. All the parts off the equipment. So that it gets cleaned and that is usually done with alkaline. These are all. Ways to generate. Mechanical force to loosen the dirt and to get rid of detritus on surfaces. Very important other chime that cleaning as implied the temperature. The composition. Off. The cleaning solution in general and the concentration of the detergents in there. And one component that is everywhere present. Is water water. Dissolved. The water soluble contact. Takes it away also during rinsing. So it's very important. But. Hard water. Brings also a problem. Hot water is water with a lot of ions of calcium and magnesium. And it forms deposits. Like here in the water boarding or. They stick the heating surface. And they're difficult to remove the only way to remove them. Is to treat them with assets. And that's a common way off. Treating this church. Asset also causes corrosion so this is something you don't want to do every day. Most cleaning daily. On a daily basis. It's not done with assets with alkaline. Or caustic. In stainless steel and rubber. Not without a medium. Because there it wears away them out I mean you. And it's also not gone. When humans are present so it's not. It's only dawn. In machinery it cannot be done in hand it would be toxic. And those process in. Process in which acids and alkaline are not suitable. Then detergents are used. As you may have seen in chemical plastics. Detergents consist of a bowler hats and. A parlor Chaillot. They form ourselves and if they help in this solving their soil. It also helps in wetting the surfaces. So dat. The surface. Let's let's go off to Dorchester six two under. As you may have seen. The church is coming all are a lot. Kind of off. Of types and. If you look on what is written on. Detergents. You may see that there is questioning agents in there those agents keep. Soil in solution. They prevent a deposits and they help to rinse away. The Dirt. Sometimes they're called. She latent agents. That also might be oxidized her friends there. They also have a. Disinfectant. Effect so they kill. Microorganisms. But their main aim. In a detergent. Is started to great proteins the most difficult. Elements to do great and so while there may be corrosion Perec protectant in there to protect machinery and equipment at your heart at home. Protective color why it's my being there. So a cleaning agent like this is composed of a lot of different elements. To summarize cleaning. Is to remove all of dirt. Microorganisms are removed as well. But that's not to me. It requires mechanical. Chemical force. It needs to be done in a suitable way. And chime don't believe it to the next day. Because microorganisms will have grown. And it's sometimes followed by. This infection.",

                "text": "Hello there. Welcome to this. Eighth. Clip on multiple regression. In this clip we're going to discuss the call and you have it. Let me first show you on the map where we are. Well actually we're approaching the end of this. In this part we go on to look at some topics that might go wrong every question and multi-collinearity is one of these problems. First recall. The example about Plan damage ship we've seen before. So we have a requestion situation here the response variable wise about Plan damage measured in some way. And there are two requests is that the requests are X. one indicating the ammonia concentration in the air and there is an X two. Which is the ozone. Concentration in year. There are two scatterplots share of ammonia first as damage. And as Zone first as damage. And we see strongly relationships between. The requests and the response. OK if we go on to fit a multiple in your question model. Here at the bottom. The model is specified. And we go in to see what's happening. So what is the result from the regression. So here is the only outcome from the multiple regression. We have requests why on X. one on ammonia and on. Was own. And let's look here it appears values for the T. test. And. Look here we have people use which are large in a five percent those three tests are not significant. On the other hand. Look at the P. value over here which is the P. value for the omnibus after us. And it is highly significant. That's one we could also do the simple regressions we could reverse the why the plan then match on those own story. Here or on. Ammonia separately. And if we now look at the P. values for the T. days we see that we have highly significant results. So these things may or may be just considered strange. So what's happening here. Outcomes. Well we already talked about this before. The reason is correlation among regresses there's a strong. Linear relationship. Among ammonia and I was alone and. You clearly see that here in this sketch a plot of their own first is ammonia that's one first X. two. This is strongly the relationship between the two. And actually the correlation is close two point nine nine. Is extremely high. If you think about it if you have a model that already contains Somalia. And you will add a zone to it then. Your model will not improve a lot. So you will have non-significant T. test in the multiple repression. On the other hand if you have a model that contains only the intercept and I think elf. And then you add I was alone than you it will improve greatly. So you will have highly significantly testing the simple request. The problem here. That we see if you have multiple requests is called multi-collinearity. If a regress here is perfectly related to other ie Chrysis. You could call this. Perfect multi-collinearity and then the problem is see fear there is not even a unique solution to the least Quest problem. In practice. It usually is not that bad. You may have nearly perfect relationships between requests is like in the example of a more ya know Zone. So we have nearly Milty collinearity. And in that case to be task the slopes of the requests are poorly determined. And the standard errors of the slopes are relatively large. So let's have a look at the standard Evison the multiple regression. And in the simple requests sions. So for instance focusing on the standard areas of the slope for I'm only out point three zero two from the multiple regression. Point zero for three. From. Simple requests. So we see here that. The standard there is almost seven times as large in a multiple regression compared to the simple equation. OK The multi-collinearity of a regress or X J. In a set of regress S.. It may be measured by. What's called R J squared. So you are desperate it is a fraction explain fairy ation. But it is not the squared by replacing Y. but it's awkward by requesting the X. J itself. On the other axis. So it indicates how well X.J. can be replaced by a combination of other axis. It is a fraction explained. Variation So it ranges from zero to one. If it is ZERO done X. J. cannot be predicted. At all from your axis and. If it would be one then it can be perfectly predicted from your order X. axis. Based on this. R J squared we can calculate a ferry and. Variance inflation factor. Of X J. If ya F. Which is one zero for one minus R.J. square and. Well if R.J.. Ranges from zero to one. Then the few. Will range. Just fill in these values of R.J.. It will range from one to infinity. Now. Typically a cutoff value is used for free I HAVE equal to ten so if the FIA af. For aggressor is larger than ten. Then. Be careful. You may do something about the situation. Actually this is called a fairy and. Inflation factor because it tells you how much different fermions is increased by this multi-collinearity. Here is the formula and it's not very important. But it it's it's nice to illustrate if the formula for the standard error of a slope of course is a three party you have the standard deviation of the ever. Here you see a part in the square root. Which tells you about the fare evasion of the X.J. itself. The larger the ferry ation of X J. The smaller the standard ever the better the slope is determined. And here is the few I have. So it is just part of the standard ever formula. So with multiple regression if the FIA as would be ten. Then if areas of the slope. Is ten times as large compared to the ferry and. Simple repression situation. In the example that we have here. To calculate the few I asked which is. DONE IN OUR with a few I function. We get forty five point six. So this is much much higher than the threshold value of ten and. We can. This tell you make sense we have already seen that the standard errors in the multiple regression were about seven times larger than in simple requests so if we squared a seven week at this we get very close to this. Forty five point six that we have here. So caution is required here. So I have a question for you so now we switch to a situation of designed experiment. So here we have as an experiment where we want to find out the effects of nitrogen and force for a given five levels. On the crop yield. So is this a properly designed experiment to stop the clip for a moment think about it. And then return. OK well. The answer. Of course is. This is not a properly designed experiment. If we would calculate the FIA as. Of nitrogen and phosphorus here. It would be infinit. You see that there is a perfect linear relationship between the. And the P. values here. The N. failures are just ten times as large as the P. values. This is a lousy experimental design. This complete confound. Between N. and P. and it will be impossible to disentangle the effects of nitrogen and phosphorous. Well what can you do about. Multi-collinearity there's not a real cure. But you can take some precautions. So you could limit the number of X. variables in the model. So make and you disease. Choice beforehand. And if. On biological grounds for instance. To fables can be expected to be strongly related to use only one of them in your. Regression model. Inspect the correlations among potential troubles before hand. And in an observational studies then the X. variables that you have seen may be strongly related to your sample and maybe India in the line population or not. But this cannot be remedied any more. In an experimental study. On the other hand control control the X. for both yourself. So that the problem. Need not occurred. And if necessary you could switch to another method and least squares and. Once you have fitted the model. Inspect the standard there is Inspector fee I ass. And. You may try to fit models. With a subset of the X. variables. As well and see what happens in summary. Mota collinearity deals with correlation. Among a set of requests and. If it happens then the requests are maybe be placed on nearly every place by a linear combination of. Other because. And it may lead to. Poorly determined slopes. With high standard errors. And it may even cause numerical problems. But least question is if your cases. The Seri ation inflation factor is a useful quantity which is. One over one minus an object squared. And if you are fell you are larger than ten. Indicates problems. And you side experiments. Multi-collinearity. Can be afforded by proper experimental design. Thanks for your attention. See you in the next and final clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello there. Welcome to the second clip on the regression. In this clip we go one can discuss. Checking the assumptions. Let me show you on a map where we are. Well we've seen a lot already about multiple regression we've seen least squares and you know for table we have seen the T. test and you have tests and goodness of fit criteria and now we approach the end. We're here. Checking the assumptions. Well let's first recall the assumptions. For multiple regression. Here is the multiple regression model. We ride why has the sum of a systematic part. And a parental part. And we have assumptions that are in a part and we have. Assumptions. Or systematic part. Well first looking at the right random parking. Actually we are looking down at year terms epsilon I and we suppose we assume that those. Ever terms. Are independent. Come from a normal distribution and have a constant variance or so called Homo skew the city for the systematic part. Well we issue. That the mean of why the response can be written as this linear function of the axis. In other words. That Y. is not systematically lower or higher than this. Linear function or. The difference between Y. and its linear function which only the first. Just very. Randomly. Around zero. A graphical. Depiction of these assumptions the give is given here. We see a normal distribution. Around zero with. A constant standard deviation sic maps of. Well the assumption checking is important especially for the statistical inference for. I purpose is that you have tests and. The T. test for confidence intervals. Now not all assumptions are equally important most important is the independence. The constant fair interest. Sumption come second. And normality. Is the least important one. Due to the central limit theorem. First a few words about the assumption of independence that's a difficult one it's not easily checked by making a few graphs. And it should merely follow. From a proper study design. I think about random a station random sampling. Things like that. The other assumptions. Can be checked by making some graphs based on research evils. So let's go back to reset your goals. What is the residual. Well. She remember. Every said You will hear called. The difference between the observed why. And the predicted Y. according to the fitted model. So it's wind minus Y. hat. And the research will eat I is a realization of the ever. Epsilon. But it's not the error itself. The error cannot be observed. So for instance even if the errors epsilon I have a constant fear when stand the visuals do not have a constant variance. The ferry and so for every stage will depend solely axis. So for that reason it's slightly better to look at what's called Student ties which should you goals. Which are very said you will defy the own standard ever. Well a student ties research you all is a standardized variable meaning that the ferry into is equal to one. So that's nice because now we know what to expect. For such a student guy's usage of its normal distribution hold. Now the question for you. Suppose we have an observation. Where the student as we said you will is equal to six. Meaning that the predicted Y is six hundred errors apart from the observed. Line. What do you conclude. And what do you conclude if a student actually said you would be for instance minus one. So stop the clip for a moment think about it and return. Hello again so here is the answer. The student as we said you will is a standardized. Variance is one. And maybe recall a property of the standard normal distribution. That ninety five percent of the file use of of a standard normal distribution are in the range of minus two to two. And more than ninety nine point seven percent. Are in the range between minus three in C.. So fell used outside the range minus these three are highly unlikely to occur. If you so much as I met. So here we had an observation with a student eyes decision to six. So that means clearly that we are outside his range. And it means that one or more of the symptoms are not met. We have an outlier here and something has to be as to be done about it. If we have just an observation with student eyes decision. To minus one there is no problem. Let's go to the second. Assumption normality. So to check normality. You typically make. Q.Q. QUANTRILL quanta up lots of to receive jewels or. The student I.C.C. tools. And in a Q-Q. plot you plot the received rolls first as the expected values that you expect from a standard normal distribution. And if all is well then. Those points fall approximately on the straight line. Let's go back to an example we've seen before. Before about the cholesterol data so the response was that the cholesterol ratio. There were four requests in four ft. And in our. We can easily check assumptions that make by making some residual parts. With the plot function. You just pluck. The linear model. Object here into this plot function and the result is a nice array of residual plots. The Q-Q. plot. You find here. And if we and larch it. We see this. So this is a normal Q.Q. plot. For the standardized. Student ties the syllables. And we see that the points are not on a straight line therefore here on a curved line so obviously something is wrong here. We do not have normality here. The third assumption is the extension of constant. Variance of homo scale is this city. For that you could make every seed your plot of the SHOULD YOU ALL student eyes whistles on the Y. axis. First is the predicted values on the X. axis and. Forward a constant fair interception. Assumption to hold. We expect. Variation in the Y. direction. To be constant. And. Well have a look at this a ray of the central part once again. We find the relevant part of this position. So the ordinary residual supporters here are on the Y. axis and if it is high used to predict its values on the X. axis. Well then maybe in this example slide indications of the stay city. It seems to me that the ferry ation is slightly smaller. For small predicted values the larger predicted values. Compared to the middle. We will come back at you in the practical. Then a fourth assumption. That's the assumption of linearity or a correct systematic part. For that you could make or receive your plot of the city of Austin a Y. axis again first history. Individual regress on the X. axis and. For a correct systematic part. We expect there we said you was to be randomly distributed around zero at and evaluate the requests. So actually the receiver plot is not part of disarray of plots that. We've seen before. So we have to do a little bit extra work here to make this plot so here the recent divorce are extracted from the linear model object. And here we plot to reseed us first as X. one in this case which is the age. And what we see. Here that any value of X.. Roughly speaking. We said you always have to mean equal to zero which is fine. So that assumption of linearity seems to hold a banana should receive your plot like this. Would spell problems. Here we see that for small values of X. one we have negative received us. Here we have positive residuals and there we have negativity Jools again. So the systematic trends are not captured. That properly. A few more words about regression diagnostics. Outliers. Left her chin influence. So outlier is an observation with an extreme wife L.-U. compared to order. Observations with similar X. values. So here's an example so here we have some data points. With the least square lines plotted in. And suppose we have this extra point here. Well we see that it deviates strongly. From order. Of sufficient with comparable X. value so we would call this a regression outlier. This would have a strong effect on the really if we include this point into the real question we get the retrogression mind that you see small changes but it's not dramatically. So now we go on to look at what's called less rich. So one high leverage point is a data point with an extreme. X. value. Where we ignore Y. A completely. And such a point potentially influences. The question slopes. So let's have a look at an example here are some data points with the least where lines plotted in Suppose we have an extra ups of Haitian. Located here well it's. You see on the X. axis that it's quite far away from the other. X. values. So this is an observation with a high leverage this it haven't. A large influence here not really. If we. Fit to requestion line including this point we get the green line only a small difference with the blue line. But here is another example. Here we have an ops. And the Red Dot here. It has the same. X. coordinate so it has the same high leverage as the Green Point. And the wire coordinate is different now. Such a point has a much stronger influence on the requestion including the point leads to the rhetoric wish him. So high leverage point it potentially influences. The big question slopes but not necessarily. And finally and high influenced. Influential point. Is an observation that strongly. Influences three question slopes. And the last point. We saw in the earlier slide is an example of such a point. This is a point. Both at the high left in its outlying and. It influences the regression drastically. So be aware of those. Possible problematic points. In summary. So use. We said you're also a student I three said you will still check normal assumptions. To check them on assumptions. Independence assumptions is not easily checked. It should merely follow from a proper study design. The normality assumption is checked out make normal Q-Q. parts of the residual student ties usage rules and you're happy. If the points are approximately on the straight line. The constant variance assumption. Is checked by making every Should people first this prediction scatter plot. And you are happy. If you have equal variation in the Y. direction. At any value of the. At any predictive value. And for. Linearity or a correct systematic part make a part of the said you will see first is a regressive. And you're happy. If the mean received will is about zero and the value of X.. We where of regression outliers. Points and high influential points and especially the last. Points are dangerous. They can influence. Results in revisions and dramatically. Thanks for your tension as you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "You know in this clip I'm going to explain to you about it's the. Determinants of behavior. That's part of the first step. Of intervention mapping. The needs assessment. So what is the determinants for basically determinants is of course it's on search to why I question. So for example. Why do people have lung cancer or. Why do people smoke or. Why they are getting people. Depressed. That's all. Cause us off. Health or causes of behavior. And we distinguish between. Behavioral determinants of health and. Determinants of behavior. And for example behavioral determinants of health. Could be smoking. This kind of contribution to lung cancer. So a behavioral cause of lung cancer. Is smoking. Then what is the determinant of behavior Well those are the courses. Off the behavior smoking. So why do people smoke. And it's going to be for example. Peer pressure. Or because people do not know the consequences of smoking for their health. Those are all determinants of a behavior. And if you look at the. Preceded model. Then you see if A C three. That we're talking about. The behavioral determinants of health. So all the behaviors she does cause a health problem. And in face for we are looking at the determinants of the behavior. So does NOT A determinants of behavior such as smoking. Why is it so important to get an idea of. The determinants of behavior. Well if you would like to do something about lung cancer. You have to do something. Amongst others. About the smoking behavior of people. And to change this smoking behavior. You need to look at the cause us. Of this behavior. So and. Those are the determinants of behavior so you need to give them information. For example. So increase that knowledge. Or you need to persuade people to change their attitude. Give. Arguments why it's important to quit smoking. Or you need to train people skills or selfishly give them confidence that they can actually quit smoking. Or you can also mean you may need to do something about their environment. Creates an environment where smoking is not steady easy. For example. That's people are not allowed to smoke in certain areas or in a building. Those are all the terminals of behavior and so. To be able to change behavior you need to do something about the cause us of their behavior so it's very important to get a good idea about what actually. Are these determinations. And the importance and the relevance of these determines it's varies. So for each behavior. It's going to be very difference. For example for smoking. Most of the people know that smoking is causing. Health problems. So. Knowledge is very often. Notes. An important determinant of. Smoking behavior. But it's maybe for exercising or eating healthy. Knowledge might be much more important so it depends on the behavior. Which determinants is the most important also to change. But you first need to know did you first need to find out. It's going to also vary between groups for example smoking behavior can be very different among adults. Or among youth. Be a pressure. Might be much more influential among youth. Then. Among adults. So. Determinants also vary between groups. And it's going to also vary between settings. For example for a young person it might be much more difficult to resist. Pierce. In the school. Then. To not smoke at home. So also the setting. Can be very different so it's important to get a good picture of all the difference. Behaviors. Settings and groups. If you are analyzing. Smoking behavior or any other. Behavior. Well if you look at determinants of nutrition related behaviors. There are quite a number for example. Biological determinants for example I like something or I don't like it or. I am hungry or not. Economic determinants. For example people may think that healthy food is more expensive than. Unhealthy food. People just don't have the money to pay more for healthy food. Physical determinants that this access to I have access to healthy food. Social Determinants this influence. You know what kind of family your environment if you grow up. Of mill patterns also of course play an important role in that. Psychological determinants. If I'm. If I have stress I may eat more than. If I don't have stress. And also social cognitive determinants. For example attitudes believes knowledge skills. And if you look at food choices or behaviors. Here are all the difference kinds of factors that may influence. The choices that we make. When it's comes to food or. Intake. And in this. Course you will mainly learn about the person related factors. So does add a social cognitive factor she does influence behavior. And we also look at the environmental factors. Because those are all sort of factors that you can do something about if you are developing an intervention program. Then it is important to make it to distinction between personal determinants and external determinants. And which you also see in a previous flights the person already. Determines and environmental or external. Determinants of personal determinants are person related. There are within me. It's my needs. My beliefs. Where is the external determinants are in my environments for example the accessibility. Of food or certain influence from. Family or peers. And in an intervention. That focuses on me. You will mainly focus on the personal the terminus because it's something that you can change within me. Where is the Excel determines you often need to focus your intervention. On others. Those are beyond the control of me as a person. It's important to have that's distinction. And if you look at social influence. Both of these elements are there. There is an external compliment. So they can be. Actual support or pressure of fear. But they're also a personal component. Components to that because it might also be my perception that my peers. Smoke or that's all of my peers. Don't eat healthy food. So it's going. There's a personal part. My own perception. And there is an actual. Part. Which. And he were intervention you Philip and you have to also take That's very good. Into account. So in this clip. I think explained to you about the importance of exploring the terminus of behavior. And also the distinction between. Personal and. External determinants. Thank you.\n",

                "text": "You know I'm going to explain you about the steps in qualitative research. There are basically not that difference from quantitative research. But of course the contents of each step. Is different because you use different methods and also the analysis of qualitative research is different. These are to six steps. First. Of course state your research question. Then select respond. And train. Data collectors. Then select and design data collection methods. Then the data collection itself. And the analysis of findings and finally there are reports of findings. So first. Stating a research question. First in qualitative research. Think very thorough early. Whether the research. Aims at describing a phenomenon or a situation. Whether it's. Exploratory. So why. How and are standing. A certain problem. Or are you testing. Something. Are you just looking. Whether a certain intervention works or not. So you are assessing Dan Rather your you have both is correct or not. But it's more related to evolution. Research. After you say that your research question so. You know what the aim of your research is. Then you select. Respondents and data collectors. If you select respondents. It is advisable to select a sample that is somehow. Presented TAFE. Of your target group or of the group that you would like to study. And then continue with selecting people and collecting information. Until they tell us that a ration achieves. So that means that Hugh do nots. Collects new information any more. And yeah a rule of thumb is that this is approximately about fifteen. Interviews with people from the same population. So for example if you. Into few fifteen. Elderly people. And fifteen young people. Then. Approximately. You get to the point that you do not get new information from these two groups anymore. And other thing that you need to do in this stage is strangulation of respondents. So if you do research among elderly people don's only into few of the elderly people but also interviewed a partnership or into a few people around them. Like caregivers. Or others in their social environment. And then another part of this is to select data collectors and especially in qualitative research. It's very important to have people who can do good qualitative research. So who can do good interviews or group discussions. And who are trained to do it it's an importance in this is also here. Triangulation. So try to work with. More than one. Interviewer. So that you get from different. INTERVIEWER she gets the information. Which contributes to the validity of your findings. Then the third step is to select the zine methods. Also here. Triangulation try to use more than one method. So combine interviews with observations. Focus group discussions. Analysis of existing documents or information. Then these signed the instruments and then also test them and see whether the language is right rather the length. Is OK. By the people that you interview or you do a group discussion with. Whether you get a good response from them. And also cultural sensitivity if that applies. Take that into account when you are testing your methods. Then the fourth step is to data collection itself. And here there's importance to have a clear. Introduction. So explain to the people you interview or did you talk through. What the aim is of your research. Ask for consent. So. Ask questions emphasize anonymity so that people also feel free to say what they would like to say and therefore right to stop with the interview at any time. That's of course the same for. Quantitative research as well. In quantitative research it's really nice if you can use a recorder. But of course you need to ask for permission to use this recorder and. Record the whole interview or a group discussion. If you do a group discussion so that's usually with a group of six or seven. People always make sure that there is one person who does the interview who asked the questions. And there's also someone who takes notes. Because you know group discussion it's after some signs difficult. So here who has been saying what. Importance in qualitative research is a quiet setting. That there is no interference from people walking in a certain room or. If you're sitting in a group that people come in that's also relates to creating a safe setting. Too and it's very important to make sure that people do not give a shit. That are that they think that he would like to hear. And finally very important and also very difficult. Is to ask. Open questions and not. Close to question. Yes so don't ask questions where people only have to say yes or no. But ask why did you do this and this and this and then you will get a story. Instead of asking. Did you go to the shop yesterday. Are not. There you will only get the short answer. And you will not get information. Or discussion. That you would like to get. Then Step five fifty and now this is off the quantitative data. And this is. Yeah this is one of the most difficult parts of the whole research. Qualitative Research. Because as a researcher and also as a data analyst. The person who does the data analysis. You play a very important role as a person. It depends on what you see in the data what you read in the data. Objectivity is much more difficult in qualitative data and evidence than in quantitative data analysis. So what you need to do is to identify the most important findings. And that's going to be because many people have mentioned certain elements or a certain factor. But it can also be that only a few people mention it but it's very unexpected. And of course you identified that's information that is relevant for your own research. Then there are also two ways of looking at your data. Inductive and deductive. Index of means. Bottom up. So you do not use a framework you just look at your data and from that you try to identify certain patterns or certain. Important. Important factors. This is also referred to assert ground of theory. Another approach is the directive. And that means that you start with your. Either your research question or. With a theoretical model. You use that as a framework to look at your data. But these are two very different approaches. And of course. In reading. The data. You do a lot of interpretation and. Sometimes people say things in an interview. Not directly but indirectly and. So it's also a skill as a qualitative researcher to read between the lines and also find that information bring that's on the table during your analysis of data. Very practically what you can do is to develop a tree. With soap get to Greece. Which is the index of. Index if. Approach. So. Bottom up. And what you can do is identify difference categories and put your coat on that's. Build a model. Yourself. Identify subcategories highlights optional quotes so people have a saying that illustrates a certain finding your qualitative data. I like this for that you don't forget it. And in this process. All the time you are revising and refining your categories. In your model. Some other tips for data analysis. What what I sometimes see is that qualitative research is also bring in some quantitative aspects so day. Counts for example the number of times people have used a certain word. You can do deaths. But it's important to know that you should not approach qualitative research in a quantitative way. So numbering or counting the times that people say something is less important. Then bring about a whole story or a whole picture. What you can do. Especially if you have a lot of data you can use software and there are a lot of progress. It's like a class nudist or and if you go. But if you have very little they said then usually it's. It's not necessary to learn. Such a program. And you can also do it with words. Or even write things. Or print. Things on paper and use markers to identify. Different categories. And also here again triangulation tries to involve more than one person in the analysis of the data. Because then you may have two or three different people. Looking at the same data. And they may bring about. Difference. Information. Because they look at it in a different way. Then finally. Report. About the findings. It's very important to be very modest. In the way you present your results. So say. Use virtue like. It appears deaths. Or it seems that. And do not state your findings as if. These are very protective. Findings it's going to generalize. So be modest in the way you describe it and use quotes to illustrate the most important findings and make sure that you show views of different groups of respondents for example. Parents said this but. The young people said that. And very important to. Reflects on your data collection procedure. And your instruments. And also sometimes. Your own role as an investigator. Because you are actually part of the instruments to collect the information. So in this clip. I've explained to you about. Different steps in doing qualitative research. That you can use very practically. If you do your own research in practice. Thank you.\n",

                "text": "Hello my name's Christian bomb. And today I'd like to talk to you about exploiting the Machel ingenuity. That is evolved in the interaction between bacteria and plants. We want to see if we can utilize this ingenuity. For improvement of Agriculture. Now a soil bacterium called agro bacterium. To my face and contains a large. Plasmid. That is responsible for transferring its natural. Genes. To plants in order to produce. Openings. Compounds which you can utilize a cattle Bligh's. For its own resources. As a natural. Carbon and nitrogen source. These genes are expressed in structures around. The root calls that are sort of callous like structures. That will produce these are pins than allow agro bacterium. To live and thrive in amongst the cells of the producing the opiates. Now some time ago. People have thought of ways to utilize this system. To transfer their own favorite genes. Into plants and to genetically modified. Plants by human beings we. And I'll show you on the board here. We know. The components. Of natural T.-I plasmids. Have these borders which. Specify the region. Of T.D.M.A. or. Human D.N.A. that's transferred into the plant and. The rest of the plasma It contains things like. Origin of replication and variants and catabolism genes. So how could we mimic Pilate. This you launch plasmid which is quite difficult to work with into something that we can use. As a vector system. For the transformation of plants. Well the transformation of the components of transformation vectors. Are the border us. We need these borders. Because that specifies what part of the plasmid is transferred into plants. The on could genes. Essentially we don't need. Those And we probably will have to delete those the very G.D.. Region. Is another region which specifies the proteins involved in the actual transformation. The transfer of D.N.A. from the bacterial cell to the plant itself so we will need those the triad genes allow the plasma to be transferred from one bacterium. To the other bacteria. Not necessarily required for us. An Origin of transfer. Well we don't need that either. But we do need an origin of replication. So this plasmid will be replicated in the bacterium. What more will we need. What we might need a selectable mark on both. To tell us that the bacterium that. We're working with. Contains the plasmid and. In the plant. We would like to be able to select those cells that have been transformed with our construct in our favorite gene. And so we may need selectable markers for the plant as well. And we may need a region of T.D.M.A. where we always will want to insert our genes so that means. We might need a cloning site of one sort or another. What don't we need well as I said before. We don't really need the younger genes we don't want to produce crown goals. In our agricultural plants. So we want to delete those on could humans. What may we need. What we may need regulation signals. So. Promoters that direct expression of our favorite gene. Into the tissue and. Into to be expressed at a less. Well another time when we think it is necessary. So for example if we want to change flower color. We obviously need to express our. Pigmentation gene. In the petals. Else we won't. It's no point having them expressed in the roots. If we want to change the flower color. So components of trans these. Vectors well. We have a T.D.M.A.. So that's what we're going to focus on with the borders and. We have these other regions where we need the very regional region of. Replication. But we don't need this on Project region. So which How will we combine these. Well the. Plasmid. The T.-I plasmid this very large and it's very difficult to manipulate. In a laboratory. Because it's so large that. It is not really. Amenable to. Genetic modification. So what we do need is two smaller plasmids possibly. To separate out the two functions. On the one hand. We will need the borders the selectable markers part regulation signals and the cloning side and an OP. But we need. As well. An Origin of replication and we do need the very genes. These many genes A B. C.. Through to gene that. Code for the proteins that allow us to transform. Plant cells. So what we can do is maybe split up these two functions. So the variance genes. On one plasmid. On the other large plasmid with bacterial selectable Marca. So we know that plasma is in there. And an origin of replication. And separate that out. From all the other functions. Where we put our cloning side. Our plan selectable Maka between the border. And this is the place where we're going to put our favorite gene. And we need another. Selectable Marca. So we know. Not only this class made this. In our bacterium. But also this one and an origin of replication. So what we've done we've taken the T.-I plasmid. And we've chopped it up into two separate units. One. Which is going to give us all the functions. For the transfer of the teeth in a way to the plant cell. So we put these into different bacteria. Agro bacterium initially. Carrying very. And that can sit there ready for accepting this plasma. And initially this. Plasmid can be any Caroline. Which allows us to use all the modern. Molecular techniques that allow us to modify the the. The plasmid. To our particular liking. So in the cold light then we do the. Modification we insert. Our favorite gene. Here your favorite gene shown in yellow. Is in. IT INTO IT UP cloning side between the borders. And we have all these other components. And we combine them then. Into agro bacteria. By transforming that plasmid. Into. Agro bacterium either by mating it or. By Lecter peroration. This allows both plasmids. To be located in one. Agro bacterium cell. And then what happens next where we grow up the agro bacterium to face. We culture it. With wounded plant cells this can be done by cutting. Surfaces. This can be all sorts of explants. And that's dealt with in a mobile lecture. And then we. Culture. The wounded plant cells together with Aqua bacterium. And then we select transgenic. Transform cells in. Tissue culture. Culturing together. Wounded cells. Plant cells. With. Go back to containing. Our modified. T.-I plasmid. Those cells. Individual cells can be then transformed. They can be cultured to form callus and those calluses. Can be then induced to regenerate on selective medium. Because we have a selectable mark of a plants in there. So they're grown on medium. Containing an agent. That will only allow cells. To to divide. That actually contain. Not only our favorite gene but the selectable marketing. And those plants. And hopefully then. Be regenerated. To. Whole plants which. Then root and grow in soil. And now. Only have received this. Single stretch. Of D.N.A. between the two borders. That contains our favorite gene. And the selectable marker that we've used to select out the. Transforms. I'll leave you with a few conclusions. Natural G.M.O. Yes we can use that to make our own G.M. mouse. Agro bacterium. Has been transforming plants for millions of years. And transfer more. Transformation is a very precise way of introducing single. New genes. Into plants. As with every human endeavor. There are always risks. And we're going to that. In another lecture. But that is always something to take seriously in this sort of research.",

                "text": "Well as a Christian bomb. And I'm going to tell you today. About natural genetic engineers. And the evolution of a very close interaction between bacteria. And plants. Now it's been known for a long time. That bacteria cause diseases. Is a specific disease. In many plants which causes. Crown goals. And root goals. Particular on trees but on many other plant systems. And this disease is. Induced by a bacterium called agro bacterium tumour facia ants or bacterium is a gram negative. Rod Sheard saw a bacterium which lives free. In the soil. And in association with plants and it's closely related. The Karoli and. Other bacteria. Such as riser bam it contains like all bacteria nuclear envelope free. Circular large chromosome. But it also contains a large. Independently replicating plasmid Agra bacterium. Will associate. To plant. With plant. Especially with wounded. Tissues in plants. And there it will use its. Plasma D.N.A.. To modify genetically modify its host. Now the center of this system is the T.-I plasmid which is the engine. Of transformation. I'll show you on the board. The T.-I plasma display it. Into basically. Two regions. We have the T D N A which is bounded by these borders. Left and Right. And it is this section of the plasmid. That is transferred into the plant. And their genes. Coding for office in by synthesis and site in cytokine and by census. Actually produce. Hormones plant hormones which cause. This callous growth these goals to be produced on the plant. But specifically. There is another set of genes which are responsible for synthesizing a class of a minor acid like compounds called. Opioids. So this region. Is transferred into the plant. Whereas the rest of the region. Codes for variance genes. And the open catabolism genes those of the genes that enable the bacterium. To degrade the O.P.'s. And use them as a source for carbon and nitrogen. The opiates come in many flavors. We have talked to pain no plain mammoth pain. Agro pain. As typical opiates. And you can see that they all contain this group and they generally contain CA BOXALL groups which make them similar. In a way to my no assets. These compounds exclusively. Are produced by the opium synthesis genes so plants do not naturally produce these products neither do out of the bacteria and agro bacterium having the catabolism genes are the only bacteria. In principle that can utilize these as a carbon and nitrogen source. Basically as food. So what happens when. Agro bacterium. Associates itself. With a plant cell. A plant cell. Which is wounded in particular where wounded plant cells produce these flab annoyed compounds which act the signals. The signals are sent by a. Gene by a receptor on the surface of Agra bacterium. Called V. or a a very gene encoded by this. Or prawn a variance genes. This is a protein which were forced for a late. Second Vera Lance gene called very G.. When Mathis phosphor later than. Activated. The other via genes are expressed. As part of this process the T D N A which I described earlier which is bounded by these borders. Is cut on a single stranded level. And a single stranded piece of D.N.A.. Corresponding to this D.N.A. the T.D.M.A.. Is excised from the plasmid. Fire rolling circle mechanism. And another very gene called viddy to. Associates with the front of this. T.D. and I and guides that. Through the pores. Which are produced by other very genes. That link. The bacterial cell to the plant cell. As Verity. Passes through. Other proteins. Such as these very eat. Proteins. Bind. The single strand a piece of D.N.A. and protect it from degradation of the host plant. Verdi to. Also has a new clear targeting signal that directs this protein. Together with it. Are in a card with D.N.A. cargo. Into the new class. Where it is then. Inserted into the plant genome. Thereby producing a transgenic plant which has these new genes in it for. Opium synthesis. And also genes that make. Hormones which will induce this crown goal. Structure in which and around which. Agro bacterium can then live. And basically. Get supplied with an environment and food. Where they can replicate. So I'd like to draw some conclusions for you here. I go back to ram is basically. Producing natural. Genetically Modified Organisms are bacteria has been genetically. Has been genetically engineering plants. Probably for millions of years. Transformation. Is a very precise way of. Achieving a selective advantage for the bacterium. To grow. Where other bacteria cannot grow.",

                "text": "Well my name's Chris embalm and I'm going to talk to you about. Post transcription of Gene silencing. Or the regulation of genes. After they've been transcribed. Now basic. Transcription all. Regulation of genes. Is done by promoters. Promoters are actually molecular switches at the front of genes which allow. Genes to be switched either on or off. They can regulate. Where and when a gene. Is transcribed or switched on. And they also control the level of transcription. So you can have strong promoters. And you have weak promoters. However. Switching off genes. Can be a rather slow process. By switching off a gene. There can still be lots of messenger R.N.A.. Around in the cell which can still be translated. So for example switching off a tap on a bath doesn't mean the bath is empty. So there are a lot of other levels of regulation. Of gene expression and. Apart from transcription. Obviously promote. Proteins can be modified. And affect their activity. Parts of the genome can be. Actually opened up or closed up to either. Allow transcription of genes or. Stop the transcription of genes. But there are gradations of messenger R.N.A.. Can Help. Switch off genes or indeed. Never let them come through expression. And this process is called P T G S or post transcription of Gene silencing. Now how is this process discovered. Well I'm going to tell you about the. Antisense story. And this started in the late ninety's. When scientists from both America and Netherlands. Started to look at trying to modify. Plans to make them give them an enhanced flower color. So they introduced the gene. And enzyme. Which makes a pigment and the sign in and that. Gene is called Shall can synthesize. And they introduce this into Petunia plants. In order to make dark a flower color. And what they found was that in some cases. They got white flowers. Which was very odd because they expected to get a deeper. Purple color. And in the picture you see some of the examples of such a change to a lighter flower color. When they analyzed what had happened in the genome. They found out that there were lots of insertions. Of the gene which they expected. But some of these. Insertions. Were actually. Head to tail or. Tell to tail. Inverted repeats. And these tandem repeats. Of course. Then. If they're transcribed from one end with a strong promoter. Can produce a sense. And what they call an anti sense message which is the reverse and complement of the actual transcript. And initially they thought that this. Antisense. R.N.A. would hybridized with the messenger R.N.A. and. Stop that messenger R.N.A. from being transcribed it. However the situation was more complicated. The antisense hypothesis turned out to be wrong. Inverted repeats. Can actually form. Have pin loops. Because of the complementary nature. Of nuclear casts its which can then hybridized together to form a stem loop structure or have pin loop. And these happen in loops are recruited by a natural system. Are in a degree Dacian that's what I'll talk to you about now. Double stranded on a species are recognised by a little enzyme. Called dye stuff shown here in purple dye so it will chop up. These double stranded R.N.A. is into small. Twenty nucleotide. Double stranded on AIDS. Which then. Separate out. These are an ace. Species can then be actually recognized by an R.N.A. dependent. R.N.A. pull in my eyes which were. Amplify their Those particular. Molecules and produce lots more of them. These single stranded short. R.N.A. species. And then recognized by a complex of proteins. These proteins. Include D.N.A. binding proteins and also and the nuclear is shown here in pink. On the picture. Now once this. Risk complex that's called. Binds these small R.N.A.'s they then can recruit. The messenger R.N.A. to which they are complementary. And the endo new creates then. Splits. The messenger R.N.A. making it. Unable to be translated. Of the Y. but Sam. And then further degraded by natural. On a degradation mechanism. This is a complex and very interesting process that nobody knew about some years ago P.T.A.'s probably have all the. As a mechanism against. Diseases such as retrovirus doubleton on a viruses P.T.'s also then evolved further. We call it our an ally for short. To regulate indulge in US genes. So there are many of these small R.N.A.. Coding genes. In the genome. Of micro R.N.A.'s they're called. Which actually. Regulate in dodginess genes involved in developmental pathways such as juvenility. And flowering these micro R.N.A.'s can also be transported from cell to cell so. When you have a micro and a produced in one cell these can be transported from cell to cell throughout the organism. So we get a systemic effect of. Gene silencing. Throughout the whole plant. Thank you clues than. I'd like to say that leave you with a message of promoters are not the only regulators of gene expression. Are An AI is furthermore very useful for scientists because it enables us to knock out specific genes. In a highly Gene specific manner. Furthermore. By technologists could make use of R.N.A.. I as a way to silence genes that. Code for traits which they maybe don't want. Are an AI. Relies on a complicated and dodginess mechanism. And is not just a simple physical chemical effect on a degree day ssion is a potent target for gene regulation. In plants animals and. All levels of biological systems.",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this clip on. The F. test for food and reduce models. Let me show you on a map where we are. So in earlier clips we looked at you know her table ready. Found an F. test over there. And we looked at some so squares of individual. Regresses and now we switch to another topic related some to switch the F. test for food and reduce models. I would like to introduce another example now this is an example about cholesterol levels in humans and we look at data from a study under a relation between cholesterol levels and. Fish fish consumption. We have a study of. Five hundred individuals. And we have five parables available. The response from all the why is the cholesterol ratio which is actually the total cholesterol level defined it by the good part of. Cholesterol the H.D.L. part. This. Yields. And fell use of. One and larger. Small values. Being better cholesterol levels. We have. Poor aggressors here we have the age of a person who wastes to see a complete events the heart rate and. The fish consumption. We fit a multiple injury question models with these four aggressors. Using least with us. If we fit such a model to reseal will be. And I know for tribal and we get the least ques estimates. To the repression questions as you know. But first you know for terrible. Here we have to see. Which is the estimate of the research will the Araf Ariens. And we have the last test here. A test that is the case for put a hyphen to be value point zero three one. This is the. F. test. Also called the. F. test for testing. All the coefficients. Simultaneously. In this case we test here whether it be the one be to two B. to C. B. to for might all be zero. That no hypothesis is rejected because this. Be value is. Much lot smaller than five percent. Police Quest and it's a shown here. And connected to each individual coefficient we have a T. test. For the individual coefficients here for B. to one B. to B. to three beautiful. And we see for instance that. No hypothesis to be the one is zero is rejected. For me to two it is rejected. For three and four they are not reject. Please note here by the way that for this data set we have a very small ask where it is equal to one minus this ratio is point zero three two only a little bit more to three percent of total fairy ation as it's explained by this regression model. So we know how to handle the situation of. All coefficients. We know how to handle the situation of an individual coefficient. But what if we were interested in subset of corporations. For instance we could be interested in all the non dietary represses in our example. So we age. Waste and heart rate. Together. So maybe we would like to test this no hypothesis bitter one needed to be to three. All equal to zero. And we go on to use the extra sum of squares principle meaning that we go to compare a full model. And then reduce model. By there as in values. Ever since the square us food model. Is the model. That will already stated. All requests are in. We have a no hypothesis with a B. They want to be there to be the three are all equal to zero and that brings us to the reduced model. Well fairly what we know from the. No hypothesis fill in the value zero. And in the end we find every Jews model. Equal to be the zero possibly to four times X. for. Which is just a simple in the regression model. Containing only. If this consumption. The full model. Will give us an ever so most ques the reduced. Model will give us give us an ever so much squares and we going to compare the. Now the question for you which of the two is larger the ever so much question the food model or the reduced model. And why. Stop the clip for a moment think about it and return. OK. Hello again so here's the answer. Well the. Ever so much quicker to reduce model is larger. Because the reduced ball is a special case of the full model. Family for the case that those. For the Beatles are equal to zero. So it's a smaller model it will fit with us than the full model. So it will lead to a larger sum of squares of error. So the S.S.E. to reduce model will be larger than the S.S.E. of the full model. Let's construct Now the S. does that to stick from the east to. Ever some so squares. So here is the definition of the. F. statistic and let's go through the components of it. So here we have. The difference between the error sums to square it up to reduce enough to fool models. So we might call this the extra somewhat squares. Four X. one X. two X. three. After X. four. Here we have the decrease of freedom connected to it. This is actually the difference in ever decreasing freedom of the reduced model. In our example and minus two and a full model and minus five. So actually this equals the number of parameters. Taken out from the full model. Three here. You could call this the extra degrees of freedom if you like it with an extra so much squares an extra degrees of freedom. And we defied by. The embassy from the full model which is the estimate of dead affair instead. We have. So let's apply this for the example. So we will test the no hypothesis. For these three known dietary. Requests. We fit a full model. And the reduced model. And we get ever some so squares for the fool ever some squares of the reduced model. And also the degrees of freedom for these two models. And we construct the F. statistic. It's way. He says the extra sum of squares. He says the extra degrees of freedom. Defined by the embassy it will yield five point two three. If the no hypothesis is true then. This F. that is it would behave like a random draw from an F three four hundred ninety five distribution here. It is pictured. And the outcome is quite far in the right tail of this distribution the P. value is point zero zero one five. So we're going to reject in the hypothesis. We conclude that. H.. Waste and or heart of eight. Are related to cholesterol ratio. This P. value for this after this could be obtained directly if we used to know for function in our once again. We just plug in the spin and the results from the whole model as a reduced model and I will calculate the Esther to stick. One point two three and a peaceful you directly. A few remarks now. So did. This S. the to stick. We could write it down in the following way it's an extra someone squares the fighter by extra degrees of freedom defy the body. And this you give the full model. We could also formulate it using requestion some so squares. Instead of. Ever some so squares. So the F. would be the difference in Re question some more squares. Between fool and reduced models. And if I did by difference in repression decrease of freedom. The real book would be decide. If this ever ratio is close to one. This ratio is close to one. It means that this. Extra so must Christie followed by X. or degrees of freedom. Is close to the. M.S.E.E. from the full model that we have. So not only is the M.S.E.E.. From the full of then an estimate of the sequence for epsilon. But also this. Ratio of extra somewhat squares over absolute research freedom is an estimate of the of the ever fairy and in that case by going from the reduce model to the full model only noise is introduced. And then the hypothesis will not be rejected. The F. test that we have seen so far are just special cases. Of this FS for fuel and reduce model for the omnibus F. test and you know for terrible. Works like this we start with a full model. We have the know hypothesis and it brings us. The reduced model. And the F.. Test from you know for trouble is just an application. Of the year in the S. It is the we've just define. If you look at the. Two sided. T. test for individual coefficients that we see that we obtained from the. Least ques estimates. Actually these are equivalent. With an S. best. For a full and reduced model again. For instance. Let's focus on B. to forget fear factor. This consumption. So we start with the full model. All the requests in the model. We have. Are no hypothesis that says that B. to four is zero it brings us the reduced model. So this be to four X. four drops out. And if we applied that. So we already had a full model here is to reduce model four to six last example and with the an over function we get the ESTA to stick. So here's the. S. the to stick for it. And the P. value. And if we would use the. The T. test for the individual coefficients. We can see that those B. Those are exactly the same. And actually. After statistic here is just the square of that. T. for you so it's all the tests that we've seen so far can be looked upon as. After us for food and reduced models. In summary. Testing linear hypotheses about subsets of parameters. Is performed by comparing the full model. And the reduced model the reduced model is obtained by incorporating the values of the of the. Beat us as specified under the law our purposes. Into the full model. And therefore the reduced Will is a special case of the full model. The reduced model is nested within the full model. The full model and reducible are compared by the extra summer squares. Which is the difference between ever simple squares of. Reduced for models. And it tells how much better. The full model fits. Compared to the reduced model. That's the to stick. Down is obtained by taking a ratio. In the numerator we find this extra somewhat squares the fighter by extra liquid to feed him. In the denominator we have the embassy from the full model. And under the no hypothesis at this S. that is because an F. distribution. With degrees of freedom. Shown here. The army was after us from you know for tribal. And the F. test for individual beat the Jets which are in quick fluent. Two sided key tests on your special cases. Of the procedure. Which was just described. OK thanks for your attention and see your next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this clip. On the simplest ways we visited. Let me show you on a map where we are. So we looked at. You know her table in the F. test and there we encountered some squares already and now we continue with some squares. Example that we look at. Again is are the weight loss data. Where we look at the relationship between why the weight loss of some chemical compound and. To regress is X. one. Exposure time. And X. to the relative humidity. A multiple in your regression model is fitted use at least squares. Now recall the I know for table. For the weight of example so this is the table we've seen before. Nicely in the center we have T. as s e the air assume a square is which is the results from the least place is the motion. And the bottom we have to S.S.T. the total sum of squares around the mean. Which is also an ever so much squares. But for the no model. Containing only the intercept and we have T. S. S. are the regression somewhat squares which is the difference as a team minus as a Z. and its that part of the total sum of squares which is captured by the regression model. For completeness here. Are a few formulae but I skip them now. Let's focus on this revision someone's Quest is our it tells us which part of the total sum of squares is explained by the multiple regression model. So by X. one and X. two together. But what are the contributions of the individual requests as now. Can we split S. R. into components for X. one and X. two separately. And the answer is yes we can but generally in different ways. And the main idea here is that we add a recursive to the model. And then we calculate in the decrease of the as a Z.. Now let's do the here. And by the way. And a decrease in SE is the same as an increase of. As are so let's. Fit a sequence of models here for the example data that we have and that's right down the S.S.. So we start with the intercept. Only model only beat a zero here. Every a profession is predicted pretty mean actually. And the reason you're so much square is thirty two point four seven which is actually S.S.T.. We actually want to model which is the exposure time. And we fit the model and we write down the AS HIS you once again it's now six point four seven. And if we take the difference of the two. We find twenty six point zero zero which is the sum of squares of. X. one after the intercept. And third let's add. X. to humanity. To the model. And let's write down the receipt you will ever so much squares three point four three. And the difference with the earlier model is three point zero four. So with X. two. Another three point zero four can be explained. We see here by the way did you contribution of X. one after the intercept is much higher than that of. X. two. So X. one seems to be more important. Also note that if we take the sum of these two sums of squares twenty six and three point zero four we nicely get twenty nine point zero four which is the real question some whiskey. Squares that we already saw and you know for table. We see a nice split up here. This is the color the sums of squares that we calculated are called sequential some so squares there are some squares of individual regresses in one specific order. Of sequence and here the order was started with intercept decks one X. two. Sometimes the same squares are called tie one some squares or incremental sums of squares and with the ARE function I know far we produces these. Sequential some squares. And here they are. Now the question is what will happen if we. Change the order of the requests. Will those sumptuous Quest remain the same. Well let's do it. We changed the order we started with the intercept. Then we had X. two. Then we had X. one. So once again here is the. Intercept only model. We had X. two. And we see here. An ever so much squares of twenty eight point five four. A difference is three point nine three. And we add X. one to model. Exposure time and then we arrive at three point four three is the ever so much squares. And we find a sum of squares of. X. one after X. two equal to twenty five point eleven. And you know what function we have given these sums of squares directly. Please note that the simplest question another same as what we saw before. Really we found three point zero four Now this three point nine three and four X. one earlier it was twenty six now it is twenty five point eleven so we must conclude that the effect of humidity for instance on a weight loss. Is different from models including or excluding exposure time. My first. Now typically. You would like to know what the contribution of her aggressor is. After correction for all other requests. So what we would like to calculate is the difference in ever so much quiz of the full model work. All the requests are included in the model without that specific requests or. In other words. We would like to know what your status of the dropping of requests are from the food model. These sums of squares are called. Partial sums of squares or. Type to some so squares and. They represent a difference in every sense of squares from a full model by dropping an individual term and. The model comparisons that you make. Are shown here. So for ex one it's. The comparison of the full model. And then you leave. X. one from the model. And you check how the. Everson was press changes. The function drub one of our. Will give you these partial sums of squares. These partial sums of squares generally do not add up to the repression so much squares if you tried here we find. Twenty nine point zero four. Which is not the same as the ISS Are we found in the. You know five ten. Partial sums of squares are not order dependent. Unlike the sequence will some squares. That we saw earlier. So the reason now for that the sum so squares for the individual represses become all independent is. Correlation among the requests if we calculate the correlation between exposure time and humanity we find a mild and negative correlation minus point zero five. If the correlation would have been zero. Then the sequential since the squares would be unique and. Equal to the partial sums of squares. And in that case we can quantify the contribution of requests or to the explanation of why. Because of X. two being in a model or not and in experimental studies. The research you can. Defies and cover that in correlated with resists him or herself. Which is advantageous but in a professional studies this is usually not possible. We Christians will be correlated as some squares of individual represses will not be unique. Here's another. Rather extreme example about planned damage. So we. The response wise. Plan they're much measured in some way. And we look at their relationship with the ammonia concentration in the air. It's one. And the ozone concentration in the air here you see scatterplots. And we clearly see fairly strong positive relationships of these two reverses with the response. And let's calculate the error sum of squares for a series of model here is the intercept only. Ever since. Squares here is the model with only the ammonia. Used as a regress or his only ozone and here they are combined. And here we have all the ever simpler squares. And I have two questions for you. So give the sequences some of squares for the order intercept at X. one at X. two. But also give the partial sums of squares. And you will find some striking difference. And what might be the reason for that and stop the fear now. Think about it and return. If you have a satisfactory answer. I will again. So let's calculate those some squares here first the See question is somewhat squares. For four X. one after the intercept. We have to take this difference forty eight point four three. The sum of squares of X. two. After X. one. Is this difference is. Point twenty six. If we now calculate the partial somewhat squares of X. one. So we drop it from the floor model. That this is the relevant. Difference in ever some squares it is two point three seven. And compare it with. The forty eight point four three that we found here. There is a huge difference. The partial some of squares of X. two. Is this. Difference. Point twenty six. And it necessarily has to say missed the sequential summer squares of X. two here because it concerns the same double comparison. We see here really large differences between the sequence the impartial Summers quiz of X. one. And the reason for that is why you might have guessed it. The strong correlation. Which is sometimes called the collinearity among others own and ammonia. The correlation actually here is point nine hundred nine. And if we make a little scared to plot. For its own first as ammonia. You already see it. So we see here huge differences. We will return to this topic later in a later clip. When we discuss this. Collinearity problem. In summary the requests are somewhat squares as is our. Can be decomposed. Into contributions of individual requests. And given a study model. The sum of squares of an individual repressor. Is the change. Of the ever so much squares due to inclusion of his requests into this model. This. Sum of squares generally depends on the starting model. Meaning the presence or absence of other requests and starting with the intercept. Only model. And entering to regress in a specific order. One after the other. It leads to sequence by one simple square is generally. These are order dependent. Partial talked to some says where's are some squares obtained by dropping an individual requests or from the food model they're not order dependent every press is our own correlated. The sum of squares of the regressors does not depend on the presence or absence of all the regress as some squares are unique. Thanks for your attention as you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "In this video. We will have a closer look at the main gate affect us for cardiovascular diseases and. Cardiovascular disease risk management. The major base factors for C.B.D. our blood pressure. She is on cholesterol. Smoking and diabetes. In men who are fifty five years in though for would have an optimal basic fact a profile so no smoking no diabetes. No. Elevated cholesterol and normal blood pressure. Their lifetime risk of developing C.V. D.. Is much lower. It's. Three fold. Lower for she V.D. events. It's six faults lower for C.V. D. death. And for coronary heart disease which is mainly myocardial infarction it. Even though we duck ssion that's ten fold. Compared to those with two award. He wished factors. You can see that in the picture below. And the same pattern. Is seen in women. Women want to do a C.V. prevention. We have to focus on. Risk factors like diet and lifestyle. Modifiable. Risk factors. And the population based strategy. Where we have mass campaigns to change people's behavior. Where we have. Industry. Involved too to improve the quality of foods. Walking and cycling. Infrastructure and so on this very effective for. Influencing the basics of cardiovascular diseases. But of course we also need what we call the high whisk approach where we treat people with. Extremely high waist by means of medication. And also of course diet and lifestyle improvements. An important study that has been carried out recently is the perspective studies. Elaboration. It's the Midtown Ellis'. That combines data from observational studies of biological C.V. deal with factors and cost specific mortality. The aim of the study is to establish statistically a way liable estimates of the effect of. Establish weak factors on C.V.T.. Include sixty one pushed. Perspective coach studies with. Individual data on. Over nine hundred thousand people and. It's based on the total of fifty five thousand fast clear deaths. Which is really a huge amount of data. And therefore because it's such a large study. They can obtain. Reliable or. Precise. Estimates for their risk factor. C V D. Associations. What you see here is still. Relation between Blood pressure on the X. axis. And to wish. Of coronary heart disease or stroke. Mortality in different age groups. So every line. Is a different age category. And what you can see that for every age. There is a gradual increase in whisk blood pressure goes up. So the wish of. Myocardial infarctions goes up. But also to waste. Of stroke. When we talk about hypertension. We say it's. Blood pressure of one hundred forty millimeters of military or higher. Or diastolic blood pressure. Above ninety millimeters of mercury. But the interesting thing is that blood pressure not only increases the risk of Shiva the when people have hypertension. But also at levels that are below the cutoff value for hypertension. So. Also in this domain. There's an increase in C.V. risk. With blood pleasure. And that's important. When we talk about population base twenty G.'s. So we should not only treat those. Clinically diagnosed hypertension. But. We should also focus on the population that still has a normal blood pressure. For Shiva deeply ventured. Blood pressure is a strong wish factor not only for she actually but also for stroke. I think even more for stroke. Therefore she agency. The prevalence of high blood pressure. Is about thirty to forty five percent. In the general population. And you can see that in all continents. Which are shown here. And you can also she that. In both low. Middle and high income countries. So it's a prevalence of risk factor. High blood pressure is to top one cause of death. In the world. So it's. It's strongly related to C.V. but also kidney disease and. Very other various other types of diseases. Are influenced by high blood pressure. It's even more related to mortality than smoking. Physical in it. To fit. Obesity. High cholesterol. And so on. We now come to total cholesterol. It's a strong basic factor for she H.D.. So it really influences your risk of myocardial infarction. At different ages. You can see that increased risk. When cholesterol goes up. But it's not that much of risk factor for stroke. Where you can she quite flat lines. So it's important to realize that vectors for my your carny only Farbstein which is a type of civi can be different from wish vectors for stroke. Which is also a type of C.V.. There are different values for blood cholesterol. In western societies. We normally say that an optimal cholesterol. Is below five point two million miles per liter. In the USA. They talk about milligrams per deciliter So be aware that you can see. Two different types of units. In the literature. You can. You can compute. The amount of. L.D.L. in fasting blood samples. By using a well known formula. Called to fleet of old formula which is as stated over here. And you should also know that there is a type of genetic disorder. Called a familial hypercholesterolemia. Which is caused by a defect in the L.D.L. receptor and. Debt leads to. Extremely high blood levels of cholesterol. And these people. Also have a high level. Especially of C. age the. It has been shown that cholesterol. Is inversely associated with risk of cardiovascular disease. Or I should say. Corner we hardly sees non H.D.L. cholesterol which is mainly L.D.L. is directly associated with C H D. But the total. To H.D.L. way show is a better predictor for the that L.D.L. or. Age The L. alone. So therefore. Often they use this ratio in cardiovascular wish prediction models. High cholesterol is also widely distributed. Although here we see a bit more variation between continents. Like in Africa. It's about twenty percent. Whereas in Europe. It's above fifty percent of the people having a high cholesterol. And it's most prevalent in high income countries. I will now introduce to you a study that has made a. A lot of impact on what we know about cardiovascular disease as it's called the seven countries study. It was the first study that systematically investigated to. Relation between lifestyle diet. And heart attacks and strokes. In a mix of populations in these population for choosing this such a way. They are mentioned here. That you can see different lifestyles. Like the Mediterranean countries going for Italy in Greece. But also Finland where she aged the mortality was extremely high in the ninety seventies. Also Japan and Netherlands. USA and former Yugoslavia were part of the seven country study. The study was done in men. Middle aged men. And they were examined. Extensively. Between one thousand nine hundred fifty eight and ninety seventy. And they have to be followed and till now. For call specific mortality. So this is an enormous amount of information we people. Measurements. Over time. And we learned a lot about cardiovascular diseases from this specific study. The principal investigator of this study was. Former and sort. Keys and. He was really a well known scientist in ninety seven days. This is one. One quaff. Form this specific study. Here you can see the median cholesterol values in a country show this is an ecological. Type of study because the mean. Or the median cholesterol levels in the country. Are shown and. Also the ten year see age the mortality rates are shown in these countries. And what you can see is in Japan where cholesterol levels are really low. That the mortality from sheet steel was also low. But as in eastern Finland where they ate a lot of saturated fat also at a time. The weight or she had she was really high but the cholesterol levels were as well. Another import. And study. Is the flaming in heart study that started in ninety forty eight. It included. Over five thousand men and women. And it was in each eight in the small town called flaming him. In the USA. And every two years these people and the way in physical examinations and they have. Into fusion about the lifestyle. And of course. Also they did follow up. They did also. What they call the Framingham. Offspring study where they included. Children of this cold ward. And their spouses. And they did a search integration cold study of this. Cold as well. In the flame him study. Major with factors for cardiovascular disease will identify it. Like smoking that was found. Nine hundred sixty. And high cholesterol in one nine hundred sixty one. They still. All the data collected in the flaming him study. Then they did with them. To predict a ten your risk of developing C H D. In a person and. You can find all these algorithms. On their website. And you can compute your own voice as well. So the first formula. Based on the frame him study included data on. Age sex. L.D.L. H.D.L. blood pressure diabetes and smoking. But nowadays they have updated that. With them with new data and. Also with other outcomes than C.H. diesel they also did it for total C.V. the and for stroke. And for other types of. Escalate disease. And the color chart. Is just. The elk with them. Made it official way so that the doctor can see. When somebody is in the green area. He won't have to treat West. And somebodies in a wet. Area. He has to initiate medical treatments for C.V.. In Europe real so have such kind of first chord charts with different. Call us and also here we enjoy a pre estimated ten year waste of C.V. the. Mortality for an individual. And based on the Taking your risk. The absolute risk in ten years to die from C.V. D. a doctor decides whether to initiate. Pharmacological treatment or whether he in each eight other types of treatment. When it comes to treatments for the plan we prevention of she V D. When it's about five percent. You say quit smoking. Increase physical activity limit your alcohol intake. Take care of your body weight. A user healthful diet. With less than ten percent situated set. Fish. Once or twice a week. You know fetch the balls for food and a maximum intake of salt. Of six grams. Or even five claims by W. H. O. per day. When Dog is above ten percent. We also give this advice. But in addition. Pharmacological treatment is push carked. Indeed feel your learned about prevalence of major Shiva the wish factors in their effect and see if indeed you heard about wealth and studies in the fields. And you have seen a difference wage. How to make these risk score fishable. And how to in a change a treatment for the Prevention of C.V.T..",

                "text": "I will tell you something about a wisht factors for cardiovascular diseases. Can you fast killer diseases. Are a lifestyle. Disease. So poor diet and lifestyle. Are responsible for about eighty percent of the governor we hardly see these stroke. And diabetes. You can make a deviation in types of which factors for one hand we have to with factors. That comes from the outside. From the environment. Like smoking diet. Physical activity. Alcohol use. Stress and. All kind of other affect us. On the other hand. We have the biological with practice. And watch initially. Factus. These are. Age sex. Genetics. Blood blood Lippitt blood pressure. And so on be aware that see video. Risk factors not only affect the heart. In the blood vessels. But they also influence. Kidney function. Brain Health. And T. I. Because these organs are. Fool. Blood vessels. And when. Anything. Occurs in the blood vessels or confirm she will be affected as well. And all the way to divide the C.B.D. with fact this is the traditional or. Classical wish vectors. And nontraditional or. Emerging novel. With factors. I've shown a few here. On the slight. Like two additional respect us are with practice that we have known for a long time. We know that smoking high blood pressure. Dyslipidemia. Obesity. They have a first effect on. Cardiovascular disease but there are also new are things that we found in in in China to fix studies. Like. B. and P.. It's a substance that she created by them. Tissue. H.I.V. has an effect on cardiovascular disease. So like more new or. Whisk factors. And another way to make a distinction is between. Modifiable and non modifiable with factors and that's mainly important for public health. So which factors can you. Intervene a poem and which. Other factors are just fixed. So to say. And here you can see a way said Miss A teacher neg age and gender These cannot be modified. We have to deal with that. But the other factors mentioned in this life can be influenced by lifestyle. And diet. What about genetics How important are these in their C.V. deal with. Prediction. Well we have a lot of new studies coming out. About genetic factors polymorphism snips. Changes in the N.H. sequence or. Variance in D.N.A. sequence. But it's a bit disappointing. Effect when we add all these factors together. We have only a small improvement in basic prediction for cardiovascular disease. And you can see that here in the walk her off that is only a little bit off important where you get all the information that we have on. Genetics together. Interesting field of we sure cheats on early lifestyle factors. And that has to do with that the width of cardiovascular diseases in adult toot can always be influenced early in life. So even at the time of conception. Or when children are. Not yet born. Or just off the births. And epigenetics which is in fact changing the expression of G.'s. Without. El talking to genes themselves. May play an important role in this waste. So when your. D.N.A. is exposed to a certain environment. Early in life that environment. Influences which genes. Are more expressed. And which G.'s are less expressed so. Some genes may even be locked. Throughout life. Because of the environment. That you grew up. And important. Doctor who did a lot of research in this field is. David Barker. And the Barker Hypothesis States when there's fetal in the nutrition. So when there's not adequate nutrition. Early in life that. When these children are born. They may eat a lot more to grow. And that growth. May negatively impact their waist or for example diabetes or obesity. Or cardiovascular diseases. There are also determinants of. Risk factors. So which factor may be influenced by. Underlying patterns. For example. Social economic status. Is a driver. Of a healthy diet and lifestyle so which is the way you factor. Is it a diet. Or is it the social economic status. Because these often determinants. And these determinants. Are often and we flexion of the major forces to live in social economic and cultural change. So globalization. Urbanization and population. Aging. Are determinants of which factors. So in this video you have learned how to classify. Affect us. You learned about classical risk factors and knew once. The importance of the environment. Compared to genetics.

                "text": "I will now tell you something about the community of cardiovascular diseases. Of all non-communicable diseases. Most is. C.V.T. as you can see here almost forty percent of all N.C.D. death is due to cardiovascular disease. Which is more than for example. For cancer. Be aware that these kind of data. Are always based on what tell it is statistics. And it may be a little difference where you talk about. Incident disease that also includes non-fatal. Events. Here you can see a list of the major causes of mortality and of life lost worldwide. And you can see that. For mortality. Ischemic heart disease or coronary heart disease. Is the number one cause of death. And followed by stroke and. Therefore years of life lost. Also ischemic are disease and stroke. Are in the top three. So we are talking about a major public health problem here. So it's the number one cause of deaths in the world. Over fifty million people died of C.V.T.. In two thousand and twelve. And that's one third of all global death. Over seven million was due to go on every heart disease maybe myocardial infarction. And six point seven million. Was due to stroke which is c of a disease. What most people don't know. Is that more than eighty percent of Stevie D. mortality occurs in low and middle income countries. So it's not only a disease. Of Western societies. As you can see clearly in the graph below. And it's expected that in the year two thousand and thirty. Over twenty three million C V D deaths will occur in the world. Which is really a lot. In almost every continent. C.V.T. is the most frequent cause of death. Except for Africa. But it's expected that. In the year two thousand and thirty. Also Shiva D. will be the main cause of death in Africa. And dish Rice in C.V. D. in lower middle income countries. Is largely due to the progressive. Urbanization. And the the. Unhealthy lifestyles. That they adopt. So as you can see in the figure. The amount of people living in the cities. Has increased form ten percent. In one thousand nine hundred. A to fifty percent today. And it will further increase. To seventy five percent. The five countries that tests. Have the highest rate of C.V. mortality. Are Bush or the Gambia mania in Argentina. And of five countries with the lowest C.V.T. mortality flaunts Australia. Switzerland. Japan and its crown. And this has graced. Many hypothesis. So why do these countries have such a low. C.V. mortality. Is it maybe the French wine. Is in the way of living with a lot of sunshine. Is it a miniature alien diet. Or deficient take. So does kind of figure us. Wait a lot of different theories about what causes C.V.. Here you see the global pattern of C.V. mortality. And you can see that it's highly. Prevalent. Around the world. Both men and women. As I already said that. You must be aware that these kind of. Figures are based on what tell a T. statistics. The incidence of the Z's may be a little different. And whether people die from the disease is not only. Influenced by the. Instance but also by the. Care system and. The medication that's given to patients in these different countries. C.V.T. is not only a disease of men as they used to think but it's also a disease of women. As you can see clearly in the class of and you can see that in all different countries. It's only that women develop cardiovascular disease somewhat later in life than men mostly. After men a pause. But at all the. Age. More women are suffering from C.V. D.. Then men. And infect a C.V.T. is the main cause of. Of mortality. In the Netherlands in women where cancer is the main cause. In men in the Netherlands. So there is a difference between men and women. But T.V.. Is affecting both men and women. However C.V.T. in women. Has been a bit. Ignored. In the past decades. That has to do with the fact. That women develop she for the later in life. After men a pause. And quite a lot more attention is given for example to breast cancer in women that occurs. Earlier in life. Also the symptoms of safety in women differ from symptoms in men. And they present themselves. At a general practitioner. With other types of complaints. These complaints are more varied more atypical. And that makes it harder for the doctor to recognize the problem of T V D in women. What's also a bit of a problem is that. Current. Several people she has been developed on basis of trials that have mostly been done in men. Because it used to be a disease that was more thinking to men. In past years. And therefore trials were conducted to men more often than in women. But now we have to problem that medication. May not be fitting. Optimal to women. So there is a need to increase the awareness of medical doctors but also of the public. To the problem of safety in women. There has been a sharp decline E.C.V. over time. In western societies. After the second world war. So you can see that. A wound to the Second World War it was fairly high. Let's say a one thousand nine hundred seventy. It's steeply declined. In Australia. But also in other countries like USA. And here also in Finland. England. And so on. So in high income countries. She viewed the. Death has fallen by about eighty percent. What's the reason for this decline. Well the test to do with improved with effect a treatment we have better medication available at Stebbins to tweak high cholesterol levels in the blood. We have better antihypertensive to X. to tweak high blood pressure. And we have introduced. Formalistic So our P. and people enter the hospital after a myocardial infarction. Or stroke. So there's also a better. Pre-hospital and. In hospital care. They actually pull church we. And smoking cessation also is a major factor that contributed to the decline in C.V.. But we're not there yet. Still when you look at this figure. You can see that the lifetime wish for cardiovascular event. In any people living in the western society. Is still high. So there's still a lot of. More work to do. What will happen to C.V. mortality in the next year as well. In countries in transition. It will strongly. Increase. And you can see here like push eel. China India South Africa. They expect it to to sway fold increase in mortality from C V D. And these countries don't have to deal with what we call the double burden of disease problem. Some parts of the population still suffer from a nutrition. Malnutrition. Whereas some other parts. Suffer from obesity. And a high whisk of. N.C.D.C.. So in this video you of learned about the global burden of C V D. That. It occurs in both men and women and there that there are differences in awareness. And that there are trying to mention C.V.T.. In the past decades but also for the future. And achieve a storm Lee increasing in developing countries.",

A major type of cardiovascular disease is these chemical oddities. Also called. Coronary heart disease or coronary artery disease. And that again can be divided in several so. Subtypes mainly myocardial infarction and. In China pact was. Another type. Is a simple ball fest killer disease or stroke. That occurs when a blood vessel in the brain is blocked. You can have a nice chemical twelve or twelve and in the case of bleeding. In the brain because of the web of a vessel. There's also the twain she is chemically tech. That's in fact the same as in this chemical. Only disinterest last for a maximum of one or two days. There are many other forms of cardiovascular disease which I mentioned here an important one is heart failure. But also deeply missed on bosis and. And who listens. But also with me us. Major type of C.V.T.. The underlying process of cardiovascular diseases is clear Bowser's which involved a thickening of the blood vessel wall. And that. Gradually goes on until a blood clot. Is formed a plaque. And when on top of that a tour must occur. We can block. And then there's no blood flow to the tissue. So what is ethical as close as family fact is to kind of inflammatory disease. White blood cells penetrate in the walls of the arteries and. That's promoted by the bad cholesterol. The low density lipid proteins. The L.D.L.. H.D.L. which we also call the good cholesterol. Is involved in the we move for fat and cholesterol. And pointed to the liver. And therefore. H.D.L. is a protective factor in cardiovascular disease. During the as host clear what protests. Plaque. Builds up in the arteries and player consists of many materials fatties shift stances. Waste product. Calcium. And so on. The first step in plaque formation. Is damage of the end of Feeley. And the end of feeling a mistake. In the lining of the blood vessel. And damage may occur. When the blood cholesterol is too high. When there's high triglycerides. Or low H.D.L. cholesterol in the blood and. This Together we call dyslipidemia. So it's a disorder of the lip it's. In the Blood. They are too low or too high and that may cause damage to the in the psyllium also high blood pressure is a major factor in damaging the end and of course we all know. The waste factor of twenty smoking. Which may cause damage because of where the call formation. When a piece of a plaque breaks off or when a blood clot. A thorn bush is formed on top of the plaque. Then there is blocking off an archway and. Depending on the place where it occurs. It may cause a myocardial infarction. A stroke or some other clinical event like deep feelings thong bosis or even. Pulmonary embolism when the soma start traveling through the blood. C.V.T. may be divided. In supplement call and. Clinical C.V.T.. When we have large though influencing see video. Risk factors that may lead to stop clinical disease. Meaning that the disease is not clearly feasible at the outside. These dissin force all types of sclerotic process is in the body. E.K.G. abnormalities. And of course what I've just mentioned also did in the silly old dysfunction. When an event occurs a clinical event occurs. Then there is a clear date. Which that event occurs. And we talk about a hard end point in that case. So it occurs at the specific moment in time. And then often. People are admitted to hospital. So you now know about different types of cardiovascular disease. The process of ethically Welshness. And the difference between subclinical and clinical C.V.T..",

We do investigate the behavior of microorganisms in food. And the behavior of microorganisms in food. You could say. Has three dimensions. We have to good the bad. And the ugly. The good ones. Are microorganisms that are used for the fermentation of foods and. By fermentation we can increase the taste of food products. We can make them better digestible Or sometimes. Improve their health aspects. But on the other side you also have to bad. Microorganisms organisms that can result in intoxications or in food infections. And that of course. We want to prevent. And the third thing. The third type. Are the only microorganisms the ones that do spoil of foods that don't directly have a public health impact. However they are important for economy. They are important for sustainability and especially in regions for food security is also important they are really important for life. So we do investigate. The behavior of these microorganisms in all kinds of different aspects. We look at them from. You could say genotype to control. We do investigate these microorganisms in oakland of different aspects. We look at their growth behavior we look on the microscope. We look at. If they can grow on several substrate. We look how they are in active feted with certain stresses for us. For instance after cleaning or after heating and. If we see their characteristics. We try to relate that to their genomes to the specific genes that I do have. And if we are able to do so we can also based on the genome. Tried to predict what the. Phenotypic.

                "text": "In order to preserve foods we often make use of heat and activation like bastardisation or sterilization processes. Or just simply cooking. Of a food product. And if he did an activation processes are often. Occurring at different temperatures the temperatures do differ in different locations in the food product but also. They are heating up or. Cooling down so in time. Also the temperature. Can differ. And in many cases if you have food produced at different processing lines or different processes. Different temperature and time combinations can be used. And it could be that one. Factory is friends of producing food at and best rising at seventy degrees during. Thirty seconds and another manufacturer is processing at seventy two degrees during fifteen seconds. If we want to compare these two different processes. We want to compare an equivalent number. And for that. We need to have some sort of currency that we can define in order to compare different processes just as if we would have dollars. And if we would have a rose. In order to compare these two we need to have some comparison. And to have some reference and. That is where it is like there will be about. So if we would have a process which consist of a step of. One minute at fifty five degrees and then one minute at sixty degrees. And then. One minute at sixty five degrees. That is a dynamic process the temperature is changing. And what we want to determine. Is what would now be the same process at that where the temperature is all the time sixty five degrees. That give the same equivalent reduction. So we take as. Equivalence as a comparison. That Bind. It's equivalent times. At sixty five degrees. So we have four. Profile and. We can determine the look reduction. Of all the sequence whole steps and. The step at fifty five degrees during. One minute at fifty five degrees. Gives as a look reduction. Key. Defied by to devalue. The same at sixty degrees and the same at sixty five degrees so the overall reduction that we achieve is the sum of the reduction of these three different processes. We want to recalculate it to an equivalence time. At sixty five degrees and the local reduction. During a certain time at sixty five degrees is the time divided by the. The value at sixty five degrees. So we can combine these two week way chanson calculates that. Equivalence time. By multiplying this the sixty five with all the terms in this equation and then we get here or equation. D. sixty five. Of the private or first term the sixty five multiplied by the second term. And the sixty five multiplied by the third and we can see that there are equivalent time. Is the ratio between the value. At the reference temperature divided by to process temperature of fifty five. To devalue or sixty five divided by the devalue at the second step at sixty degrees and the devalued. At sixty five divided by the. Devalue at the third stage who had a temperature over sixty five degrees. And after a time multiplied by the time of that process temperature. That is secretly carried out. So the equivalence heating time. This. Equivalent heating time that we have now defined at sixty five degrees. Is ALSO terms that. Integral lethal effect. So that F. L. U.. And that this or equivalent number. Which we can use to compare all kind of different processes. So in order to make this calculate. We introduce a new term which is to Little rate. And the little rate is the relative defacing rate at a certain temperature. We have seen that in this equation that every time we have here. This. Three terms. The devalue at the reference temperature defied by the devalued. At the specific process temperature so. This term. The D at the reference temperature divided by the D. at a certain. Processing temperature that is what we call the lethal rate. The lethal rate is. As a reference temperature. Defied by the D.. At the certain temperature. Until you can see an example. In a table where we have to reference temperature sixty five degrees. And the devalued out that. Temperature will be point twelve minutes for this specific microorganism. If we go down and temperature for instance to sixty degrees. We got a factor than higher. Decimal reduction time it takes longer to enact the fate of microorganisms and. If we go even five degrees lower. It takes even longer and it takes again a factor of ten longer to inactivate the microorganisms. So this is the effect on the devalue but now if we calculate the lethal rate. The lethal rate. At sixty five degrees is point twelve. Divided by point twelve so that's one. But the little rate at sixty degrees is point twelve defied by one point two. And that's point one. And the little rate at fifty five degrees. Is point to Wealth Divide by twelfth and that is zero point zero one. So a lethal rate is how much. In a cafe Sion speed goes down with a decrease in the temperature. So we have now calculated a little rate at least three different temperatures and we can make use of. This little rate. In or equivalent time equation. So we have or equivalent time equation that we have seen before. And instead of these three. Ratios of the values we have now or create little rates at these three different temperatures. Lead to rate at sixty five degrees that is or. Reference temperature is of course one of the little rate at sixty degrees was point one. And the legal rate at fifty five degrees was point zero one. All the three process. Durations were one minute. For the equivalent time of a procession zero equals zero point zero one. Plus point one plus one. And that is one point and eleven minutes. So the equivalent time. Of this process at fifty five sixty and sixty five degrees. The equivalent time at sixty five degrees is one point one one minute or so or sequence of protest skiffs and heat in fact the facia of the microorganisms. Which is equivalent to a process that is all the time at sixty five degrees of one point one one minutes. So we can interpret a number also wanted data for LEAVE IT can see that. Heating one minute at fifty five. One minute at sixty and one minute at sixty five degrees. Gives only slightly higher. Reduction. Only one point one one minutes. Income. At sixty five degrees. And the main effect. In this number of one point one one is of course this last term. The heating. Of one minute at sixty five degrees. Is contributing. Ninety percent of the total. Integrated effect that we have with our process. So the F. L. U. is an equivalent heating time. At a certain reference temperature. But we should realize that we have done we have made this calculation now for with three discrete temperature steps. But in many real process of course we have a continuously changing temperature due to heating and a continuous changing. Temperature due to cooling. And in those cases. We have to integrate. This little rates over. A lot of different small. Temperature and. Time steps. So. Over a lot of different. Beim steps. Because the little rates. Depending on temperature and. Integrates we add up all these achievements that we have and all these different. Time steps. So we could do that for instance forest illustration process where. I plotted here the increase in temperature. During the heating. There is holding here where we keep the temperature at zero nine twenty degrees and then we do cooling again. If we want to calculate the integrated legal effect of this process. We first. The fight is in all kinds of. Small steps. And I took one minute time steps now. And we can see down the effect of the increase in temperature of the holding and the. Decrease in temperature. And all we can calculate. What a lethal rate will be in such a process and for that we can make use of the Bigelow model. Because for every damn pitcher we can calculate a little rate. By filling in the. Bigelow model. Or lethal rate equation. So we filled it in for D N N N twenty one for the team. We got exactly the same equation. The only difference is that. Here we fill in one hundred and twenty one. And here we keep the temperature. This is a thousand and twenty one and this is at the specific temperature where we are interested in. If we have this equation. We can simplify it because we can see that and both cases we have to dereference. We can strive that out. And then we get this equation. And this can even be more simplified. To this equation. So we can see that the legal rate is only depending on the set fell you off your microorganism on the reference temperature. And the temperature where we want to know a leetle rate. So this equation we can now make use of. In order to calculate or. Integrated little effect of the process where we first half. Eat things. Folding. And then cooling. In the beginning. At very low temperature of twenty five degrees sixty eighty degrees and so on the book they are all spores are not an activated at all so the legal rate sort of blue. Is zero. There is no legal rate. At a certain moment the temperatures are getting in the neighborhood of hundreds on a ten hundred twenty. And then of course the spores are an act of faith so then we see the late the rate govern up. At holding the legal rates remains constant. And then after we are cooling the little rate is going down again. So we see. Exponentially increasing legal rates with and then only increasing temperature. So this is how fast the microorganisms. Are in activating birds were we interested in this. That additive affects all the steps that we have achieved. We are going to add up to see how much in activation and total we have achieved. So we first have a little bit of an act of faith that the next step there is again. A little rate. And then we add salt we had already had with what we have in this new in this stage and then we got to this bar. Then. What we have fear we add again to what we achieve in this stage. And so on and we don't get the integrated little effect. The addition of all these little rate. And that is this black. Curve. That we have here. I didn't hear still there is a large increase of. Integrated legal effect as soon as you are going to cool down. We don't get big. Achievements anymore of an active facia and we do not get any. Increase any more of the integrated. Lethal effect. So we have a dynamic temperature profile. We. That result in a certain legal rate. And that's results in a certain integrated. Effect or for heating process. And if we make the calculation. We get here finally to a value of three point nine one and that is DE VOS The objective of our calculation. Was to determine what is my integrated lethal effect. And the integrated legal effect of this. Temperature profile. Is that we have an equivalence. Heating. Achievements as. If the process would be. Have been carried out during three point nine one minute at a hundred and twenty one degrees so. On a twenty one the reste constant temperature and you're in three point nine one minutes. So what was now the objective of this calculation. We should remember that for about a line of coke. If we want to have a twelve lock reduction of clustered in both the line and we need to twelve times point two minutes is two point four minutes heating. At ten and twenty one degrees. But with this car collation that we have carried out here. We have calculated that this process is equivalent to three point nine one minute Saturn and twenty one degrees. So we have a process which is given three point nine minutes at two twenty one and twenty one degrees or. Object of us two point four minutes at one hundred twenty one degrees so. The conclusion is this process is adequate. It's. We have a longer heating. Than what was needed to have a boat a line of coke. So the product is safe. However we have to realize that. For Order microorganisms like Francis clustered inspiration as which has at the value at ten and twenty one degrees of. One point five minutes. This is a spoiling organism so maybe sixty would be sufficient. So we need to have nine minutes. Processing and. We have only three point nine minutes. Processing so. For maybe four Despoina. This is not sufficient for. But for the bullet I don't cook. It is sufficient. So that is the objective of these calculations it's to calculate an integrated little effect. It's dynamic. Temperature changes. So we have food industry. All kind of difference. F.L. use that are used in practice. And here you can see a table. Of commonly used F.-L. use for different type of food products. And there are differences because we have for instance to us projects. There are often we have an F L U. Between two to four because this is quite an acidic product. Also this product is quite acidic so it will have a rather rather low F L you. If you have a little bit more the intermediate ph product so more and than a neighborhood of neutral ph is like a piece of beans. They have after all use between four to six. To get to good quality and would say for the of the food products. But there are also products like for instance meat. And Grey feet. And for these type of products because fats protects. Microorganisms and. Their resistance to heat treatments. We need to have generally. Much higher. F.L. you so therefore you can see in a table that for meats and great feet. The F.L. use are more in the neighborhood of eight to ten. So to summarize. We have a legal rate which is a relative. And active facia rate of microorganisms it's an activation rate in comparison to what would happen at the. Reference temperature. And these lethal rates are integrated over the dynamic temperature profile. To get to the integrated lethal effect which is the F L U. And this F L You can be used to demonstrate. Equivalence. And especially to show that you have complied with the both the line of coke. And it can be helpful to calculate what integrate a little effect this. If you have dynamic temperature conditions. So temperature profile. During heating and cooling of your process. But you have to watch out also that these car collisions have to be done. At the coldest spot. And your food product because there of course. The biggest risk will be. Of a surviving. Organism.",

                "text": "To preserve foods. We often make use of heat treatments. To inactivate the microorganisms and. Decimal reduction time of a micro organism. Is largely influenced by the temperature. If we increase the temperature. The organisms. Are more quickly an active faded and the value become smaller. And in order to describe the effect of temperature on. He didn't activation. We make use of the said failure. So there are differences between the values of different microorganisms of the different temperatures. We see here. The inactivation of salmonella and. Liquid AK York. And we see that there is a difference between different. Ciro types of the organism and different strains. However there is also an important effect. Of the temperature on the. Devalue. If we look for instance at the first that someone out of the few million we see that at fifty five degrees. It takes eight minutes to inactivate the microorganisms. But at sixty degrees or if we go. Five degrees higher. It takes only point. Eight minutes. So effect at lower time. In order to inactivate the microorganisms. We see the same trend. Also for the. Order to similar types that. Here is going down by a factor of twenty here is going down by about a factor for an item in a confession so a higher temperature. Yes. A lower devalues or faster. In active facial. So we see a large. Decrease in an effect of the temperature on the devalued. And since that effect is so strong. We Plautus often analog read make way so we plots the. Logarithm of the value in look minutes. Against temperature. And then often we obtain a straight line. So there is an effect of temperature on the devalued and. Generally it can be described by a local linear. So look. Linear. Effect. And this. Effect can be described by this so called set value. The set is a measure of the temperature dependence of the heat. Resistance. And this model deceptive. Model is developed by Bigelow already in the first part of the twentieth century. So he said this that fell you is the change and temperature. That yields. One. Change change of one and the lower atom of the devalued Firth. For instance to devalue was one. Look at the values one point zero eight. If you go one step further you up. It goes. One lower so it becomes. Zero point zero eight. To say it in other words. It is the devalued becomes a factor. Than lower. So it going from. Twelve minutes to one point two minutes or the unit defacing rate goes up by a factor of ten. So instead of zero point zero eight three Look for a minute that goes to zero point eight three. Look up a minute. So does that tell you. If we increase the temperature by ones that fell you in our profession goes. Ten times as fast to devalue is ten times smaller. So to look at that graphically you see here the lower animals to devalue it for a specific organism as function of temperature and Francis' at fifty five degrees we have a D.V.R. you over one look do you value of one point zero eight and. That means that the devalue is twelve minutes. So the look at the is one point zero eight. To devalue is twelve minutes. If we go up by five degrees minus that fell you. To devalue at sixty degrees. Is one point two minutes or longer at I mishear zero point zero eight. So we go and look at the value exactly. One log down from zero point one eight. From one point zero eight to zero point zero eight order the value goes on twelve minutes to one point two minutes so a factor of ten. So that is the definition of does that fell you. The temperature increase to reduce exactly the defs look devalued by one. So that can be described also. In an equation as the owned by Bigelow. And that's just a to devalue at a certain temperature. Equals to devalue as a reference temperature. Multiplied by ten to the power. The reference temperature minus the temperature at which you want to know the an activation rate. If I did but if that fell you. So here you see that again graphically. We have four failure one point zero eight. That was twelve minutes. By increasing the temperature. Five degrees. We go to a local of zero point zero eight and one point zero eight. One point zero eight plus sixty mind minus fifty five divided by five. Then Exactly. Result and zero point zero eight. So this isn't a formal our description of the same. Example that I've just shown and numbers. So we can make use of this. By the table that I've shown you before of the so many different salmonella strains were. I blotted. Devalued. And I had to devalue and initial table but I calculated now the lower end of the devaluing the stable. So in the original table if you look back you will see that the devalued was eight minutes at fifty five the grace. And it was point zero point eight at sixty degrees. But then this table now I recall collated all the values to the lower end of the devalued so logorrhea them of eight point nine. The lower end of point eight is. Minus point one. And so while my did that also with the other. Sell you so. This table is now based on the local rhythm of these these I'll use. And then we can see with this change in temperature. How much the. Devalued the log devalued how much that changes. And in this case it changes exactly one longer and I'm going from point nine to minus point one The difference between the two is. One local value. So that means that. Going from fifty five to sixty gets exactly one look. Decrease of the devalued and that means that this had to tell us exactly five degrees. The difference between these two temperatures. For these two other. Zero types. We see a little bit different behavior for this serial type we see that. At the five degrees. Increase. We've got a one point three look decrease after the value of the log the value. And therefore the south value for this organism is about four degrees. And for this organism. We go from one point six minutes to one point one last minutes for the differences point five minutes. So it's a little bit less than one. And therefore there's that failure of this organism would be calculated to be. Nine degrees centigrade. So to get through all of them. The set for you if I could data cells is around five degrees. So we get one look at the crease in the detail you would have five degrees centigrade. Increase and the temperature. We should realize that. In this case does that tell us are calculated at only two points. In the graph of the effect of temperature on the devalued. So these values are not very accurate. Normally. Those shows are calculated to add much more data points and then you get to more accurate values and then you will see also that they are more in the neighborhood of five ft and. These are all you'll see this one most nicely five. But these ones are a little bit deviating. So the devalue of fetch the data cells is generally smaller than the devaluation Bourse. And also does that's value of fetid of cells is smaller than the sets value of spores. Spores are much more resistant. But there is also less often a fact of the temperature on their heat reduction. So to rule of thumb for spores to start to set failures are about ten degrees centigrade. And that means that they are a little bit less. Temperature dependence. In there in activation. So if you now look at or to face in equations. The local rhythm of the D. at a certain temperature is still over and above the at the knot of temperature plus one over the set fell you. Multiplied by this temperature difference. We can also write it the other way around and look at the higher temperatures look at the lower temperature minus. This value. We can look. What the effect of a temperature increase of ten degree bend the research would do. If it would. Inactivate fact the data cells and if we would enact if it sports so far fetched a date of selves the rule of thumb posts that are set to tell us five degrees so and five the reason got a factor of ten higher. Reduction. And then the grace you got a fact but then. Multiplied by five but then higher reductions are a factor hundreds. We can also see that by filling that. In and this equation. The longer in them of the temperature plus than it is the lower atom. Of D. at a certain temperature. Minus one. Over set so. Minus one over five. Multiplied by the temperature difference which is done the grease so low that I'm of D. at a temperature. Then the reason higher. Is lower and I'm of D. minus two. So we have to look more. Increase at this. Higher temperature. For spores does that tell you a standard Greece. So in that case if we fill in this equation we get lower and most people stand is lower and I'm of the at a certain temperature minus one over. Does that failure which is standard Greece. Also the temperature differences than the resoled. There is only one. Change in the log file you. So it is for the spores. The effect of temperature. On the face and rate is less than the. Ten degrees. Increase in temperature. We gets for the data cells. In fact of two. In the the value so it goes faster. For the spores it only gives one. Change and look. Devalued. So to summarise. Does that tell you is a measure. For the heat resistance. The effect of temperature on the heat resistance and a rule of thumb is that for. Thank you data cells to settle you with around five and four spores to set for you is around ten. And this adds value. Helps us to confirm the values. From a reference temperature to any other temperature where we want to know. The Decimo direction time.",

                "text": "In order to preserve foods. We have actually tree methods. Cider to keep them out. To kill them or to keep them from growing. And one way is to kill them. And in many cases we make use of heat in activation for instance and sterilize food products. Or in a cooked ham. But also in the cooking at home. Be in active hate. Microorganisms. And an important factor to look at the heat and activation is to devalue the Decimo production time. Heat in a confession to preserve foods important processes are best are efficient and sterilization and there. We have a defined high temperature. For a defined period of time with which we can activate better joints in order to improve the safety of our food or. We enact afraid to spoil it Flora. To influence the shelf life. And all these. Heat processes always have a balance between the effect of the treatments how much microorganisms do we enact the fades. And the cost of the treatments. Bodily to cost and the energy that we have to apply. But mainly in the decrease of the quality of our food products. So if we investigate. That microbial an act of faith. We can pluck slogan of the number of organisms. Against that time. And we can fairly well compare that's also bacterial growth where we also plots the local rhythm of the number of organisms. Against Time. But if we compare these two. We see that for growth. The numbers of course increase. And for an active phase in the numbers decrease. So the equations are very similar except that there is a minus sign in the. Left equation because the numbers do. Decrease in both cases. I've profiteer other than logarithm of the number of organisms and we have done here the in a professional rate on the look then scale. And also for growth. I've bought at the lower end of the number of ALL GOING TO HIM So it's a growth rates on look then skilled So in that case it's not a specific growth rate it's the growth rate. So it's very comparable. But there apart from the fact that this has a minus in the equation. There is also a difference that I put here as time unit. Hour. And here at the time unit. Minutes because growth often goes. Rather slowly. And sometimes even at low temperatures it might be even that the time scale will be days. But an active phase in generally is more in the order of minutes. So the facia rate is. In many cases also described by the devalued by the decimal reduction time. And the decimal reduction time Misty in the verse of the defacing rate an activation rate would be. Five sixths longer it implemented than the decimal reduction time as one over this value so it's one. Over five six to that is sixty five by five. That is one point two minutes. For the decimal reduction time. Or the value. Is the time required to reduce the number of cells. With one logarithm. So if we would split the lower animals the number of organisms. Against Time. And we have an active facing rate of five sixth's. Look for a minute. So every minute we have five six. Lock reduction so not a food item. Then we can see that it takes over five sixths. So one point two minutes to get through. One look reduction. After two point four minutes we get to look reduction. After a treat point six minutes we got to treat. Like reduction. So every time. One local addiction takes one point two minutes and. In order to get Four Loko reductions it's four times this one point two minutes. So that is the concept of the. Devalue. So the heat. In active facia equations can be described by the. Then lower atom or I can be described by the natural law of them that there are two ways to describe these effects. Boats. Will show a straight line. But the difference between the two is that the inactivation rate. Will be a factor of two point three difference. So it's. In for very important to define clearly. On which. Kill your working. And to define what you are in a profession constant if you are working on. Luck than skill or on natural logarithm skill. In many cases. Food Market knowledge is still work on lockdown basis. And in many cases. Engineers will work on natural logarithm basis. Because this is following a little bit reaction kinetics. But of course. Done logarithms are more easy to calculate with because of banter the sixty six said that makes it rather. Easy. So the amount of luck reductions that we can obtain. Sort of low grade him off. And at time zero minus a low grade him of and. At a certain time. Equals an act of facial rates. On looked and skill. Minus multiplied by the time. And it's also equal. By the divide at the time defied by the devalued. So in order to look at the devalued. That we can see in practice. I've got here a list of some examples of the values. To show all sort out between different microorganisms there is a huge difference in devaluation especially at the temperature woodies the values are measured. And we start with a very cycle Philip microorganism it's people who are facially So it's clear how does an organism growing on fish. In this cycle fall so really loves very low temperatures. So it grows. Around zero degrees at gross around ten degrees. An optimum at around fifteen. It stops growing above twenty degrees and even at thirty five degrees so. For instance at the body temperature. Already it is an active feted and has an active feted by a factor done after three minutes so after three minutes you have a fact that the reduction. After six minutes you have a factor of hundreds reduction. After nine minutes you have to fact the thousand through dose and so if this organism would be at thirty five degrees. After an hour. It will be for actually absent. We also have psychotherapy and. Microorganisms like for instance Playdom on us through our senses that's the main spoiler of meat. This organism is not as heat sensitive as to feeble you know. But it will be in activated at temperatures around fifty five degrees and there it has a devalued. Of about four minutes. Than me so feel like microorganisms like salmonella and stuff or the focus always will be inactivated at normal. Best recession range temperatures like sixty five degrees. And Frances. S'pore foremost like bacillus serious. And closely about the line and in order to get a decent an activation you need. Temperatures. That's. Boiling to temperature over water or even higher. And in order to inactivate lawsuit in both the line I'm which is an important food safety microorganism and canned foods. You need to heat the product at one and twenty one degrees during. Point. Two minutes. And this organism is often used to define what is called. The both a line cook and. Foods which are cancer. And that have a Ph of. Larger than four point five. So that are the low as it can foods. They should receive. Heat treatment. Sufficient to reduce the line I'm twelve looks. So this organism is making a very potent stocks in and. These food products are stored at normal room temperature so. The organism can grow produce toxin if it's presence. So we want to be sure that the organism is not present. Absolutely sure. Never existed but it's what's this map that says is that you have to reduce the level by a factor a million. And then over time by a factor a million. And so. Twelve looks. Reduction. That you could say is fortunately. Absence of the microorganisms. So how long should we don heat such a food product to obtain such a boat a line of coke. So one. Devalued. Well one. Fact that Ben reduction takes point two minutes at one hundred twenty one degrees. And if you want to have twelve the reduction so. MILLION dollars MILLION POUNDS reduction. Then we have to take twelve times at this point two minutes reduction. So and twelve times point two minutes is two point four minutes. In order to be. Even a little bit more sure. In industry one often takes than three minutes and so they even go a little bit higher to really be sure that this microorganism is sufficiently activated. Of course if we do a both a line of coke. Brother to say from go sit in both the line and but spoilage still can't occur because you can see in this table that our. Spoilage micro-organisms for this are not better genic organisms not organisms that can make Doc sense. But these organisms in certain cases have even higher. Devalues that steak. One of the most high once the bacillus to the most of us. This organism has had devalued all four to five minutes at one hundred twenty one degrees. So if we do about a line of coke of three minutes a ton and I'm twenty one degrees. You can see that this organism is not even reduced by a factor of ten. Because the time of eating is even smaller than the devalued office microorganism. However this organism has an optimum growth temperature of fifty degrees and. It will not grow at room temperature but only if the food product is stored that's very high temperature so. In many cases this organism. Might not be a problem but maybe if we put or. Then again in this song. And it really gets warm. This organism might spoil your product. So we can also look a little bit more at around the best of station temperatures and. I fear an example of salmonella an active face and act York. And here. There is a table of three different zero types and strains of salmonella. And you can see here to defend fifty five so that. These are you at fifty five degrees and. For one of the. Say what I've had eight minutes. The other one it's twenty one. And the third one it's forty two for you can see. There is a huge can be a huge difference between different strains or different zero types of the same organism. Of course if we increase the temperature that the value will become smaller than activation goes faster but here we see the same trend. That's someone I like something better. Is the most resistant organism. Of the tree. So the strain. The temperature and do have an important effect on the devalued. But also the specific. Food product characteristics can have a big effect. Here we have to same devaluation as. We have seen in the form of a table but. Here in this table we have also added that the value in the act right. So this is in the yellow. Part of the act is in the white part of the egg. And we can see the same trends that sound when I listen for the bear has the most resistance. But the devaluation the other men are much lower back York. So to an activation goes much faster in the egg whites. Down and the yellow part of the egg. There are two reasons for that. First of all. The PH is difference in the album and. The PH is. OK like so it's less pleasant environment for the organism so it's faster and active faded. But secondly in the ECK York there was a lot of fat and fats can protect the microorganisms so therefore. For those two reasons. The organism is much more resistant and. Back. YORK. So the value is largely influenced by the temperature that the value goes down. As a temperature goes up. But there are certain factors that can increase to devalue one of them. Is neutral Ph. Around. Neutral ph to devalue is highest for an organism. Low water activity increases the diesel yo protects the organism so dry conditions. High fat. Protects the microorganisms so that increases the devalued. And also if microorganisms. Are in the stationary. Face in the stationary face. They're also more resistant they have had a lot of stress and therefore they are more assistance to larger temperatures. So to summarize. The devalue the decimal reduction time. Is a convenient tool. To estimate the required. Heating time. Of a microorganism. And that in a phase in rate. Order the value is influenced by all kind of environmental factors like ph fats. Water activity and temperature.",

                "text": "You know I'm going to explain you how. Step five in intervention me thing which is about adoption and implementation. How that relates to the public health cycle. Because it's you see here in step five planning. Implementation. Looks very similar to the stage. In in a public health cycle. Which is also called implementation. However it is quite a difference between the two. Because in intervention mapping. Adoption and implementation. Is seen as something that is not medically done. People are not as a medically. Adopting your program for example a curriculum in a school. About health and school is not ultimately going to adopt this program it also uses in the correct way. So you have to plan for adoption and implementation you have to very specifically look at what are the reasons for. For example schools to use our program or not or to use the program correctly. Or not student have time to do it. So there is a lot of emphasis in intervention mapping to plan for a good. Adoption and implementation of your intervention program. Whereas in a public health cycle there is not much emphasis on that. Because the public health cycle mainly talks about the development of policies and a little bit about. Intervention programs but in a very general way. And there's not a lot of attention on. Thinking about a good. Implementation of a program. So implementation is mentioned. Because of course an intervention or a policy has to be implemented. But there to focus is more on how to monitor this implementation. Is the quality of implementation done. Well. Instead of planning it's in a very systematic and detailed way. OK So in this clip I've explained to you about implementation. In both models and. Especially about the differences between the two. Thank you.\n",

Step two of intervention mapping objects exist and how does relates to the object is in the public health cycle as you see in intervention and being. Step two is about defining. Program. Objectives. In a public health cycle. This comes back at different steps in the model so for example in setting priorities. In formulating aims and objectives. And also in constructing a logic model. We're in both approaches. The priorities and choices. So Also do you object to us are based on the findings in the needs assessments. So it's always. Evidence base. And in both approaches. It's emphasised that these objectives have to be formulated in a specific measurable way. So. Objectives always have to be smart. You have to be measurable. At the end of implementation of a policy or implementation of an intervention program. So then what are the differences. Well in the public health cycle. Objectives are often. Formulated in a general way. And that means that more general objectives. Are given to be able to develop a policy. Whereas an intervention meant being. You get this are defines in much more detail. So for example in the public health cycle an objective. Can be stated. On the level of health. There's an intervention it being the objectives are. Are always stays on the level of the. Determinants of health and even the determinants of behavior. So for example. What exactly do people need to know. After they have participated in the program. So it's very specific. On a very detailed level. And that's a big difference between the two models. And what you also see is an intervention meant being the objectives are always stated. Using behavior change. Theories. Whereas in the public health cycle that is possible. You can define the objectives based on behavior and in terms of behavior but it's not always the case. Well and then if we look at the logic model. In the public health cycle. There are a lot of words used there. And if you look at intervention mapping the births are very different bits the meaning is to a certain extent. The same. So if you start with the part on health intervention mapping. We speak about health outcomes. Whereas in the public health cycle. We speak about an overall aim. Which is about a general health. Aim on the. On the longer term and. And on the long term objectives which are also. About Health. Whereas in. Intervention have been these are taken together into health outcomes. Then if you look at the next part. Which is mainly about the determinants of health or of what out a cause of health in intervention mapping these are called behavioral. Outcomes. And then. To make the behavioral outcomes more specific. We define. Performance objectives. Whereas in the public health cycle. These are called intermediates. Objectives. And here you see there were church. Behavior. So it also relates to behavior with an intervention mapping these behavioral directives are. Stated. More specifically by also defining performance objectives. Then when you then go to the next part. Intervention many. Thing we talk about. Change objectives. The objectives on the level of. Determinants. So what kind of attitudes to we like to see at the end of the program. What kind of skills what kind of knowledge and in. The logic model of the public health cycle. These are referred to as initial. Object if and he or she. You also see the word. Behavioral determinants. So to a large extends the two approaches. Are similar but there are some small differences. And especially the terminology is very difference between the two approaches. OK so I've told you about stiffer answers. And similarities. When it comes to defining objectives in both models.

Because there are some similarities but also some differences. Basically is the difference between the two approaches that. In the public health cycle. The needs assessment. Is more like a generic general. Way of looking at the cause us of health. There's an intervention meant being you go into much more detail into behaviors and determinants of behaviors. These could get back also in the meta system and. Of the public health cycle. But it's not necessarily in such a specific way. Explore it in a needs assessment. If you look here you will see that there is a need to system and. In the public health cycle it's the first step. And also an intervention mapping it's the first thing that you do. Exploring the problem and. What causes the problem. And also looking for ways to solve the problem for solutions. And I think the most important reason why there is a difference between the two. Need to assess men's. Is that you object if it's different because in the public health cycle. The aim of the needs assessment is mainly for policy making to develop a group policy and together with the government. At the local or national level. Whereas in intervention having the need to assess ment is mainly used to develop an intervention program. So something that's going to be used in practice. So the public health cycle. Focus on policy making and intervention there being is the focus is on intervention development. So in both assessments. You look at health. And quality of life. You can look at C.P.D. mere logical data to get a good idea about what the health problem. Exactly is among whom. Where where that are any trends. And this can be very similar in both. Process this. Although I think that. When policies are made. There is even more emphasis on the assessment of health and quality of life. Whereas in intervention being. The emphasis is much more on. Exploring behavior should and determinants of behaviors. So that is the focus of intervention mentoring and a lot of scientific theories are also used to explore behavior and. Determinants of behavior. Whereas in the public health cycle. There is a more generic. Way of looking at the causes of health. And there's also use of certain models. But these models are often. Also known by policymakers themselves. So also in exploring the causes of health. In the public health cycle. There is a lot of involvement of policymakers in this process. And trying to speak the language of the policy makers. Themselves. So yeah. In this clip I've explained to you. The difference between the public health cycle and intervention happening when it comes to the need to system and. Thank you.\n",

Collaborate in this whole process. Then in Safin she met Bing intervention mapping is a model that the scribes. How to get from policies. To Health Promotion interventions. Or how to develop. Health motion interventions in itself. Also here it's a lot about is collaboration between developer and planners. And very often intervention mapping health promotion specialists and behavior change the shifts are involved in this process. So how does intervention mapping fits in the public health cycle.

                "text": "Hello. Welcome to this clip. About external determinants. As you know there are extra know and personal determinants of behavior. And especially the part of the external determinants can be a bit difficult to understand. So in this clip. I would like you to explain what. External determinants. Are. And I would like to use an example of the use among youth. Fifteen to eighteen years olds. And especially about binge drinking so drinking. So much. Whole. Also drinking alcohol for the purpose of getting drunk. And that's a major problem in many countries. And what you see is. The boy sitting here. Drinking a lot of alcohol. And you also see that there are a lot of extra nl influences. That's going to make this boy. Drink too much alcohol for example. Peer pressure. I think you can recognize that. But also the role of parents may be very strict. To their child. The availability of alcohol in supermarkets for all kinds of youth. Under eighteen years olds. And also national policies. Whether youth. Are allowed to buy and to drink. Under a certain age. So these are all. Extra no determinants of. This whole drinking behavior. It's not something within the boy himself. Of course. The personal part is how he deals with all these external influences. If we look at this example. We would say. And put it in the intervention repping perspective. He would say that binge drinking is the behavior of the at risk group. So again we are in. FACE. Three. And of course this can lead to. Health problems. For example demonstrate a brain is a very important health problem. It can lead to overweight. It's kind of course also leads to increased chance of addiction to alcohol. And of course these health problems interns. Can decline the quality of life of these young people. So. But what we are specific. Specifically looking at now is what are the determinants of this binge drinking. Behavior. That's faced for. OK. What I'm going to explain you now is. Intervention moving. You need to translate. The external determinants. Into. Behaviors. Of others. So for example. The binge drinking by young people is influenced by personal determinants. For example young people do not have enough knowledge about the damage that's been caused to dare to bring. And also. External determinants. For example. Young people can easily buy alcohol. In a shop. For example. So now what you do. In translating the external determinants into behavior. Is that you take this extra know the terminals and think who can be responsible for having young people buying alcohol in the shop. Very easily. So you translate this into a behavior. Of on. Environmentalists actor. And that's good be. Supermarket many of your fish. The environmentalists actor. So whole. So all youth. And that is the behavior. So in that sense you translates. An external determinants of behavior. Into a behavior of someone else. An external person. That's important because if you later on want to develop an intervention. This is something that you need to. Specifically look at your intervention or maybe you have to develop an intervention for a supermarket. Men are Jewish. Specifically. And this can go on and on because also this behavior is influenced by personal determinants. And by X. or no. Determinants. So for example the supermarket men are Jewish. They approve of selling alcohol to youth. So they think it's fine. They don't see a problem. It's in their personal attitude. But there can also be extra not determinants here. For example. There is a law that prohibits young people to buy alcohol. But it's not implemented well. It's not controlled. Well by the government. Whether supermarket minute us really acts upon That's regulation. So then again. Also dish you can translates into a behavior of an environmental actor for example. Officials working at the Ministry of Health. They implemented a law that prohibits alcohol. Buying among young people. And then again you can look at this behavior at Spurs tional determinants of these Minister of Health officials. And again also the external determinants. And this can go on and on and on it depends on the complexity of the. Of the health problem. OK so I've explained to you about X. or no determinants of behavior and how these can be translated into behaviors. Of environmental activist. Thank you.\n",

                "text": "My name's christian bombs. And now i would like to tell you about the next level of regulation of genes. D.n.a. and protein. Modifications. Allow higher level of regulation. Beyond the transcription of regulation. That is imparted by a promoter. Which is the basic level of gene regulation. So i'm going to talk about the types of chemical modification that you find on d.n.a.. The types of modifications that you find on proteins. And the relationship between the number of genes. And proteins. In an organism. And the way in which d.n.a. and proteins sometimes together. Can be modified. And act on. Gene regulation. Now. D.n.a. and proteins they code for. Complex polymer us. D.n.a. is composed of. Individual nucleotides. The bases. A c. g. and t.. And these are linked together. By phosphor related sugar residues. That form the backbone of each strand of the two strands of the d.n.a.. Proteins are formed out of an almost infinite combination of the twenty. Basic among us it's that form life. Now d.n.a. codes for anything between a handful of genes. Required for simple life forms such as viral oids. And many many tens of thousands of genes. In higher life forms such as plants. Due to the many modifications that can occur in proteins. There are many more proteins than genes. A gene in a genome. Can be transcribed and. Different transcripts of one gene. Due to alternative splicing can form. Several different proteins. For the wrong. Due to the. If occasions of the proteins. You can get. Many many different forms of a particular protein. Because they have been modified. So you start off with. Approximately thirty to fifty thousand genes. In a genome. That specify. All the attributes. For an organism. And you end up with. Millions of proteins. That can result from these relative small number of genes. Now the types of modifications we find commonly. Are things like. Addition of force for groups. Phosphorylation. As a tile group saw me fall groups in acid elation and methylation. And then. Admission of sugar residues. Such as in glycol selection. These individual modifications of proteins. Can lead to an activation. That is frequently the case of phosphorylation. They connect the signals. For other proteins to bind. To them and also. Can act on the structure of a protein. As is the case with acetyl a sion which. Then changes the shape. And frequently with. Glycol. They can actually. Inhibit the activity. Or in fact heart enhanced the activity of individual enzymes. These modifications often occur in the golgi apparatus. Of the sell off the translation. Now. D.n.a. on the other hand. Has primarily one type of. Modification chemical modification. And that is the admission of a group. By me felt transferees. That we see here in the picture. And those me thout groups. Stary clee change the shape of the d.n.a. molecule. This results in preventing the preliminaries. Which makes the r.n.a.. To actually transfer. The gene properly. And will result in gene silencing. Methylation probably evolved as a mechanism for silencing unwanted genes. Introduced by viruses or retroviruses for example. Methylation can also therefore silence genes that we try to introduce via. Transformational gene technology. So one must be aware that modifications. Over generations. Of d.n.a. consignments genes. As well. D.n.a. methylation can be reversed. To produce high levels of gene regulation. However methylation. Can be also permanent. And transmitted through the germ line. So methylation can therefore result in the sort of non-man delian mode of inheritance. That is that the parents. Can be influenced by the environment. To change their methylation patton. And then. Their offspring. Will have different traits. Not present in the parents. An example of the interaction between protein and d.n.a. modification can be found in the chromosomal d.n.a. and example of this coordinated protein and d.n.a. modification. Occurs during cell. Development. And the development of an organism. At specific phases of development. Regions of the genome. Need to be opened up. Making them available for the trans scription or machinery which needs to transcribe the genes. To make messenger on. This process of. Unwinding. Is regulated by chemical modifications. D.n.a. is wrapped up in euclid's arms around proteins called histones. There are several types of these histones. Which can be shown is shown here in the diagram. As a new clue as. Round which the d.n.a. is wound. And in order to get tranced group to occur this. Structure has to be unwound. To make it available for the enzymes that produce the r.n.a.. This is done by a series of different modifications known transcribed regions. Tend to be highly. Have highly methylated d.n.a. as shown in the bottom panel. Where we have. Methylation in the d.n.a. and. No modification in the protein. While. In an active. Chromatin. Active region of the genome where genes of being transcribed. The histones. Proteins around which the d.n.a. is bound to settle lated. They are modified chemically by the admission of a style group. And that helps to unwind. These proteins. A methylation. Is reduced by dean methylation of the d.n.a.. Allowing the. Transcription to proceed. Orderly. Thank you clue ssion. I'd like to say the d.n.a. and proteins. Act together. To allow no almost infinite variation of. Gene regulation. On the higher level. On a chromosomal level. Although there are only a few tens of thousands of genes. There are many more. Proteins in a living cell that. Than actually genes themselves. Furthermore d.n.a. proteins. Can be modified and act together. To give high levels of regulatory finesse. Over what a promoter. And a gene. Could and transcription factors and. Genes actually. Can provide. With i thought like two and.",

                "text": "My name's december. And today. I'm going to ask you the question. What is a gene. During the talk. We will outline the gene structure. Its basic elements. We will look at the details the certain structures and how the gene codes for. r.n.a. and. These get converted into. Proteins. We will talk in more detail about the promoter function. And proteins that allow the precise regulation of gene expression. Now geneticists will call a gene a locus or point on the chromosome that defines a trait. Such as flower color. Molecular biologist on the other hand will probably say that a gene. Is a sequence of d.n.a. that encodes a protein. And its regulatory elements. So we can subdivided gene. Into its regulatory region that we call the promoter. And its actual coding region. Which is the transcript. Which then goes on to be translated into a protein. Now adjacent to the promoter the. Transcribed region is composed of a five prime. Untranslated region. The coding region and. A three ft prime. Untranslated region. The coding region itself. Starts with a star code on. And stops with a stop code on. And in between that. Triplets of nucleotides encode individual and minor acids which go. To form a peptide. That is then converted into a protein with n. zer matic function or structural function. Depending on the type of protein. In higher. Organisms such as you carry out switch have a new clear envelope. There are additional. Intervening sequences. In the coding region. Which do not themselves code for any protein. Means. But just interrupt. The gene. So we have the. Exons which are the coding regions in the in trans which of these intervening sequences. So we end up with a quite a complicated structure. That's composed of the promoter of five prime u.t.r.. The protein code. Protein coding region. Composed of these exons. And intervening in trunks. And finally at the back end. We have the. Three prime. Untranslated region. Now in the. Gene as a whole. It's the big that here again with its promotes a coding region intervening region. That is faith really reproduced as. r.n.a.. But this r.n.a.. Cannot be translated. Yet. Because it still has these intervening sequences. So then we arrive at that. Processing of this. Premiss and john a where the in transit spliced out. That can happen and sematic lee and partly also order catalytically. Where these in transit taken out a cap. Site is added which a modified nucleotides to the front end. And a series of a bases. Are added to the back end of the gene. These modifications enhanced ability. In the cell. This. Mature messenger r.n.a.. Can then be transported to the wire where it will be translated. To form a peptide. And eventually a protein. Now to go back to the promoter region. And how that functions. In its. Regulation function. For motors have individual. Sequences. Such as here depicted at tathra boxall. T. a t. a sequence. To which a transcription factor a protein combine these transcription factors are of none the ts. To. Yeah there with accessory proteins that help to bind and add stability to the complex. These transcription fact the complex's can recruit an r.n.a. preliminaries. Which is the actual enzyme that produces the transcript. Together with whole series of other proteins. These transcription or complexes. Assemble. On the promoter and move up towards the start of transcription. Frequently then the on a problem arise undergoes a phosphorylation activation and. The aren't a problem arise. Can produce. The premiss and join a. Which as we discussed. Then gets processed into a final mature. Messenger r.n.a. that can be translated that the why design. There are many such. Boxes such sequences that bind transcription factors. Here is the pic that just one of them. There are many and. All these different boxes that bind different transcription factors. Specify the time point. In terms of the development of the organism. And also the organ. In which this gene. Is meant to be transcribed. And so we have. Regulatory sequences. That can define. All these individual stages. Organs. For the transcription of a gene. If you clue ssion. I like to say that d.n.a. is a hugely versed amalfi. Molecule. It codes for proteins. It binds proteins. It specifies when and where these genes are expressed and it's a huge variation. That is as yet. Largely undiscovered.",

                "text": "Today we look at the spoilage of fast. Spoiling products and. The behavior of microorganisms. And these type of products. So one product which is extremely perishable. Is fish fish. Have a very short shelf life. And one of the reasons for this is that fish. Contains fat protein and. Is only trying to a bit of carbohydrates but also for other defect in the protein. Are good nutrients for the microorganisms. Also fish. Often contain the treatment deal I mean oxides. And this is an awesome regulatory system in the fish. But this also has an impact of the shelf life. As we can see later. So fish is extremely perishable. Because the flesh of the fish has quite a high ph. During the death struggle of a fish. There is no postmortem acidification. So the fish. Keeps on struggling. And then consumes always and I see all the sugar and all the glycogen. And then at a certain moment dies. Due to extortion. Then at that moment. Just. All the physiology and the self stops. And there is no post-mortem. Acidification. As there is with normal meat because normal meat. As a lower ph. Because if a normal. Animal is slaughtered. The oxygen transferred to the cells. Is cut. And then there is still new cause and league which are available. Which is transferred to lactic acid. So there is in the slaughtering of animals. And on a process. Then in. Fish in the fish. The older glucose is finished and no lactic acid any more be produced. The second thing. What is important for the fish. Is that all these look like those is consume sort of a snow globe goes left. And therefore the microorganisms that are going to grow. There are going to look for the next substrate and out of proteins and. Proteins if you break them down there are sold for a nitrogen available. And that can then make quickly. Compounds that you can smell. Very easily. Also due to the fact. D M A O is present. Modified atmosphere bracketing is less effective. Because D. and. A.O. also can be used as. Electronic scepter for biological reactions. So fish. Is extremely perishable. And therefore I stored my fish. That I bought. In my cooling box. And you can see that this fish is schools. And it's also. If you read. On the label. There is modified atmosphere packaging in order to inhibit the growth of aerobic. Microorganisms and also with a higher carbon dioxide a little bit. The growth of the anaerobic microorganisms. Also of course. After opening these packets. I'm going to put do to heat up my food products with. Which also an act of faith a little bit the microorganisms. So fresh fish. Is largely. Perishable and therefore we have all kind of processes. To reduce the growth of microorganisms. And I've got here of my. Unselfish feely and this is a product. Work which is heat treatment had set then canned and also a lot of salt as adults to inhibit the growth of the microorganisms So this again. Is a shelf stable products. So fish. Is one example of and quickly. Pressure both food products. But we have also water food products like. For instance got to fetch a bowls. I bought this morning this leak. And this was not in the cooling. Also here I don't store it on a cold conditions. Because this is a whole leak and the dust not spew. Spoil that quickly. However we also have ready to eat vegetables. And this are sliced vegetables that are very handy. To use in the kitchen or you can directly. Consume them or directly. Use them and cooking. And this product. I did find in the cooling. I also started in my cooling box. And if I read the label. It also has modified that MF'er packaging. So this one has no cooling and no Beckett saying no and no modified atmosphere. This one has cooling I modified up my step back to think. Why would this one. Have these two additional hurdles. The reason is that by cutting. This this this leaks and these festivals. The structure is broken. And of course it's handy. Had I called it already ready to eat and it's handy that it's all goods. It's handy in the kitchen. But. Realized that also from the perspective of the micro-organisms this product. Is ready to eat. Because. What have we done with this product. We have got all the cells and. Older nutrients. They became available. It's all the interior interior of the cells of this affected balls. Are available directly for the microorganisms to consume. Well here is much more difficult for the microorganisms to find these nutrients. Also the water activity is higher due to the good thing that the cells. Gave open and a lot of water on the surface. Was available. While this product. Is quite dry on the surface. Also there is more oxygen we really mixed. This product and we made a lot more surface. Exposed to oxygen. Than we have for the whole. Leak. Also by cutting. We spread. A quantum anation if there was a local. Piece of. Soil for instance on this leak. Then by cutting as we spread it all over the. Different parts of the products. And also by cutting this. We maybe get a contamination. On or slicing machine and with us flies a machine. We can contaminate all the products that come afterwards that we are going to slice. For a lot of reasons why these. Ready to Eat food products. Are also ready to eat for the bacteria. So to summarise fish. Is an extremely perishable product. And that is mainly. The reason is that it is a good substrate. But also that is acquired neutral products and the Ph D. remains quite high. Could fetch it also also. Are extremely perishable Because that are products that are not only ready to eat for human beings. But they're also ready to eat. For the bacteria.",

                "text": "This lecture will be about sports as a station. Of meat and. Meat Products. And we are going to look at how micro going to be hafe. In the chain of meat. And then. Meat Products. For spoilage. Associations are determined by the raw material Flora. By the processing that we do. By the storage conditions how we store our food products. And by the preservation system that we use in all of food products. So what does meat meat is that. Edible part of the animal flesh it can be. Organs such as heart liver and kidneys. But mainly. It will be to muscular tissues. Of the animals. And the main production animals that we make need of. Our cows pigs. Sheep and goats and. Both free. And we can make all kinds of meat products out of these animals. So what happens now. If an animal is slaughtered. After the animal is slaughtered had. It's taken off. And from that moment on. There is no to or. The animal cannot breathe anymore and there is no transportation of oxygen anymore to the cells of the animal. Normally in those cells. There is still glucose present. And if there is ocean present that has gone further to carbon dioxide and water but if there is no oxygen. Then there will be production. Of lactic acid. And that happens also sometimes when we are sporting an all muscles. But this happens also after the animal is killed. And therefore the PH of the meats will drop down a little bit from. About neutral from about six point five four seven to five point four to five point five. From that moment on. This will inhibit the Global Ethic and time activity and. There will be not real meat the bullet him anymore. However to be a she's a little bit lower than what's normally ph of meat would be. So if you look at the animal and. Before it's lot that's. We can see here a schematic representation. And we can look at the micro going. If that could be present on different locations on the animal. We have to hide the disk in the hairs and the feathers. And there are all kind of. Microorganism presence on these parts of the animal. On the skin. For instance often. Many stuff look OK are present. And these organisms. Of course also complement aid finally or. All meat. Then we have the internal parts so to real down a missile parts of the animal given here in pink that ADI internal organs. And the muscles and. They are generally very relatively free of microorganisms. So they are. You could say almost sterile. But there is also not a part of the animal and that is the and that's not fact that the gun is full of microorganisms there are huge amounts of microorganisms in the intestinal tract of animals or of human beings. So there is micro floor on these and destines and. They are often related to safety so there are. And there are bacteria like e-coli I saw him when I lived and for poultry also. Company back to the present and the intestines. If we are going to slaughter such an animal. Then we are going to remove the hair or the feathers of the animal the outsides were a lot of contaminants our presence and. In order to take that off. Of course. It will be difficult to not bring this and gone into contact with the other parts of the meat. Than we are going to take out the intestinal tract of the. And I'm also the F.S.A. The ration and. Also there it will be impossible to not have any. Features that are not present on the animal. We have to be aware that there's not too much. And if it's present. We can wash that off. And with that washing off we can get a little bit of a reduction of the contamination. Then after this step. We are going to kill. The carcass of the animal. And with the chilling Also there will be a little bit of a reduction of the microorganisms due to the cold shock that we gifted of microorganisms and due to the chilling also we dry to surface and some microorganisms. Are also by the chilling an act of faith that. If we do this process. Very well we can get two levels of about them to two to ten to the fourth micro-organisms per square centimeter. So of course the meat. That was after the slaughtering is not sterile. But we have to do fairly much our best in the whole chain in order to have the levels not too high. Apart from this condemnation coming from the animal itself from the skin and from the intestines. We should also realize that in all stages cross-country a nation. Can happen. From the factory environments. There is air presence with aero soles of a dust. We make use of process water which is also not stare all the bulbs that the animals go true in the sprays that we use. And that can be bacteria transfer from protected areas for mission or equipment. Like for instance there are other fing us that are used to take off the fed us off the chickens or. For insisted biofilms that can be present on the on the carcass got us in a factory. All these environments are not sterile and can result in contamination of all rolled meat. So this confirmation of the raw meat can be. Of levels of down to two to ten to four See if you per square centimeter. And they aren't exposed to very many. Nutrients meat. Is a very good substrate. We as human beings sometimes like it but. Microorganisms also like it very much. Because everything is in there what they would like better is what their protein. Carbon all components that are needed for Terra grows. Are present and meet. So therefore in order to give it a good shelf life we need to store this at low temperatures. And what that happens is that the Pathak are taller and Flora. Will generally develop. And here you can see a list of pluck with all of microorganisms that can grow on meat. And the one on top that Saddam on us is also the most relevant one. That is the one that generally grows fosters on. Meat Products. Because it can grow at very low temperatures. So what we can do against Saddam on us is to reduce the oxygen concentration. Because turn him on us as an aerobic microorganisms and for that sometimes meat products are stored in. Fake your own condition. Then there is no oxygen present and we have increased the carbon dioxide concentration we got an increase of the carbon dioxide concentration. This than guess. Shelf life extension of this meat. Because the plan I want to scare not grow. But homo ferment that like that I said but there you are they are facultative aerobically. They will then take over. They grow a little bit slower. Slower than the. Saddam own are so therefore we have a longer shelf life. But still they will spoil the food products. Generally don't know slimy forms. But the like to us about their produce. Said so therefore we get often. The sore as it. Taste and or. Generally if we have modified. Modified atmosphere by faking them. We get a later onset of the spoilage. At the rounds. Then to the eight So hundred million. Microorganisms per square centimeter. So the disadvantage of this fake your misses that there is no oxygen. And then sometimes. ME TOO OLD this color it will become a little bit more gray and will not half as nice red color anymore. So therefore we also make use of. Modified atmosphere bracketing. Unmodified atmosphere packaging the carbon dioxide concentration is increased. But there is still a lot of oxygen present so that we keep the red color of the meats because my will be in which. If that is connected to oxygen it will be a rat's butt if there is no as you know available it will be color less and therefore this color. The meat. So the sport of Flora. And these modified atmosphere packs food products. The bents largely on the temperature because. Temperature on itself as a big impact on the microbial growth. But also there is an mixture effect. Because the temperature also has an impact on how. Carbon dioxide to this source in the food products. And at lower temperatures. More carbon dioxide will soften the food product and lactic acid. Bacteria will dominate the for the flora. However if the temperature is a little bit higher. Less carbon dioxide will dissolve in the food products and it's not sufficient. Hi to inhabit the persona more nice an answer about traffic growth and these organizations will take over the spoilage process. We can also freeze or meet. And if we freeze had below minus eighteen degrees. We get. No microbial growth. Because the water activity is really too low and also the temperature is too low to get to an increase in the numbers. However we have to be we had it after defrosting. Or during the frosting if we do that for instance at room temperature. On the surface but the real growth can occur. Also sometimes there are enzymes of killed microorganisms that are present there. That's going to still still show activity those and the time stay can sometimes still work. Also on the freezing condition. So we also can do HIIT treatments for it on meat and Francis we have cooked ham. That we can best rise at seventy degrees then some Derma during microorganisms can still grow on such a food product and get a gift sometimes a green this Cory sation. We can also. Sterilize a food product by canning. And you can hear. See here the product spam. That has I think credence. Borgen Ham What are modified potatoes are sugar. But they're also largely unknown but then compounds in the product. Salt. And the sodium nitrate and the sodium nitrate specifically is added there to inhibit the growth of course of the in both align him. That which is a spore form and it sometimes can survive. Sterilization conditions and. Make a toxin. And therefore needs to be prevented. We can also have preserve it affect us. For mental sausages. There we preserve the food supply the antagonism. Of meant that the floor our electric as a bacteria that produce electric assets would using the Ph. Having organic I said to a food product. But in many cases those fermented sources also have higher. Sultan concentrations. And they're often. Dried. And that makes that those products sometimes can even be. Shelf stable. So this isn't. Fermented so. Such that. I found in the supermarkets. Not in the cooling. That this is a product that is shelf stable. You can just store it. Without any refrigeration because it's dry enough. And it's often a combination between lactic acid and low Ph. A lot of salt. And also drying. So that it's dry enough that no spoilage. Will occur. A little bit different. Meat. We have a little bit less of these bits of it affect us. Still needs to be in the cooling. This is my cooling books and. This meat. Really need to be cooled. And I did find it also in the cooling part of four of the supermarkets and. This meat. First of all need to be cooled but secondly if I read what on the mantel how we see that this also need to be heat treated. Before we are going to consume it so there is a big difference between these two. This one needs to be refrigerated and need to be cooked. To put it back in the cooling. This one is just a drive for fish that you can directly consume. And it's also shelf stable. So in these type of food products. There is are preservation systems with. Addition of salt. And nitrate. Specifically against cross city in both the line and. Also. For many meat products. We feel especially for the meat that they put on our sense which is. We have a process which is called slicing. And so with the slicing. We should also realize that we can often. Recon terminate a food product. So let's assume that we have this food product with. Like I said by Terry end there and we slice this. Then of course we've got a lot of lactic acid with their own a knife. If after that we are going to slice ham. For instance. Which is not fermented. Then we contaminate our hamburger like the guy said by the area. And I feed and store that food product. Those Like I said. Can grow on the ham. And they can make acid in the ham. And then you get a fermented Ham but that's not what you want. So we get. Can get additional spoilage due to reconfirmation during slicing. But of course also that can be safety issues. If you have contamination with pluck or tolerance. But there we are that are present on your slice of. Additionally we. And sometimes and processing we at. Hoops or spices and. They are also a potential source of sports or sport for most. Sometimes low levels of sport for most but sometimes. For a high level sport foremost that can contaminate of food products. So if you look at how we can make all kinds of meat products. Out of our fresh meat. We can see that there are many. Intrinsic an extra in six factors that are used in all kinds of different food products. We have or. High heat treatment process. The canned meat. Which is not any more needed to be stored. Refrigerated in this scheme. Yellow. Products are also stored refrigerated. This is gun meat. No storage. At their free at the refrigerator is needed we can also freeze a product and we have a very low temperature and. Also a low water activity because all the water became. Ice. We have cured meats who are sulfur are adults and often they are still need to be refrigerated. We have a mental meat and the F.A.Q. back the modified atom of atmospheric backed meat were additional reduction. But then so. Lowering has been used and also carbon dioxide is at it. So we have all kind of. Entrance thing an extra insect factors that are used in specific. Food products. So to summarise. Contamination of meat. Is mostly coming from the farm. And from the slaughter process. But also later on in the processing. Recon termination can occur. From equipment for instance from slicing equipment. For spoilage of meat products specifically. Dollar and microorganisms are very important because much of the meat products will be stored refrigerated just as oxygen present that will be generally try to more and I think will spoil a food product if there is no oxygen and are generally the lactic acid bacteria. And of course we should also not forget the safety aspects of our meat.",

                "text": "We are now going to look at the spoiler's associations of milk and. Of milk products and. We're going to look how. Microorganisms behave in the chain of milk. And how they behave in the dairy food product. So support us as a chef since are determined by the raw material Flora. By the processing. By the preservation. And by the storage conditions the organisms can. Already contaminate all materials. We do processing. We might have preservation factors in a food product. And finally we store our food products. And they can then. Influence the shelf life of a food product and the sports processes. So we start with such a broad look at the raw materials and. The milk is coming from a car wash and. Already doing the milking process. Contamination can occur in a raw milk from. Dirt. That is present on the exterior of the teat. That can be sometimes infections of the teeth and therefore. Micro going to has done and can come from the interior of the theat and. There can be contamination from the. Milking equipment. So we should realize starts to eat feet. And then that feed. There can be microorganisms they can then be in there and they're still tracked. That can come in their features. They can also be microorganisms. From that fate and directly from the faces to the teeth but also fight it. Betting over the cows are lying and. And also there might be microorganisms present in the soil were the cows are walking around. So contamination can come from these sources. Both from the musty does from the environment. And also from equipment for instance and decayed rubber parts of your milking equipment. If we look. Now also at the feet of our cargo then cows do eat in certain cases far made silent and that is made for instance of corn or. Of grass and. Those that material is put in big bottles and. There was electric I said to me from. Patient in order to preserve. This feat. For the cops. However there are sometimes problems in such a pile because oxygen can enter sometimes the surface layer of this bile. And then. On those locations yeast and molds can grow and. They are quite as at resistance they like even. Like the guy said and they're going to consume that lactic acid to because they see that as a substrate. So they consume galactic I said and oxygen so locally and those in the silage you can get then. Anaerobic knishes. But rather a rather high ph and. On these hot spots. But there are spores can easily. Develop. So but the bacterial spores can. Originated from the Siletz. And then can go to the features and then. Direct feed to teach or theatre and firemen's and they're all milk. Spores from bacillus and also bacteria unlikely stare I'm going to start us can also naturally occur in the soil that is. Around the house and stuck on the bed to generate bacteria. Originating from the environment. And spread to also feed and that's in all tracts of the animals like. Company bucked us home and Island. And e-coli. In certain cases. The dose of a cow can be infected. And then that can be all kinds of microorganisms present in those. And the other side of the cow and in that way contaminate all milk. And we can see what the impact is of the counts in milk. If we have a car with an acute. Must it is then we have ten to eight. Micro innocent by millimeter. If there is such a clinical must must be destroyed of about ten to the fifty. But their upper middle eastern. And if you have a healthy cow you have ten to do. But they are merely to to concede a huge impact of this disease because the difference between the two is effect a million so that one cow that has them a fetus can logically contaminate your. Big milk thank you so. Already at the farm we need a preventive measure that matches. The farmer needs. Already to work on keep the microorganisms out and. To sell for instance not to feed that moldy silage because there can be. Also dose. Force presence. The farmer need to clean the teat. And the milking equipment very well to prevent transmission. And. The producer can have an impact on this by having a specific milk quality. And System and. For instance they can get a penalty for suppliers of dirty milk or. And that sometimes. Psychologically a little bit better. To give a bonus for supplying us that supply you with. Clean milk. So that is already what the producer can do but then the milk enters the factory. And the next step is of course that's the producer. Also can work on the killing of the micro-organisms because even if the farmer works perfectly. The milk. The wrong note is not sterile. And the producer can best price the milk or. Sterilize the milk. What the possibilities are to make use of back to sort of the center of a geisha or of the milk or micro fields ration. For sterilization. And active phase most of the microorganisms and generally then the product is shelf stable. But better efficient. Back to for geisha and. Microvolt ration are processes that help to reduce the confirmation. But still some contamination will be left. And we need to make use of. Other tools to. Also preserve the. Food products. So curative measure it's like to prevent the microorganisms from growing. Like low temperature storage or low water activity or. As if occasion by fermentation and. You can see that here I have here. At best rice. Sterilized milk this is U.H.T. milk. And this milk. Is not stored refrigerated this is shelf stable. There's also a possibility. To have a dry food product so this is milk powder and milk powder is so dry. That's no microorganisms are able to grow in here. So this our. Shelf stable products we don't store them cause. However as. If milk is only. Best arised. Then we need to store it cool so therefore I think this milk from a cooling box. So this is best rice milk and. Microorganisms are present in the year and we really need. Refrigerated because otherwise it will spoil too quickly. To help. Even the professional sports a little bit more. You can. I set a fire to milk by fermentation. And this is. Fermented no product so it is but the milk which. Also need to be stored cools because microorganisms are present there it's made of best Dr milk. But it will have a little bit longer shelf life than. My normal pasteurized milk. So for these two products. Refrigeration. Is importance. So best tries food products that can be survive first like this in a serious and storm. Also some fetid aid of microorganisms that are more heat resistant. And they are well able to grow in the food products. If the product is U.H.T.. Processed. Then only some. Bacterial spores will survive and generally that are only. Domo Philip microorganisms that only do grow at very high temperature so if we stored it brought it on. Normal room temperature. It will not spoil. So post best position contaminants can also work or like tried them on us. Isn't very famous bust. Busters Haitian contaminants. And if that happens so. After the best of Haitian and before filling the package. If there is a contamination. Then. Those microorganisms. Generally will win. From the survivors of the treatment so they will more quickly. Spoil your food product. Why will that happen. First of all you have to realize that. Milk is a very good medium for growth of microorganisms even in the chilled conditions. Because on milk a little calf can grow. At this to you only nutrition at the little gal gets or. If we have human milk then. It's a baby can grow and it's the only food product that the baby is consuming so everything is in there what a human being need. And if. Already a human being or golf can grow in such a food product of a theory I'm definitely can grow on it so. Microorganisms like milk also very much. And. Even if chilled to the post contaminants can very well grow a. Such a product. And why did I win. Because often those posts. Postprocessing contaminants. Are low temperature growers like them on us can grow very well at low temperatures. And also. These organisms are no spores so they have no germination time they do not need first to germinate. Like this in a serious or instance needs to do. So we have all kinds of milk products that we can make out of a roll milk. We have seen. Best rise milk that has had to heat treatments. And is also refrigerated so. Products that are given here and yellow are refrigerator products to you it's the milk has had a more severe heat treatment. And therefore it is shelf stable. We don't need to reference ration anymore. And we have also for mental food products who are sometimes also sold as adults we have a dried milk powder where we have a very low water activity to make the product shelf stable. And we asked specifically for their E. products. Also the making of cream and the making of butter. Where we have separation of the milk and the defense face. We have a separation. And specifically for butter. We also have to compartmentalisation how to better isn't. Continuous oil faced with water droplets and there. Where we have separated. The microorganisms from all the nutrients there is only locally. A little bit of nutrients available and that gives it a better shelf life. You did ask. That compartmentalisation but still. We need to refrigerate or better. Order wise it will still. Still going to spoil too quickly. So to summarize we can prevent prevent spoilage of food products. Of dairy food products bio kind of processes like fermentation heat treatments. By chilled storage. And by low water activity. But we have to realize that sometimes spoilers can occur by. Post-treatment contaminants. From one side and survive us from raw materials. After the heat treatments. From the other side.\n",

                "text": "Processing of food is very important for the preservation and wood processing we influence microbial growth and or. An active facial. The processing factors are used to control the quality but we have to realize that we have to always balance between the quality. The shelf life. And the costs of the processing. And the targets of the processing. I generally removal. For instance by washing or destruction. Killing by friends of sterilization. Order adduction order to fifty. For instance by cooling a food product what are the micro going to do not grow that fast. So to say it in other words. Your objective of processing. Is to keep them out. To kill them or to keep them from growing. So to keep them out. Can sometimes be done by specific sourcing of your own materials from certain locations. Or by having better hygiene. And your in your factory or in your kitchen. To kill them. You can do by for instance radiation. High pressure technology. Or by heating processes and. Keep them from growing. You can do by influencing all kinds of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in our foods like Francis ph or temperature water gas atmosphere. So the first. Processes that we use. Are ready ation ready ation. Can have all kinds of different wavelengths. We can have. Wavelengths that. Are fairly low. So a very low frequency. That are friends of radio waves. Higher frequency is infrared. Then we go to the physical light to ultra feel out. To X. rays. And finally to come are a set of very high frequency. For the physical light range. Is only a very narrow part of this whole range of wavelengths. And this is here. And lots. So this is the face of a light that we can see. But with radio waves we can also a little bit and I can fake microorganisms but it does not work very effect. Effectively. With infrared light. We can heat. Surfaces of food products and without heating we also INEC to fade. The micro. And I sense however that visual effect by the ready ation. Is fairly minor or not present. Also with visible light. And with ultra feel that we can make use of THAT'S do a little bit and eye to fade micro-organisms but it's also not very effective. And specifically very effective is ready ation. So if you look at these. Ready ation processes. We often make use of. The microwave radiation. Many people have a microwave in the kitchen and also in food processing line sometimes microwaves are used. The advantage is that it is a quick process. It readily available. It's easy. The disadvantage is that in many cases we get a non-uniform heating and especially in active facia due to the process of microwave. Is mainly by the heating and. In many cases we have cold spots and on those locations to microorganisms are not an act of faith that. You feel lives. Can be used and has no taste effects on a footballer so that is the advantage. However the you feel light. As a low penetration Dept. And the energy is easily absorbed by zero kind of soul you would so therefore it's not very effective deeper in the food products. But it can be used for instance this infection. Of air. In bakeries. And the purification of water coming rays are very effective. Too and I preferred microorganisms. To have a very good penetration. Dept and. There is an instant process that is uniform. All over the food product. However the disadvantage is that there is a lot of consumer assistance. Against the use of eradication. It is in certain cases used for spices. Because it's generally. Difficult with autumn that it's. To inactivate microorganisms and spices without getting. Taste defects. So apart from radiation. There is also the processes that this. Sometimes used. Which is high pressure processing and. High pressure processing. Is affected for feta data cells and for fungi. For instance pressures or four of make up a skull are used during five minutes and then you get a one. Production. Four hundred make up a skull is a fairly large. Pressure because here that MF'er pressure is about. Point one. Make up a skull for an ad make up a skull is much higher and to get a feel of what for on that make up a skull. Means. I have fear. One cent. And that this is one sentence a very small thing. It's not used anymore in the Netherlands. And this sense of this would be on the floor. And I would put two elephants on the scent that would stand on this sense. That is about the presence of two elephants that's the pressure. Or for not make up a skull. To compare it. What's the pressure will be on microorganisms you can imagine. If two elephants would stand on the scent. It will probably be deformed. But microorganisms need these type of pressures to be deformed and to be an act of faith that. So to an act of faith sports. It's even more difficult any telephone to make up a skull so even higher precious. It's different if they are germinated So if we first give them a heat shark. Sometimes they germinate and then they can more easily be an active fated end for one of my guys but skull will be sufficient. So therefore they are often combination processes temperature and pressure in order to inactivate spores. So the advantages of high pressure processing. Are that it is instantaneously. And uniform. There is little effect on the quality of the food products. However the disadvantages are that. For spores on certain. And as I'm sure need a really high prices in order to enact the fades and so I'm sort of sports. And also it's difficult. A difficult process to scale up. And to have a continuous process. Also develops. The process. For an actor fading micro-organisms is the polls. Electric fields. Process. And pulse electric fields are furry. Thirty. Rep its changes of the full touch. Over the microorganisms. With a very high voltage but a very high full of. Fifty kilo folds and. The frequency is milliseconds. So that again. Is a very strong process because you know the sockets in your will. If you put your fingers here as human being you will die. This is Ciro point two tricolor folds has two hundred thirty falls and it has a twenty minutes to go and seconds frequency. So microorganisms really need. Much higher fold which is a much higher frequency is. To be in activated. So you might think that you are strong. I would realize those microorganisms. Are much much stronger than you are. So apart from. Both electric field. High pressure and ready ation. And often used. Processing technology as heat and activation. And for heat and activation we make use of all kinds of different temperature ranges and times. There are pastoral station processes that take place at. Between sixty and eighty degrees during a couple of minutes. And some butter joints and some spore forms will survive these processes. However. Also many of them will be an act of faith that. We have also a process which is called. About the station after the collapse appear. Or sterilization. And there only nonpathogenic survive us that can develop in the products. That cannot develop in the product because for instance they only grow at very high temperatures. And therefore we call such a product not sterile because there is still a little bit of life present. But we call it a commercially sterile. On the normal conditions. The product will not spoil. We also have blanching processes that are around. Boiling temperature of water and. During a couple of minutes and it is often used for decontamination for instance. After slicing fashionables. And these processes are meant to decontaminate the surface. And also to enact the fate and sometimes. Hot steaming is sometimes used to do an act of fate. Microorganisms on spices and prepare sort of station that is a few seconds at sixty degrees. Is sometimes used to prolong to shelf life of milk and store it's thanks Francis. Hot room and activation is done for eg powder. That is a couple of days at fifty to fifty five degrees because that part of cannot be at higher temperatures because otherwise. The protein. Will be broken down. And also the processes Soofi to processing. That is used in the French for French cuisine products. And that is a combination treatments. The product is stored on the fake them there is a multi treatment of ninety degrees ten minutes. And the product is stored refrigerated. So there is a combination of preferred US you could say fake IM storage. A multi treatment. And refrigeration and together these three hurdles. Make a good quality food product. With a good. Shelf life. So to summarize. Preservation processes are used and staff are Stargardt's always to keep them out. To kill them. Although prevents the microorganisms from growing. In order to kill. Microorganisms there are a large amount of processes that we can use. But it's difficult to optimize and to decide exactly for the right process programme of those two dogs. The safety and. The spoilage. Of your food products.",

                "text": "This lecture is about quantitative microbiology. Sort of quantitative aspects of growth. And activation. In preservation of food products. We often make use of a combination of factors. And in many cases these are empirically derived from. Just experience like in for mental sausages we make use of salts. Drying low b.-h. and the addition of lactic assets or the production of lactic acid by by fermented of organisms in hot cheeses there is also salt presence. There is drying. And there is lactic acid produced. And in fruit preservatives for insists there is often a lot of sugar added. But the product is also heated. So we make combinations of factors. To influence the growth and survival of microorganisms. And this is also called. The hurdle effect. With different hurdles we try to inhibit the presence and the growth of microorganisms. So that our combinations of subdermal factors which together preserves the food product sufficiently. Well. Each factor on its own. Might not reach the same. Because in many cases if you have just only one factor i want to totally unable to grow out of the microorganism. The food will be. Not very tasteful. In many cases. These are and perfectly. Dryest. However if we want now to change something in our products for instance we have a new product formulation we want to have less sugar or less sultana food products. Or we have a new process. We have an. You an activation treatments all we have friends is a small a can size or we make use of new packaging material. Or we have a new target group. For instance we are going to produce products for the elderly of our children. Or. There are new microorganisms because we are friends just taking a raw materials from another country where you can have an order ecology. Or. We have a change of the microorganisms and time because of course biology continues. In those cases. We need of course to guarantee the safety of our food products and also prevent them from spoilage. So we need to understand how all these different factors do. Influence the growth of the micro-organisms. If there is such a change in our product formulation or in our process. We have to evaluate the potential of the whole health risk. Or spoilage. And if you have such a question. And you want to predict what will happen. You have. Difference possibilities. One of the things to start you can ask an expert. You take your telephone. You call the experts. And you ask. We are going to do this. What do you see as. Possibilities. And our risks increasing and. What should we do. The advantage of asking an expert. Is that you often get a very quick response. And you get directly an indication if the proposed changes are a good or about id. But often. The disadvantage is that it is not very quantitative. The expert will say yeah. The risk will increase but. If you don't say but. How much. If we were lower to sugar. How much lower. Should we decrease a temperature. That type of quantitative. Responses. Are generally difficult to get from an expert. Also a possibility is that you go to a laboratory and you do a challenge that's. So deliberately contaminate your food product as an organism. And then follow. The growth of the organism in time. And you just see what the effect of the shelf life will be the big advantage of this test is that at this present to death for exactly the question that you have asked and. Expected a product and the organism that you have tested. But that's also directly the negative side of it because it's only a representative for x. actually those conditions that you did test. And also challenged tests are very. Bank consuming and therefore expensive. You can also do a storage test so then you don't contaminate the microorganism. The microorganism in the foot product. But you just follow the fate of the microorganisms that are present in your food product so it's a test. On the natural conditions. So all these tree. You can use. But a third too. Is quantitative microbial. And quantitative microbiology he described the fate of the growth of micro micro organisms by magical matter mathematical models. And the first. Model start we use in predictive microbiologists. Are. What is called. Primary growth models. They give the contamination level of microorganisms in time. And that is. As we have seen the. Described by the specific growth rates we have had a confirmation level. With a lot of them scale of the number of microorganisms in time. And the microorganisms that grow exponentially with a specific growth rate which is equal to the lower in a must to be filed by the generation time. So this is a primary model to describe the fate of the microorganisms in time. However that is the first step. We also need a second step and that is to look at the effect of the variables of the intrinsic an extra in six factors of a food product and of the environment of the food products. What effect they will have on the specific growth rate of the organism. And that other secondary growth models. So a secondary role model for instance for the effect of ph. This can often be described by a parabolic equation. We as an secondary model for the effect of temperature. We have first and quadratic increase increase of the pacific growth rate with increase in temperature at a certain moment to reach a maximum. And then we go to action on temperature where you're going to him cannot grow any more so we also have secondary models to describe the effect of. The environments. And their food characteristics. On the growth of our microorganisms. These we can then combine. And together with the characteristic of the microorganisms calculate how fast a microorganism will grow. And for that. We will look at an example and. This example is to steer him on a stock you know so he has an optimum specific growth rate of one per hour. And it has a lot of characteristics about a minimum growth temperature of minus one point five degrees. And optimum temperature is thirty seven. The minimum ph of four point four. Done ph of six point nine. And i'm action ph of. Nine point four and a minimum water of. If at the or point one two. So making use of these models and these models are called hummer models. We can make use of the relative effect of the temperature. The relative effect of the b.h.. And the relative effect of the water activity. So below water activity point one to the organism does not grow and spittle in point nine do it linearly increases until one. It has an optimum. B.h. of six point nine and. The minimum ph of four point four and a parable of behavior. The organism has a minimum growth temperature of minus one point five. And then. Increases quite radically with the temperature. So we can make use of mathematical equations the parameters of the microorganisms. And then we can enter the characteristics of our food products and the storage conditions. And then. Predict how fast the microorganism will grow and for that. I have here an example where we have a fashionable product that we store at seven degrees centigrade. The ph is four point five and the water activity is point nine nine seven. So we can then fill in the temperature of seven or rather the road. Temperature growth model equation. We can fill in the ph of four point five in our quadratic equation. And of what our activity of point nine seven and. What our activity. Equation and. We can then see what the relative effect is of the street hurdles. So for temperature at a temperature of seventy degrees we are at a rather low temperature so we are fairly far from the optimum so the relative effect. Of temperature is that the growth rate is five percent of what it would be at optimum conditions. Also for ph. We are far from the optimum ph of six point nine. Because the ph is four point five. We are very much near to the border of this organism which is four point four. So therefore also there are others as a factor ph. It started to seven percent of the growth rate at optimum conditions. For water activity we are out of water at their city. Of point nine nine seven. While the minimum water activities point one six zero where we are very close to the maximum value so the. Relative effect. Of what activity. Is point nine six or is only a very slight slight reduction of. The growth rate due to the weather activity in this wood products. So we haven't. Hama. D.. Of five percent. How much the age of about eight percent. And how much water activity of point one six and. Overall we could then get a factor of point zero zero three seven. Since the organism i specifically told rate of one of the optimum conditions we can predict with this. With these equations that a specific growth rate is zero point zero three seven per hour. This is a very slow slow growth rate so the organism will not grow faster and we can see that by calculating the generation time. Which is the lower end a must do divided by a specific growth rate. And that's hundred and eighty eight hours so it takes for this organism. And this food product. Eight days. To multiply. So this in is an example where both. The hurdle temperature and the whole b.h.. Give a large reduction of the growth rate. But this isn't quite. Acidic food products. So let's now look what these equations. Will do if we have chicken breast which has a much higher ph so. The temperature and the water activity are the same. But the ph. Is much higher. We are much more close to the optimum ph of six point nine. And therefore we can. The optimum ph not them and ph is six point nine. The ph of my food product is six point four so we are very near to the optimum ph and therefore also the road limiting effect. Of the ph. Is ninety six percent so it's almost. On the percent there's not much effect of the ph on the growth of this organism. So again. We have the same for the temperature the same hum of other water activity. And the overall. Limiting effect of this food products. Microorganism combination is that quote. Limiting effect is five percent of that. At optimum condition. So we have a specific growth rate of zero point zero four five. And that means that we have. Integration time. Of fifteen hours. So it's more than a factor than lower than what we had and that's such a double product. And the reason is that in this case. The only real. Road hurdle. Is the temperature storage of the food products the chicken breast. Is a very good substrate for the organism. It's only the temperature. That is limiting the groat. We can also see with these car collisions. What the effect of storage of pending research would be so not sat on the race but then the reason we don't move a little bit and this curve in comparison to the form of transparency. And the growth limiting effect. Is not five percent but it's going to nine percent so it's about almost a factor to increase in the growth rate. So we got it. In this case. Growth rate of zero point zero eight to generation time of eight point four four five. Eight point four hours. And that's about half of what we had. At seven agree so we can compare different factors what us the growth and editing effect of the different hurdles. But also for one factor we can compare. What will be the effect of going from seven to ten degrees. So to summarize. Predictive mike rizzo logy is a good two to help to predict the risk and the shelf life of food products. It's a good tool. Next to asking experts to look in the literature to do a challenge that's and to do a storage test. All these four sources of information. Are relevant and useful to practice. So the hum approach making use of the hum effect us the effect of. Temperature ph water up there for the lactic acid etc. To rank factors and to see how to influence the growth of the tarea. Food. This is a very strong approach. In order to predict. Food safety. And also shelf life predictions of food. It is it. Do. So we should not consider this as the absolute truth. It needs to be validated. With storage sites and general stats. But together. This gives you a good confidence in. How all these factors influence. The safety and shelf life of our products.",

                "text": "Microbial growth. Is influenced by. Intrinsic factors by. Extrinsic fact us. And by the pros i think that we do. But also by implicit factors. Implicit factors are the properties of the microorganisms themselves and also interactions between. The microorganisms. And the main. Important property of microorganisms. Is their specific growth rate. Under up to one condition so if everything is suitable for the organism. How fast will of the fight how fast will it grow. And on average. Bacteria have a maximum specific growth rate of two point three per hour. And that means. Generation time. Of point three hours so that's twenty minutes. So in twenty minutes you get to a new generation and. In forty minutes the second generation and so on the one extreme organism which grows fast this is close to the imperfections. And that one has a specific growth rate of six point six per hour as meaning. A generation time. Of point one hour. So that is six minutes. So realize what's. Incredibly fast this microorganism can grow. It is six minute times and replicate his d.n.a. it makes all the new proteins that makes a new cell wall that makes all the new cell constituents and. After six minutes at the fight. That i should build a cell. And again. In the next six minutes. Again. Replication takes place. So it is incredibly fast growing. But that needs to be at optimum conditions so. The medium need to be of. Optimum conditions the temperature need to be optimum and that is for this organism at forty seven to greece. And of course that is not a temperature where we generally store food products. Use generally have a little bit lower. Smaller. Specific growth rate on the optimal conditions of one point four two a generation time under optimal conditions of about a half an hour. And molds. Even grow slower. They are a factor than slower than eastern africa generation time. Under optimum conditions of about five hours. So in general in sport. For food. It's the one with the highest growth rate at all generally dominates the flora of a food product. And that the ben spot of the mexico's pacific growth rates but of course not only. Because this. Growth rate. Is also reduced by certain artifact us. So if the growth rate is also limited by other conditions like a low water activity by adding salt by a low. Ph. By the conditions that. Also influence the microorganisms but specifically if the nations are. Optimum. Then generally bacteria. Will grow faster than yeast and yeast will grow faster than. Malts. And also important factor. For the properties of microorganisms is their. Prehistory the fit what we also call. The fish a logical state. It depends what the history of the cell has been. If it starts to grow in a certain food product you're going to have can come for instance from exponentially growing cells so it was already multiplying fairly quickly on the good conditions. And then and of a new nice. If they had a conditions are again good. It will just continue growing. But in order cases the organism was in a special area face so it did stop growing. It was prepared to stay in a rest. State and then. If it and thus a new food. Commodity. And then we'll start to grow it needs to adapt to that new food product and will. At the beginning. Have a slower growth. So also previous exposure to and far mental stretches where for instance. We have been freezing the organism or. Have been drying. Its organism in a very much dr state. It is stressed. It's not on or up to the commission and if it then comes again in a new environment where it can. Well grow it will take some time before it really takes off. Also an important. History is the spore formation. We have to kill cells and at a certain moment they can form spores within the cell. And at a certain moment the cell the lice and the spores. Are left. And these spores are really survival capsules. They can withstand furry better conditions like very high temperatures. Fairly dry conditions very as. Conditions. Often they're going with that withstands cleaning and that's infection. And these spores haven't. Ferdi long life. Even if we go to mummy sense. Go to grace or fairy or. And sometimes. If we look there. We can still find spores and we can. Re five of them and let them grow. If they get to a new environments where they can grow day first have to germinate and become a cell and to take some time before they start growing. And therefore the history of the cells if they have formed spores or if they have been stressed. Are important to see what will happen. Afterwards. If they entered a new state. We also have. Interactions between microorganisms and they can interact in all kinds of different ways. They can compete with each other and. That's means that one organism is for instance using the same substrate as the organism and they are both competing for that and. It could be that bodes. Organism stand. Compete and are suppressed. But being presence together. In certain cases it can also be that the competition is such that only one of the two. Has the disadvantage of this competition and the other is not influenced by this competition. So this is you could say a negative corporation. But there is also symbiosis. And symbiosis is an. Obligate. Cooperation between micro organisms. So it's positive for both organisms. And a and b.. Really need each other if they are not. Together in a certain niche. They are not able to grow. This does not happen that often in biology but at this soaker. But what often happens is. What is called materialism or synergism. So it's a federal data of symbiosis you could say. So. A and b.. Benefit from each other's presence. But they don't really need each other if they are alone. They can also grow but if they are together. They can do it better. They can also be comments holism. Or succession of microorganism or. One organism is simply growing and. Not influenced by the order. But the fact that a is present. This influence in a positive way. You're going to him b.. And at conferences. From that they make them at mit the lights that beacon use or for instance that a certain substrate is liberated and that both of the two organism can profit from this. They can be also a man cell is a more antagonism. And that is that one of the organism. Is producing a certain component that is really. Inhibiting. The order. Microorganism. And therefore limits it in its groat. And we can look in certain food products. If these type of competitions do occur. And we have good examples of synergy. For insists the positive effect between microorganisms in the starter cultures for your production. It's also called in your production protocol operation there are two. Microorganisms that are produced. Producing your guts that stop the corpus the most of us and like the bacillus bill garrigus. If they grow. Alone and milk they can grow but if they grow together. They grow much faster than. If they would be alone. There's also a succession of microorganisms. Because many organisms cannot break down starch. But certain microorganisms can produce and signs that break down the starch. Then sugar molecules are made. And then. It's not only one that produces this at and time that can then profit from the sugar. But it's also all the other. Other organisms around. That can profit from the sugar being present as nutrients. And a good example of and they're going to him. I like that i said but there we had a producer like that i said that they produced to get an edgy but they themselves are quite not so sensitive to the lactic acid but what about the area due to the acidity cannot grow anymore. And our example saw for instance yeast that produce uncle. They themselves can withstand that i'll call but although microorganisms are inhabited and they grow. Also important interactions between microorganisms are biofilms that we find on the eat. That we can find and process lines or on surface. And in certain cases microorganisms are in a mono layer on a certain surface. Or sometimes just a thin. Biofilm. But at a certain moment you're going to really get well developed. Biofilm structures. What kind of. Internal structure were cells. Can be kept shut. And in these biofilms and you see here. An electron microscope for the graph of such a biofilm but. All kind of. Extracellular structure. You can imagine that this biofilm protects the microorganisms. Against all kind of cleaning and this infection. Agents and. The organism is a little bit. Hidden in that biofilm. And that on the firemen put that sets. So to summarise. Implicit fact those are important factors that are correct touristic some of the microorganisms themselves. And microorganisms they do. Differ and the growth response. Because some of the organisms can grow faster than all of us bacteria grow faster than east and use go faster than molds. But it's not only debts. Also to an environment. Has an impact on how fast microorganisms grow. Grow and use them most do not grow that fast on the optimum conditions. However. On their asset and dry conditions they will win from the bacteria because they can withstand more of those extreme conditions. There are also interactions between microorganisms and there can be. They can go in all kinds of directions to move to our actions can be beneficial for the joints microorganisms or i can be neutral for certain organisms. Or they can be due to mental.",

                "text": "Temperature of storage. Is a very important factor. To influence microbial growth and in fact the facia temperature. Is an extra insect factor. So it's irrelevant. For the exterior of the food products. If you look at the whole temperature skill. From frozen temperatures. Until damper just above the boiling point of water. We can look how temperate your influence microbial growth in all these stages. And we'll start at the cold side. So in or. Freezer. Where the temperatures are below zero degrees. The group. Wrote of microorganisms is stopped. So they don't grow. However they do survive. So if we have a pea tentatively store in a freezer and store there for six months the microorganisms do not grow. The product does not spoil my cogently. However the microorganisms. Are also not killed a man in many cases survive. And if we don't thaw. This pizza. And then leave that. At room temperature differences. Those microorganisms can restart growing and. From that moment on. Spoiled a product. If we put a product in the refrigerator so between zero and five degrees. We have a very low temperature. And that permits the slow growth of bacteria. And that are mainly spoilage bacteria. Between five and fifteen so a refrigerator set a little bit higher temperature. We get some more growth of the bacteria. But between fifteen and fifty degrees. Really you have to danger zone. We get a rapid growth of many bacteria that can increase another most and also produce stocks and. Then at even higher temperatures between fifty and sixty. There is the prevention of the growth of some bacteria but. Many of them will survive. But if we get to seventy five degrees. Most but here we are in activated. Especially the fact that eight of cells of bacteria in most cases will die. In order to inactivate. Also bacterial spores starts getting better survive. More stringent conditions and also. High temperatures. We need to go to denver just above the boiling temperature. So if we have cancer food products or fruits tomatoes and pickles that are a little bit more asset than purchase between hundred and one and a fifteen degrees unnecessary to an act of faith those spores. And if we have low acid food products. We even need to go to one hundred twenty degrees. During twenty minutes to an act of fate. All the spores. In order to have a safe product. In certain food products or even go to higher temperatures for instance for the sterilization of milk. We go to age the ultra high temperatures. So those food products are three to two it's very high temperatures of about or even are both fun and forty degrees during a couple of seconds. To make the product shelf stable and safe. If we look at how. Temperature. Influences microbial growth. We can see that that can be described by the right to go ski square root equation. The effect of. Temperature on the specific growth rate of microorganisms. Is not linear. It's not exponential. No it's quadratic. So it follows a parabolic. Relation that. Wrote at a certain minimum growth temperature will be equal to zero. But if the temperature is higher than the minimum growth temperature the. Specific growth rate goes up as a parable or you can see that here in the graph. The relative growth rate. We start at the certain value growth rate is zero. And then. As a quadratic equation. That as the temperature goes up the. Specific growth rate goes up. So the relative rate. Of microorganism is the. Specific growth rates divided about a specific growth rate at the. Reference condition. Equals the temperature minus the minimum growth temperature. That if i were to be fired by the temperature and reference conditions mining. Minus the minimum growth temperature to the by were two. And the graph that you see here is an example for the effect of temperature. On the growth rate of. Coli. With a minimum drawdown but you're of seven degrees and a reference temperature of thirty seven point five. And we can see that. Until seven degrees there is no growth and from seven degrees on. The road rate increases with temperature. We have all kinds of different groups of microorganisms we have. Microorganisms that are really. Cycle felucca. So they really love the cold. So they're on. Even not able to grow at a higher temperature so for instance. They have an actual wrote down preacher between fifteen and twenty degrees so. If that organism would be for instance in our body it would not be able to grow because our body is thirty seven degrees so there really love. Only to cold conditions. You have an optimum between twelve and fifteen and a minimum between minus five and five degrees. And those organisms are found in. Arctic regions and in very cold water and therefore sometimes are present on fish. They're also tolerance microorganisms so they are able to grow at those low temperatures but. They like even more. The higher temperature so to have maximum temperatures between thirty and thirty five. They grow very well between twenty five and thirty. But they're also able to grow at the very low temperatures and example stop saddam on us and not the bacillus. There are also missile philip microorganism so they're like the intermediate temperatures. There are generally able to grow from temperatures. Between five and fifteen on. That's their optimism a tween thirty and forty and. They have a maximum of forty to forty seven. And of course. Many organisms that live in animals and live and. Human beings they are fast because they have their optimum. Adapted to the body temperature of the humans already animals. And that is thirty seven degrees for human beings. And francis. Forty two for chickens. They're also told will fill a microorganism so daily like the heat. They have minimum growth temperature of between forty and forty five so. That's normal room temperature they are not able to grow. Because that. Below their minimum growth temperature. They have to optimum. Between fifty five and seventy five and their maximum so they can grow until temperatures. Of sixty to ninety degrees. And they're also down more tolerant microorganisms out there more during. So they can withstand higher temperatures than. The maximum temperature and. They can survive mult. Best or a station. And there are two more of your expected date of self's and especially spore for most are fro assistance to these heat treatments. And examples of that are best to lie they can form spores and survive. He treatments that are. Aerobic microorganisms. And are also sports that are. Anaerobic clostridium. So they can survive. High temperatures in the sport form. But that are anaerobic microorganisms. So if you look at the minimum growth temperature of a whole range of microorganisms and there was here a table for butter genic microorganisms and for spoilage microorganisms. We can see that. Some of the pathogenic micro-organisms can grow at a rather low temperature so until. Minus two and. About one degree sold they are able to grow in a refrigerator even if the temperature is five degrees. They will grow slowly but there are able to grow. But some of the better joints will not be able to grow if we have a low enough refrigerator. If we look out for at the spoilage flora. Tried them or not as an organism that is able to grow at furry low temperatures. If this would be based on them but you're only. So based on temperature. So to mona's would be able to grow with minus a degree centigrade but we should realize that at minus eight. Water is mainly in the i state. And finally i don't want to fall based on the water activity not be able to grow at minus eight. However at temperatures of minus two and zero and so on when the water activity is still high enough. This organism is the fastest grower. So this organism. In many cases will be to foster spoiler. In food products. However it's an aerobic microorganisms so it's only able to grow in iraq the conditions so. Oxygen need to be present but then. This one will be the winner because it goes fosters at those low temperatures. Here you can see a graph of the relative rate. Of the growth of the stereo monitor don't you know it's a function of temperature. And the characteristic parameters of the stair monitor budget as are a minimum growth temperature of one degree centigrade. Reference temperature and the optimum. Thirty seven degrees. And a reference growth rate of one per hour so at thirty seven degrees centigrade. The organism has an specific growth rate of one per hour. You can see had a graph. And it's rather difficult to see but during the first degree. There is no grow this is really zero from that moment on the karada key equation. There are of course a key question we'll start. But since the temperatures are very low and. The growth rate there is also very low. It's almost seem ciro but there is a little bit of growth. At these type of temperatures. Here you can see a calculation of the data. As given in the graph that was just given. You see here the temperatures. And you can see here the specific growth rates that a skulker lead with this relative rate equation. And. This would be a good thing. To test it yourself in excel. To see if you can reproduce these data so you fill in the characteristic of the microorganism to t. minus at the rough. And specific growth rate that reference condition. And then you type in five seven ten and so on to calculate the specific growth rate. In order to then. Have a little bit of a feel of what the specific growth rate means you can calculate the generation time and the generation time mr logarithm of two divided by the specific growth rate and the specific. Growth rate at five degrees or zero point zero or twelve and then the generation time is fifty six hours so it's a little bit more than two hours a day so that the organism takes five degrees to multiply so. If you start a food product after a little bit more than two days you have one multiplication after a little bit more than four days you have. Again. Duplications of the number of or going to him so. There is growth. But it is very slow. You can also collate how much time is needed to increase the level of the microorganism by two locks. So by a factor of hundreds. Is there and one of those you know it is a better general microorganism and often. Two locks is considered as the limit for this organism. It then takes three hundred seventy three hours. And it's good to try to calculate that also to check these calculations. And that means. About sixty. In days. For this organism. To reach this level of. Hundreds. So do locks. If we increase the temperature from five to seven so it's only a very slight increase at a difference between. Putting your refrigerator at five degrees or seven degrees. The generation time goes down by about a factor through so it's a generation time of one day. The time for it to look and grease six hundred sixty six hours and that means that at this. Only seven days so you can see that by only changing two degrees a very slight change in temperature. You reduce the shelf life of a product by almost a factor too. If your refrigerator would be at then of course your refrigerator is not at than high because you have followed these courses in food market eulogy and. You will understand that you need to. Largely cool down your refrigerator. But if your refrigerator would be at ten. Then you have a generation time of only eleven hours so again about a factor to lower your shelf life of your product. Goes down to only three days so you can see a very large impact of only fairly slight changes in the temperature. So to summarize this presentation. Temperature. Affects the growth rate of the microorganism. And it does it. Very largely. It has a very big impact. Of course we should. Prevents temperatures near the optimum growth temperature of the organism. When a thirty seven degrees and so on but that's of course not where we generally store all food products. But even temperatures fluctuations very near to a minimum grow temperature. So in the neighborhood of where we store our food products are going to have a very large effect on the shelf life of products and therefore it's very important to. Bitly control the temperature. In or. Cooling change in our house in order for a cure rate of.",

                "text": "Hello. This clip is about. My major interests and that. Risk factors of cancer. Which factors are positively. And which are infinitely. Related to the occurrence of cancer. Well the main. Respect the folk answer is. Age. As you can see in this graph you can see that the. The. The accumulation of epi genetic or genetic changes over time. Is causing a cancer to. Grove and this grove may take thirty to forty years. So when you're twenty years old your cancer may already start with it's going to be diagnosed when you're fifty or sixty years old and. You can see it from. This graph that. In men for instance you see that the risk is extremely increasing. After a certain age. And in women you also see an increase. After menopause for years. Which means that. Indeed. Age is deep in most important respect for cancer cancer is a disease. Of elderly individuals. Secondly we know from all the biology that has been studied. Over the last decades. That inheritance. Is an important risk factor but only. Among five to ten percent. Of cancer is really. Inherited. Which means it fronts. In the families. You got your. A gene which was mutated. From your mother or father. But it's only five to ten percent. So what happens to the risk. Rest of all cancers. When. Five to ten percent is really inherited. Ninety to ninety five percent. Has to do with our environment. And this is also what we now think we think it's a combination of factors. On one side. It's. Lifestyle. On the other side it's sort of a genetic susceptibility. Maybe to lifestyle factors. Somebody who's. Smoking his whole life. Or drinking has all life doesn't mean that that person is going to get cancer. Think of your grant that. Maybe who who smoked and drank and never got cancer. Or there are also some people who have a healthy lifestyle the whole life through. But still get cancer at certain points in time. There's also something that we can call better luck. Something which is unexplained. Something we might explain in the future. But sometimes you can also say this will never be explained. So these are the main it's emotive looked oriel disease. There are many different types of respect us. And these are the main causes that we've now identified. Smoking. Remains the most important race factor of. Not only lung cancer but different types of cancer. And you see that secondly. An unhealthy diet. And activity. Is a major cause of cancer. Next to that. Chronic infections with the. Popular home of virus or. Have otitis virus. Especially in africa and asia. Are is a major cause of cancer. Hormone related cancer like breast cancer and prostate cancer. Age at which you get your first child. The number of children that you get the whether you take hormone replacement therapy or not. Those are factors which are influencing. Breast and prostate cancer. And as you can see inheritors also explain somewhat. But occupation. Is only among a certain group of people who are really exposed to certain chemicals for instance or to ready ation because of the work. But it's only a small part of what causes cancer in the population at large. Now. Why did we ever think that environmental factors were involved. Well. Mainly because of the. The first steps in epidemiology descriptive of the murals you were where you can first. Look at what's. What we do we see in the distribution of cancer around the world. And here you see the global incidence of call rectal cancer in the world. And you see that. Call rectal cancer is mainly. Important in in europe. In canada. America. In new zealand in australia. But not in africa and asia. Where you look at the distribution of stomach cancer in the world. You see a completely different pattern. Here you see that it's important in asia. It's important in south america. But not so much in europe or in america or canada. So it's a different issue buescher and what does that mean. And what does that mean. If people move from one continent. To the other. Or the other way around what happens. The migrant studies. Those are typical very nice experiments that we don't even need to sit at that or anything like that but we can learn from. Now in the ninety. Forties the end of ninety forty. A lot of people from japan with a very traditional lifestyle moved to the us. And here they took the. Lifestyle from the. Americans over and it very quickly became theirs and. What also became theirs was their kids to type. Here you see that in japan at that time. Coretta cancer. As hartley. Occurring. But in the us. It was one of the main most important. Types of cancers. Now what you see is that the japanese and why. They got the same type of cancer called rectal cancer. In one two generations it was nearly as high as it was in the original. Us population and and. For now that. It's even higher than what's happening in the in the rest of the u.s.. Now for stomach and so it was completely the other way around this at that time point in the one nine hundred s. it was really very frequently occurring in japan. Not so much in the u.s.. But the japanese in hawaii also changed their incidence of stomach cancer towards the lower frequency. In the u.s.. So correct or cancer came up. Stomach cancer came down. Within one two generations now these can be changed in genes. Luckily we don't change that much in our genes. Must be something in the environment. And that's what we've learned from. Then frew all. Other types of studies case control studies covert studies. Randomized controlled trials we now know what are the major. Diet and lifestyle related. Risk factors. And the major one is of weight. It doesn't. Only increase your risk of cardiovascular disease of diabetes but also. Of different types of cancer. It's really de main respected for cancer and. It has everything to do with the. Adipose tissue. And the distribution of the tissue. And we now know that it's especially those with a shaped. We also know that especially the board. There fat which is surrounding the organs to fish are all fat which is important. And a risk factors for cancer are. Partly obesity related. We know that a high intake of energy dense foods is increasing the risk of several types of cancer. We know that a low physical activity associated with a high energy if they intake is associated with a higher risk of cancer. We know that a low intake of vegetables fruits cereal started every fiber. Is related to the risk. Or is decreasing. No. Increasing the risk of several types of cancers. And we know that a high. Intake of red meat. In this is poor beef. Is increasing the risk of colon cancer. And what a lot of people do not seem to know or don't want to know maybe. Is that a high intake of alcohol beverage is increasing the risk of cancer and. For cancer it starts we've already won the last day. Now what could we prevent. As i showed you before. About twenty five percent of all cancers. Are explained by. Diet and lifestyle like also physical inactivity and w c or if i c r are estimating that about twenty to thirty percent of most common types of cancers so that's breast cancer go rectal cancer prostate cancer lung cancer. Could be prevented if we would eat a healthy diet and. If we would be more physically active doable. One would say. So in summary what i wanted to show you is. What are the main. Important risk factors for cancer and. What could we prevent with. Healthy lifestyle. Thank you very much.",

                "text": "Preserve at this are intrinsic fact those. There are components of a food products that inhibit microbial growth and are relevant also for shelf life of food products. We serve at this are substances capable of. And at them. Inhibiting. Or retarding the growth of microorganisms. Or mosque. The evidence of the deterioration. By these. Microorganisms. There are also other ingredients that. Inevitably actions friends antioxidants or in most if i as they are not defined as preservatives. So prefer some surfeit this are really targeted at microorganisms. And they can either. Kill microorganisms and then there are micro be seidel or they can stop the growth of microorganisms and then there are. Micro be static. They prevent the groat. In many food products there are natural preserve of this presence. For instance in milk. There is still active parasitic system who are with parasites together with the use innate. Form a component to this toxic for microbial grote. Also there is a milk present life to simon and that attacks the. Up go to a layer that is the only outside of microorganisms so this really affects the microorganisms. Also in milk there is like the friend that binds. Ira and therefore there is not know. Irene available for the micro going to have to grow and the milk there are antibodies that can also. At that microorganisms. Also in all the natural products like eggs. There are anti microbial systems. For instance there is also lysozyme presence just as a milk. Aphrodite presence that binds the bio within and by that then is again a substance that is needed for some bacteria to grow. Album in presence that. Just as with the lector for in its binding the ira and therefore. Having the microorganisms don't have been available. And also a quite is alcohol excise a very high ph. And of course an ak has a shell. Which also is a structure to prevent. Microorganisms to. Attack the act. So this unnatural preserve for their systems and food products. But we as food technologists also often. At all kind of preservatives to food products. For instance we make use of all kind of organic assets like acetic acid lactic acid prop you want to i said sawbuck i said and ben so i said to inhibit the growth of microorganisms. And certain food products already these type of components are naturally present present because for instance and. Many berries there is sort of as a as a presence. And in certain cases we have for instance for mentor products for electric as it is produced by microorganisms. But also sometimes these compounds. Are added to specific food products. And especially to inhibit yeast molds and as said lawford bacteria are lactic acid. Bacteria. And we need to have enough of these compounds and all these type of products that are quite asset and have a long shelf life like ketchup sources and. Pickles and so on. One. Preservative. Is also sulfites. Sulfides. Just as carbon dioxide. Is dissolved in water. Again make an asset and. Been a trade. To sell and. Within the cell. Then this is shade and. Acidified and there we are off the cell. So it. I said if i stand there of the cell. Again. Lowered a ph. Of the food product. And sulfites we can find and. Several food products and. A very good example is a product of wine in many winds you will see that there is written on the bottle. That sulfide. Is present. It disrupts microbial metabolism. And it's generally subtle nice to see it officiate at the yeast that this producing the oco and based flavors in the wind. Is a little bit less susceptible to the sulphite. But many order microorganisms like for instance acetic acid bacteria that. Make acetic i said was of course not a good taste in wine. Will be reduced. To drawback of. Adding sulfides to a product is that it. Stroy fit them in b.. And therefore the use of. Sulfite and meat products. Is in many cases prohibited. And therefore in many. Meat products are not a component this adults which is nitrite nitride as used in those meat products and especially and. Slices of meat and. Specifically to targets that in a bit. Inhibition of the growth of custody in both the line and. This might in certain cases survive in in the meat products. And then. Is able to produce a toxin. The drawback of this nitrite is that it can. Together with secondary a mind's form. Need to some minds and. That those components are thought to be potentially causing the genic. However if we add also a school of assets. That fit them in c.. Then we can and have of this reaction so if we adds both nitrate. And fit them in c. to a food product. We can have the advantage of the inhibition of the growth of course city in both the lyneham. But we don't get these natural so many forms. Of course we want. In many food products to have a kind of natural. Preservatives systems. Because chemical preservatives like sulfite and nitrite they are perceived. Unnatural. So there is a real quest for natural alternatives. And one example are for instance. Back to a sense that our compounds that are formed by lactic acid bacteria are for example nice and that inhibits bacteria. And also essential oils. So old from plants like for instance. Garlic. Oil or mistletoe they inhibit the growth of the area. However they also generally have a strong. Based on a strong odor. So to summarize this presentation. There are many types of preservatives present. There is a trans to go more to clean label. And to natural preserve at this. What we tried to do is with these preservative to start we want to stop microbial growth so that there are. Micro be static. And for that so we often need to make use of these preservatives together with other preservative. Measures.",

                "text": "What are activity and relative humidity are important factors to affect the microbial groat water activity is an intrinsic factor so it's a characteristic of a food product. Relative humidity is an extra encik factor it's practice to cause the an environment of the food products. And boats. Are influencing microbial growth. And they're also related to each other whatever activity is defined as a measure of the free water available. As a fraction of the water in a food product is bound to the food. But there is also freely available water and the water activity. Is a characteristic of this. And it's defined as the partial fabre pressure. Of foods. At a certain temperature. Divided by the. Faber pressure of pure water. At that temperature. And if the food product is in a collaboration with its environment. This water activity is equal to the relative humidity of the food product. The relative humidities of the next pressed and percentage should ever we have to define this. By hundreds. To microorganisms. Have a certain tendency to be able to grow at certain water activities. And supply them or not as an organism that can grow as a minimal water up to fifty of point one six. So it can grow only between point one six what an activity and one or two microorganisms can support. Also lower water activities or more drag on the shins. And especially staphylococcus aureus can grow. Even at what activity you have point eight six. And there are. How felix was sold living but the area that can even support. Low water activities. You can see that yeast. Can grow at a little bit more. Low water activities done in general to bacteria and especially seahorse our home users can grow at fairly low water activities. And also molds are able to grow at more dry conditions. And especially see it will meet us. Is an organism that can grow at. Furry low water activities. So we have zero. Microorganisms they can grow and dry foods. And fungi like i specialise. Is an example. You have also organisms that are specifically. Possible philip showed a light. Like high. Osmolarity and. Especially sugar. Is increasing the or small pressure of a food products and francis' products like. Jam staff a lot of sugar and yeast like see who is able to spoil such a product. There are also organisms that. Like salt so they are how low tolerance. They are able to grow and. Salty products and staphylococcus always is able to grow. And cook meat products for a lot of salt as adults. So they are tolerant to this solves but. Other microorganisms are really how to feel like they are. Obligates they need to have this. This salt. vailable. And the example of this is people your by him when he did this. That is able to grow in coastal waters and therefore. Is often present in. Fish and shellfish. And streams francis. So if you have seen the limits of microbes growing in these foods. We can also look at the. Specific what activities that we can find and foods. Microorganisms are not able to grow in food products with water activities of. Point six and lower and. Again these that often have very low water activities and therefore these products will never spoiled by. Microbial. Reactions by the growing of yeast all molds. However. Honey. And jam. Had to have higher water activities and in certain cases the geest and molds can grow on these type of food products. And therefore it's good if your. Have opened your jam for insist. To stored up afterwards in the refrigerator. But if we go further with higher water activity food products like fermented sources just cheese or. Fresh meat. Those type of food products. They have water activities for also all kinds of yeast molds but also bacteria. Are able to grow. So we can reduce the water activity of a food. What if by adding soul units. And if we add salt to do. To a food product. We can reduce the water activity. And if for instance we want to limit the growth of saddam on us and meat products as an example. We need to reduce the water to fifty two point one six. And then we can see that in order to achieve. Absence of growth of certain among us in this product. We need to add. About ninety grams of salt per liter. So that means that we have to add nine percent. Or salts to a food product. And that's a huge amount of salt. The taste of that product will be comparable to the saltiness of a rock for cheese. So in order to reduce the water activity with only one compounds you generally need a huge amount. We can also reduce this water activity by adding water soul you'd like for instance sugar. However we can see in this graph that if we add sugar water activity or using a factor is even lower than. By adding of salt. And in order to get through. Water at their fifty or forty nine six. We need to add. Nine hundred grams of sugar. In one liter of water. So it's again. A huge amount of salt. That is needed to limit the growth of sodam on ice. Which was the most sensitive. Microorganism to this compound. So not a way to reduce the water up to fifty years by removing water. We can remove water by drying or by smoking. But they're not a possibility it's also freezing because if water is frozen. Then it becomes ice and. It's not free water it's bongs water again and therefore also freezing reduces the water activity. And we can see if we lower the temperature in our freezer. We've got a lower activity and an order to get to this. What are thirty of point nine six. We need to temperature of about minus six degrees. And with that's we can limit the growth of saddam on us. Of course we should realise. That also to lower temperature reduces the growth of the organism. But also. This low water activity lowering effect. Has an impact on the growth of this organism. So often. We make use of a combined. Application of. Reserve reduction of this water activity. In many cases for instance in sausages. We apply several processes there is first a drying stage and also resulting stay showboats. Have an effect on the water activity of the product. But if we reduce this water activity we should realize that if there is no growth of the organism. Generally the conditions are such in those dry conditions that your going to who can survive it will not be inactive feta due to these conditions. It simply stopped. Its growth but it keeps a life. So we can see and. This graph of reaction rate of all kind of. Spoilage reactions and. Bacteria. Will grow as fairly high water at their fifty's. Yeast and. Fringe i can grow at a little bit lower activities. But at even lower worth if these we have no spoilage. Of bacteria. However there are other. Spoilers reactions that can occur. So these products are not have do not have an infinity shelf life. And products. Like for instance chocolate or chicle powder or milk powder. They still can spoil nuts. Due to the growth of bacteria. But for instance due to. Lippitt oxidation. We should also be aware of pitfalls. Because there can be local changes in the water activity of a foot product. If you frances have a dry ice or such and it is in a packaging and. The temperature is changing. In this package. For instance due to the exposure to light. Then whatever. This product can warm up a little bit and what are going to federate and then there can be condensation on the surface of the packaging material and we get water droplets and these water droplets can fall on our products and on locally. We can get a very high water activity. And on those locations. I can be of a terrible growth and to even make it more severe but theory out or yeast. Then can grow on that location but by. Growing they produce again. Even more water. And that makes that. Reactions can even go further and quicker. So there is a second preservation pitfall and the this product reformulation. Due to health reasons we want. In many products to remove the amount of sugar and we want to remove the biggest amount of salt because sugar. Gives us too much energy and salt is not good for our blood pressure. But by reducing sugar and reducing salt. Of course we also take away. Limits that stop or bacterial growth. And there is a real life example what i was a hazelnut conserve that was in the process and all process heated for ten minutes at ninety degrees. And like or syrup was added. Of course to give it this. Sweet taste. But also to reduce the water activity. In order to reduce the amount of energy in this food product. They changed the glucose are up to aspartame and that to do the same process. So what would the effect now be. The problem of. This new product formulation was that aspartame does not reduce the water up to fifty lighted like or syrup that. And the hasten the preparation was a low acid foods it had a little bit lower ph the neutral but still sufficient. Lehi focus it in borderline to be able to grow in this product. And also to ninety minutes. The ninety degrees ten minutes heating process was not sufficient to inactivate clostridium both a line and so therefore this organism goods. Could grow in this product and produce toxin. So the effect of this product formulation although. The objective was to reduce the energy. Exposure in this product. Yet fact was that. Twenty seven people got sick. Due to this. Eating this product and one person died. So this is definitely a pitfall. So to summarise what activity is already a very and chance method to priest. Foods. It can be used it can be done by adding salt. By adding sugar by drying a food product or by freezing a food product. But we have to be aware of the pitfalls of course that a can be evaporation. Can be condensation so we can get local. Changes in our water activity which is a very very important factor and. Different soul use that we do adds have a very different effect on the water activity in our food products.",

                "text": "Today the lecture is about redux potential and gas atmosphere. Spoilage of food going to good you two microbial growth and microbial growth is influenced amongst all of us by. Intrinsic an extra insect fact us. Intrinsic factors. Are characteristics of the food products and a reader to potential is a characteristic of a foot product and. Extrinsic factors are the and violent of the food products and. Grass atmosphere is the environment of the food product. But to read it for tension and the guys at bushehr who influence each other. The reader potential. Is the tendency of a medium to accept or donate. Electrons. Redux reactions occur by and oxidants that's together with a proton and some electrons. Is a nickel every i'm with the reductions. And the medium which is totally saturated with air. Has a high rate of potential. Of the order of fear hunt for hundreds. Millivolts. Oxygen from the atmosphere can act as an electron except yielding reactive substances. And also yielding. For if we consume certain components. A lot of energy. Except form. Having this. High energy yield. Also these components result. These reactions result and. Reactive oxygen species and. Hydrogen parasite and super oxide. Are formed by oxygen. And that are talks of components that need to be broken down. So our overall organisms get a lot of energy. By making use of oxidative force for the station and. By making it by using this oxygen. But the. Two components that are forms. Need to be broken down by and times. That are present in an aerobic microorganisms. And they are called super oxide this mutation. And cattle ace. Anaerobic microorganisms. Do not have one of these and symes or either of these and times. And therefore they cannot grow at a high rate of four ten chills and the presence of oxygen. So different types of my. We're going to do exist. You have microorganisms to obligate. Air old microorganisms that really need oxygen for their growth and an example as bacillus. So microorganisms are micro era filler. They require to have a little bit of oxygen but they don't like high oxygen concentration so. The normal atmospheric. Oxygen concentration is a little bit too high for them and example is competent doctor. You also have. Facultative anaerobic microorganisms. Don't do not require oxygen. But if oxygen is presidents they grow better. Because they can get a lot of energy then. Out of the substrate. You also have arrows dollar and anaerobic microorganisms. They grow. Equally well in the presence and in the absence. And the absence of oxygen. And the example an example like that i said bacteria. But organisms that do not have one of these and as i'm still breakdown these toxic compounds do not tolerate oxygen and are killed by the presence of oxygen. And those organisms are called. Obligate anaerobic microorganisms. And an example is clostridium both the line and. So. Different microorganisms have different characteristics. Concerning our obesity or anaerobic city and food products that can be more or less an anaerobic or aerobic and. Products that do not have a lot of oxygen or have a negative friedrichs potential. And example saw for instance whole grain wheat and. Meat and there are other food products that have a very aerobic and vitamins and they have a positive rate of potential and examples of spinach. Lemon. And pierce. So this is very important factor for this rate of potential. But there are also a lot of factors influencing the read it for pencil and examples are processing like for instance milling or grinding. If we grind to food products. Then we. There is a better access to oxygen and we got a higher rate export than still. So meat. Have a whole piece of meat as a high rate a very low rate of potential however if we are going to run this meat. Then we get a higher. Predicts potential. So a steak has a low rated for ten fold but. If we make hamburger meat out of it. It's got a higher rate of potential. So processing has an effect on there is potential but also the ph. Has an effect on the reader's potential that we can see an unevidenced equation. In the nancy question we can see that the readers for tensional is determined by the by the temperature. Body and mind of oxidant the amount of rate of turns but also by the parasite concentration about a proton concentration. So if we have more acid food products that concentration is higher and we got a higher rate of potential. And that is one of the reasons why. The lemon and. Beer also have a very high rate of potential. Ok units available there. But that are also. I said food products and for that but the. Low ph. Results in a higher rate of potential but the third factor. That is of relevance. Is microbial grote. If microorganisms do grow. They consume. Oxygen. And sometimes they produce reductions like hydrogen and. By deaths they lowered to readers for tensile. Of the foods. Carbon dioxide is also a very relevant factor in the gas atmosphere. Because carbon dioxide. To get over the water and. This all of the water face and there. Transform to carbonic acid. And this couple i said bartley this is shade and. By carbonate. And a proton and. By this process. We can lower the. B.h. of the food products. And secondly this gobble and i guess it is also a weak asset. And can have a weak asset effect on the material growth by since this component can and thought about here or sell and then this is shared within the pill cell. And then. Acidifying the interior. So. Carbon dioxide. Has and in the gas face has and. And the microbial effect. Most sensitive to this effect are malts and x.. Oxidative gram negative bacteria and. Gram positive. And yeasts are more resistant to discover and dioxide. This effect of carbon dioxide. Works best in conditions where there is also oxygen present and. Also it works better at lower temperatures. Because at lower temperatures carbon dioxide dissolves better and water. You have higher. Govern dioxide concentration of carbon i said concentration in the water face and therefore. At lower temperatures. It even works better. So these type of processes are used in food preservation and an example of this is fake and packaging. In figure and packaging we exclude all the air from the package so for food products. Of course if then. This product is stuart's. The product itself and also the microorganisms present there can still respond or a little bit and. If there was a little bit of oxygen present still consume that oxygen. And also. During that respiration they can also produce a little bit of carbon dioxide so. The gas atmosphere can change a little bit in that package. But. That works. Positively because oxygen is consumed and got on the outside is going up so it's even more another thing for the growth of the bacteria. And this type of packaging is used for cook meats fish and prepared salads. But as you can already see a little bit on the picture. The color of the meat becomes a little bit gray and or sometimes a little bit. Because there is no oxygen present and. Myoglobin. And the himachal being that it's in the meat and giving it is rather color. Will reduce throughout the color because if there is no oxygen present. These components will not have any more direct color. And for that reason. In many cases we will store meats not on the fake him. But on the. Modified atmosphere packaging. And modified atmosphere packaging and here. You can see an example of modify that most are packaging. So it's much more. Air face. Presence as a faker and packaging. But here it's not the normal atmospheric air. In this air. Would in this package they have increased. Dioxide concentration and they have decreased. The oxygen concentration. But not those zero there is still. Oxygen present to keep. To keep the red color of the meat. But by reducing the oxygen. We can and have it a little bit. Growth of the aerobic microorganisms but especially by increasing the carbon dioxide concentration. We can inhibit the growth of many organisms. So examples of these type of processes are. Bread and meat. But also of course in this package the atmosphere might change during storage. Because there is respiration of the product itself or the cells of the meat. Still can continue to rest by or a little bit. Furthermore there might be microorganisms present that also respond to a little bit. But we should realize also that the plastic packaging material is also a little bit permeable to gaza so. During time there will also be an extension of gas. With the environment. But this happens especially if we open the package. Then of course it will be gone in the normal atmospheric air. In or around all meat. For that reason and. Many cases for big book transport. We make use of an even more advanced process of controlled. Atmosphere packaging. That is used in. Frances and broken danus and big ships that. Transport fruits. There. The atmosphere is also changed but it's not only changed for joining time it's also measured and if it's. The v.a. i think the composition of the air is brought back to the target's value. So the atmosphere a skeptic constant so even if there is respiration of the product or if there i think for the outside the environments. The concentration of the carbon dioxide and oxygen. Is controlled at a fixed value. So to summarise both oxygen and carbon dioxide have a big influence on which microorganisms can grow and how fast they can grow. And by changing the gases atmosphere. We can extend the shelf life of many food products.",

                "text": "This lecture will be about. Sources of contamination. And describe. Different types of microorganisms. And our quantum a nation root. Microorganisms are organisms on the micro meter scale and a micro meter is one thousandth of a millimeter. So that's very small and therefore. We also need a microscope to make. Microorganisms visible. But tyria. Have to size of about one micro meter and they are sometimes in a round shape. Which is called a cork or oxide. And sometimes they do. Live in groups of two then they're called to blow corks. Some type of microorganisms do live in. Strains of these different cox. Cox i. And they're called stop the cork site and. In certain cases they live in great blood structures. And then they are called stuff a cork. Not all microorganisms are around some of them. Also have a rod shape so then they are a little bit longer than that they'll have us with and. These rocks sometimes have also flagellate that are some sort of tails. And the microorganisms use these sometimes to move and. In certain cases to attach to a certain surface. Some of the these routes. Also have an endo spore. In them. And then they can turn into sports and sports are survival cup shoes that. Can survive. Severe conditions. So apart from these books i and rots. There are also other shapes of microorganisms like food brioche. And spirit. Certain microorganisms. Are. Of bigger size and. That our friends as yeast use are about five to ten pounds bigger than. Bacteria. Deficit's of ten. Micro meet us and used to often grow by budding. So they get a little bit of a daughter cell which is. At the beginning smaller. And then. And time is growing at a certain moment get to the same size. And then the two cells do separate and. The organism remains as a uni cell or. Microorganism. But most. In many cases. Do grow as. Multicellular organisms have the same size of about ten micro metres but they grow in big structures so a lot of cells together. And then and certain cases even can make structures that. Also become physical. In certain cases you can for instance on bratz or on fruits. See. Really the filament this moves being present. And that's because they have formed. These big structures. Far is this. Are again. Much smaller than bacteria and they're about forty times smaller than cook's eye and therefore size of about twenty five nanometers so they are even too small to be seen with a light microscope and. You even need to an electron microscope to make them fishable. Strictly speaking. Viruses are no microorganisms because strictly speaking there are no life. Because they need the hosts to multiply. And they don't have their own metabolic them to make use of the metropolitan. Of their host cell. So they have no they cannot. Multiply. In food products that aren't going to grow in foods they need a host cell and. For instance a plant or a human or an animal to to multiply. However they are a very major. Course of food borne disease so although. Maybe there are not defined as life. They are fairly relevant because they can make us. Ill. So microorganisms. Are everywhere. And in this picture. You can see animals fish. Humans plants and birds so living subjects that contain microorganisms. In their intestines on the skin. These organisms they eat. So. Animals they eat animal feed. We as human beings we eat. Products of animal origin and of plant origin and. By deaths we are get contaminated. Then after eating. We produce faces and. Friends all faces can go to the water or the faces of farm animals can go to the soil. And in that way. All these structures. Can contaminate the. And consume certain parts of the other us and so we got to contamination pathways. And as you can see here in this graph. These condemnation pathways are rather complex. And that is relevant to realize because that means that by doing simply one thing. Generally you cannot solve the contamination of food products. We. Apart from having already this difficult structure you have also firm and. Air that our importance going to my nation roots of. All these different places. And therefore by simply doing one thing. We cannot prevent contamination. We have to look at it from different angles and look at all these confirmation routes. To investigate and. Control or microbial. Contamination. So microorganisms are everywhere. But bass backing. That this is his hypothesis. He said. Microorganisms. Are everywhere. But the environment selects. And that's the next step. Microorganisms are there. But they need a suitable and violence to live and that ecological niche. And they need resources they need. Nutrients to grow and. The conditions. Around them need to be such that they can grow for instance to be a short attention. Dump what you need to be such that the microorganism can grow. So they need something to eat. And their environment need to be good for them to be able to grow. So that difficult flora of a certain and firemen's which can be a food product or. An animal or it or and test and. The typical. Flora. In such a place. Will be often found. It will often be the same type of micro going to that will be found because the organism that is there has competitors vantage. It is there. But also. It gets its nutrients there and the environment is such that it's going very well. Grow so to summarise microorganisms. Can be everywhere and they will be everywhere. So there will be many different organisms that can possibly contaminate our food so that is one angle. They can be there. A lot of them can be there. But it's to environment that selects and. That will select which of the microorganisms. Will grow faster because it's the most suited to this specific environment.",

                "text": "This lecture will be about nutrients and structure. For microbial grote. Intrinsic factors are had that are the characteristics of a food products. Are very important and nutrients and structures. Are intrinsic factors that we are going to discuss and deflection. Microorganisms. Are just like human beings. Organisms and they have a myth ability and. They have got to believe him. And they have an ability. They have all kind of metabolic roots to degrade. All kind of carbon and energy sources to generate the precursors to make new cells. And also to generate energy. And they also have an ability to oak on of metabolic roots. For the bios and bases of older. Compounds in their cells. Like d.n.a. r.n.a. etc. So there needs to consume. Just like human beings there needs to consume nutrients. So mostly. Microorganisms are gay mohi to a trough that means that they need to have preforms. Molecules from down violence so they need to have nutrients and to find this in their environment. And for that. They have and symes. That are important in the myth ability to help transform. All kind of substrate from the food. Into products. And that are amenable lights that the microorganisms. Do make. So or food. Is also food for microorganisms. And food. Contains in many cases carbon and a key sources like friends of starch and luggage and. Like those and glucose. And in food there is also. There are often proteins peptides and amino acids that. Supply again. And he and. Nitrogen sources. Often there are limits and free fatty acids in foods that. Again supply carbon. And then she. Also in foods there are spore elements like our own and mention ease and all the matter. Needs the spore elements so. Human beings but also. Microorganisms. And there are fighting men's present and certain food products. Like for instance fit them in b.. And so. Microorganisms specifically need specific outfight immense. And also. Water is important for the growth of the microorganisms. Just as it is for human beings. So one way to influence. But tiriel groat. Is to protect the microorganisms to get students nutrients and. In certain cases for insist there are a nature. Physical barriers and a good example. For instance is the shell of this not. Would end as not. There is something. Very nice to eat. For human beings. But also for microorganisms. But it's difficult to get there. A little bit for human beings. But also specifically for microorganisms to get in there. So there are a lot of micro micro molecules doesn't reset. The resist. To make the product more resistant to the gradation. The same as for instance the peel. Of a fruit. And also around meat. There can be effect protection. And we as human also have a skin. And it protects all sort of microorganisms to directly attack our blots. So these. These shelves and. These skins. And these peels. They hinder the growth of microorganisms. Because there is only surfaces often lack of water. So there are generally dry. They cannot connect to the nutrients that are in there. And they are also not protected against the environment there is often for instance. You fate. Radiation. There is desiccation so drying due to the fact that there are only surfaces. For these anti-microbial barriers help to make a longer shelf life of a food products. And there is a big difference between. Several groups of microorganisms francis' more steak can easily degrade. These type of anti microbial structures and. They are made to for instance breakdown that lease of plants and so on sort of have all kind of. Ends i'm still attacked. These micro molecules. Can break them down. Can make use of that and been a trait of these type of food products. But our other microorganisms like for us electric as. Bacteria. They are you could say a little bit lazy. And they are adapted to food products that are very rich in nutrients. So they only grow on. Products where they can easily have access to all. Nutrients that are available. So to break down. All these barriers there are all kinds of different types of. And sometimes. And there are for instance back teens. There are starch lippert some proteins that need to be broken down. And microorganisms. Have all kind of and times to break this down. Back to late take and times. A military. And sometimes liberal addict and sam's and proto illiterate and sometimes the back to later and times are important to break down. The outer surface of the fruit and. An example organism is given here. And that. Then degrades to stretch out a structure of the fruit. And then releases the nutrients. Making it available for growth of the organism itself but also many other organisms. I'm going to take. And the times that degrade starch and that. Then releases. Sugar. Parts that can be consumed by a specialist but also by all the microorganisms. Liberal or take. And sam's release fatty acids that often leads to rancidity. And this can also be used as substrate for microorganisms. And proto your logic. And sam's. Breakdown proteins and. In certain cases it can then go relate these proteins. It releases again. Nutrients and microorganisms are been able to make use of these nutrients and grow on that. So there are. We have the fruits which are a lot of a difficult to degrade but we also have meat. And meat in principle is the same as our skin but there are good skin so it's already wet. The blood is available for the microorganisms. So even the lazy microorganisms can directly attack such. Food products. Because everything is available it's a very good environment. Until you can see. In a graph what is happening then. The microorganisms are lazy they start with the most easy component so we see that. First glucose is broken down. And the organism. Is. Continue to grow. After the glucose is broken down. The next. Compounds. As the root causes finishes like that i said. That is also quite easy to get an a-z. and carbon dioxide. Carbon from. And then. If that is finished. The organism organisms start to break down creating and if that is finished they start with other proteins and. Glucose is transferred to do water and c o two so that it's not easy to appreciate. And you cannot taste or smell that. Also like the gas that will be transferred to c o two and water. But as soon as. Protein type. Structures are broken down. Often. Nitrogen. And so for the type of compounds. Are produced. And so we can generally smell. That's the product is spoiled. So nutrients and barriers and preservation. Are important and. We have to realize of course that food is a food. But as a technologist we want. How can we change that. And we can sometimes do that by changing by changing the nutrients available by increasing or decreasing the nutrients available. Or we can do that by processing. By introducing or removing barriers in our food products. So the first application is increasing the nutrients. In many cases. We produce fermented foods and. Lactic acid bacteria are often fermented foods they make them as it gives them a better taste a longer shelf life. However like i mentioned before like i said bacteria. Are a little bit lazy organisms and they need a lot of nutrients available for growth. And they friends also have a requirement for high amounts of munger nice. So in for mental sausages. Often the mention is not sufficiently available. And they do not grow that fast. However if we add also spices to these sausages that yes of course are good taste but secondly we then. Also give them or mention his and due to the amount of mention if they can grow faster. More quickly. From an. Food products so we have more quickly. Food products with sufficient. Acidity. To make it a longer shelf life. And give it a better safety. Another way is to introduce new barrios and an example of this is for instance butter. Butter is a water and oil in most emotion. So we have for a small water droplets. Within the oil and. By having this structure. We can. Prevents microbial spoilage to occur because if microorganisms are in these water droplets. They can grow. A couple of times they can multiply a couple of times but at a certain moments the nutrients are limited and. They have no contact with the other water droplets. And therefore do not get sufficient. Additional nutrients and. There is a barrier against the microbial spoilage. And this is called. Compartmentalisation. So the cells are separated by the nutrients. By making fairly small. Water droplets. So this is a process where we can make use of an additional barrier to improve the shelf life of a food product. So to summarise. Nutrients and barriers. Are important. Intrinsic fact us. For microbial grote. Foods contain nutrients that. A low microbial grote. However if there are in fact barriers to microorganisms cannot attack. These nutrients. And therefore these various can delay. The spoilage. In certain specific cases microbial and sometimes can degrade. These various and then release the nutrients.",

                "text": "This like there is about growth going to take some factors influencing grote. Food products can spoil due to microbial growth organisms need to be there but they also need to grow to reach a spoilage level. And this lecture will be. About factors influencing this grote. If we investigate. Microbial groat. We often make a road girl for we've bought a luxury item of the number of micro-organisms against time. First the market organiser need to adapt to the food product and they are on a like face. Then they will start to grow exponentially. Then. At a certain moment to deteriorate. There and violence and they will reach a special area face. After which they even. Might decrease in a dead face. However for microbial spoilage of food. The sportage level is generally much below. The place where the stationary phase is reached. And therefore the maximum shelf life is largely before the stationary face. So this is a. Microbial growth girth. Describing the development of the number of organisms. As function of time. For spoilage. The like face an exponential face are the most important and we are now going to investigate this. Exponential face of. Microbial drought. And for that. We are going to look more in detail how microorganisms do grow. If a microorganism is well adapted to its environment it ices nutrients the environment is such that it can grow the temperature ph and so on. It all starts to multiply. And it generally divides. At approximately constant time intervals. Which is called. The generation time. That is comparable to human beings in principle we could multiply ourselves. After about fifteen years. So we have about a generation time. Or fifteen years. However microorganisms. Go much faster they have a generation time. Of more in the neighborhood of fifteen minutes. So after one generation time. Or doubling time. We get to the next generation. So at time you see. Row. We have. Generation zero we have one cell. The number of cell phone is due to the power. Zero. So we have one cell. But after. If the generation time is twenty minutes. After twenty minutes. We have a first generation. The cells. Have divided and we have two cells. To have one generation to to the power one is equal to two cells. Again. After twenty minutes. So we are now at forty minutes. We have generation two. Again. The number of cells divides we have to sell state now become. Four cells. So it's due to the power to four cells. After one hour. And third or third generation. So again. You have four cells that if i do get eight cells so we are a generation three to two by what three is. Eight cells. And this continues. And then. If we would have one whole working day. So after eight hours. If the generation time was twenty minutes. We have twenty four generations. And that means that we have to do to power twenty four cells. Which is one point seven ten to the power seven cells. So you can see that. If the conditions are suitable. If we started one cell. After one working day. We can get to one point seven ten to the power seven hundred so that is more than ten million cells. Can be created. And that was about the spoilage level of a food product so. If the conditions are appropriate. Would in one day we can get from one cell to the spoiler's level of a food product. So that shows that. Exponential growth of. Microorganisms. Will occur. If you put this in a graph. And we do that on a linear scale. It seems that in the beginning there is no growth. If we have one cell and two and four and eight and so on until we get to that those done million if we plot that. It seems that there is no increase here. And that's why microbiologist. Often use an logarithmic scale. And if you plot. The same results on a log rhythmic scale. You will see that we start at a certain level and. It increases linearly. So we see here the equation. Yes and at a certain time. Equals or initial level. Multiplied by two to the power. And as the number of generations. And the number of generations is the time divided by the generation time. So this curve. Grows exponentially and. We plot. This therefore. Logarithmically. And if we plotted logarithmically we got as equation the local rhythm of the number of cells. Equal the local rhythm of the number of cells at time zero. Plus the lower end of two divided by the generation time multiplied by the time. And this is a straight line. Describing the microbial grote. So these graphs are made would sell us an initial level of five c. if use. And a regeneration time. Of twenty minutes. This is good. To try yourself in excel. To see if you can reproduce these type of curves. So mark or just have two ways of presenting these. Growth goes and. You could compare that a little bit with two religions some. Of people will work always on logarithm of ten scale and all the people work with the natural logarithm skill. So we can describe these. Microorganism growth by the ten logarithm. And that case. We see we go from ten to the zero differences to ten to the seventh and. The growth rate. Ok in this case is that over and above to defy that by the generation time. And you can see here the equation describing this. So this is you could say. One religion. The other religion is people that say. We have to make use of the natural already. And the natural go to mass a little bit of a different scale. In that case if we put the same data. And the slope of this line. Now as this specific growth rate new. And that is the longer in a. Of to the natural order of two divided by the generation time so here it is than logarithm. Here it's the natural already. The equation is exactly the same as for the bending over and. However the scale is different and therefore the slope. Which is here. K. and the slope here which is mew. Are different and they differ by a factor of two point three. So it is relevant. That there is a difference between the two. I do not specifically have a preference for one of these two religions. You have to know that. They both exist and you have to carefully look. If you read scientific articles or if you see. Experimental results. Which of the two have been used. So pay attention to the units. And the former last and. If we have that it is graph of the lower animals and a function of time that we have seen before in this lecture. You can look back. And you can see that they are the exponential face and i did write. Mew. As the slope. And that case that was not correct. Made their own error because in this case if the. Bend logarithm is used. This is not the specific growth rate. But it is the growth rate and. Look per hour and knobs and. Natural logarithm per hour. So growth kinetics. Is the study of the increase of the cell number. As function of time. We want to know. All kind of factors that influence this growth rate we want to investigate the kinetics. And in this case we assure him that mark microorganism is already. Well adapted to a food product and at the lack of time is zero. And only half as equation for growth is the logarithm of the number of organisms is the initial level. Plus the specific growth rate. Multiplied by the time. This equation can help us to describe the shelf life of a foot product because if we know. The level. World of microorganisms will spoil the food product. If we know. Or initial contaminants. We can calculate the time that the products. Will have a shelf life. If we know. A specific growth rate. And that we can determine by rearranging this equation. The shelf life. Equal slogan of of and t. minus the lower animals and zero. Divided by a specific growth rate. So it's an equation going to help us to determine the shelf life. But it can give us also to think about how can we improve. Or shelf life. So an equation. Is not something magic. It is going to really help us to do something. And that is now my question. How can we make the shelf life longer. So how can we make the shells live longer. That we can do. By either. Increase. What is above the line or. We can decrease what is below the line. So we can either increase the. Nominator and. That means that we can do that by for instance decreasing the initial level. And that way we can make this number bigger. And then we can get a better shelf life so by better hygiene. We can have. Of course a longer shelf life. But another way is to decrease the. Nominator and. By doing that. That means that we decrease the growth rate if we get slower. Roads. Also we can increase the shelf life. So we can determine different growth scenarios and. For this. We are going to look at the next sample where we have an initial level of thousand cells per milliliter. We have no like fish. We have a generation time of eighteen minutes and. We assume that the food product is spoiled at ten to the savants self's. And then my second question is what has no more effect on the maximum spoilage. At the maximum time that the product. Is suitable. We can't. I don't recall the initial level so assume that we reduce the level four thousand cells. But ninety nine percent so. We have largely improved our hygiene to ten cells for me liter or. Would a shelf life be longer. If we have double generation time so not. Eighteen minutes but thirty six minutes. So which of the two. Will have the biggest effect on my shelf life. So of course it's difficult to do by only getting this information to determine what the response to this question is you really have to calculate that. And that is done on the next flight. We have here or limits are ten to the seven cells on the food product despoiled. We have a baseline condition where we start at ten to the third bacteria per milliliter. So on a log scale that a stent three. And we have a generation time of eighteen minutes. And then we can calculate that you reach the. Spoilage level. After four hours. If now we have our first scenario where we diminish the number of the initial. Number by two then. So by ninety nine percent we go down to looks. We have of course the same generation time so the slope is the same. And then we reach our spoilage level after six hours. So the other scenario. One the second scenario. We have to same initial level but we have a specific growth rate which is lower or a generation time which is longer. So the slope of the line is half. And we have a generation time not of. Eighty minutes but. Thirty six minutes. Then we get this line. And we get a shelf life of. Eight hours. So the response to the question is that by decreasing the growth rate or increasing the generation time. In this case we get a longer shelf life. So this growth rate. Is an important factor determine order to determine our shelf life. And fortunately there are a huge amount of ways to reduce the growth rate and that are all tools that us food technologists we have to improve the shelf life. And the factors that we can investigate. Have different sources. There are. Intrinsic fact us that. Influence the specific growth rate. And those invented factors are the physical democrat problem of the food. And that offer insists the presence of nutrients. The ph. The water activity. And the preservatives that are present. So that are all. Characteristics of the food product. But not only. The food product itself to influence the pacific growth rate. Also the an environment of the food products the extrinsic fact just to have an influence on the growth of the microorganisms. And that our friends is the temperature. The relative humidity and the gas composition. Around the food product. So those are not the characteristics of the food product itself. But that is how we store food products. So. That is the second group. Of factors that influence our growth rates. The third group. Are the implicit fact us. What are the properties. Specifically of the micro organ. For instance it makes a mistress if a growth rate. Interactions between microorganisms. Or succession and time. Of different groups of microorganisms. So we have the practices of the food product. The characteristics of the environment. And the characteristics of the microorganisms. But the fourth one. That is. We all self are human do humans that are processing the foods or. We as consumers in our kitchen. We are doing processing. And by doing that we change the food. And the environment and the microorganisms. And that art affords factors that do influence the growth rate. We do processing for instance to preserve the food we best rise to food to eat eradicate the foods we eat at a soul to the food and. We do all kind of processing. To get or decide products for instance. We slice off food products. Back to food products. So this is the human behavior that we do either in the food industry or as consumers. At home. So to summarize the shelf life of a food product is important to do. To optimize. And the shelf life as it is determined by the initial quantum anation but even more largely by the growth rate of the microorganism. And the growth rate of the microorganisms we can influence with a huge amount of factors and that gives us all kind of tools to work on the shelf life of our food.",

                "text": "This lecture will be about. Sources of contamination. And describe. Different types of microorganisms. And our quantum a nation root. Microorganisms are organisms on the micro meter scale and a micro meter is one thousandth of a millimeter. So that's very small and therefore. We also need a microscope to make. Microorganisms visible. But tyria. Have to size of about one micro meter and they are sometimes in a round shape. Which is called a cork or oxide. And sometimes they do. Live in groups of two then they're called to blow corks. Some type of microorganisms do live in. Strains of these different cox. Cox i. And they're called stop the cork site and. In certain cases they live in great blood structures. And then they are called stuff a cork. Not all microorganisms are around some of them. Also have a rod shape so then they are a little bit longer than that they'll have us with and. These rocks sometimes have also flagellate that are some sort of tails. And the microorganisms use these sometimes to move and. In certain cases to attach to a certain surface. Some of the these routes. Also have an endo spore. In them. And then they can turn into sports and sports are survival cup shoes that. Can survive. Severe conditions. So apart from these books i and rots. There are also other shapes of microorganisms like food brioche. And spirit. Certain microorganisms. Are. Of bigger size and. That our friends as yeast use are about five to ten pounds bigger than. Bacteria. Deficit's of ten. Micro meet us and used to often grow by budding. So they get a little bit of a daughter cell which is. At the beginning smaller. And then. And time is growing at a certain moment get to the same size. And then the two cells do separate and. The organism remains as a uni cell or. Microorganism. But most. In many cases. Do grow as. Multicellular organisms have the same size of about ten micro metres but they grow in big structures so a lot of cells together. And then and certain cases even can make structures that. Also become physical. In certain cases you can for instance on bratz or on fruits. See. Really the filament this moves being present. And that's because they have formed. These big structures. Far is this. Are again. Much smaller than bacteria and they're about forty times smaller than cook's eye and therefore size of about twenty five nanometers so they are even too small to be seen with a light microscope and. You even need to an electron microscope to make them fishable. Strictly speaking. Viruses are no microorganisms because strictly speaking there are no life. Because they need the hosts to multiply. And they don't have their own metabolic them to make use of the metropolitan. Of their host cell. So they have no they cannot. Multiply. In food products that aren't going to grow in foods they need a host cell and. For instance a plant or a human or an animal to to multiply. However they are a very major. Course of food borne disease so although. Maybe there are not defined as life. They are fairly relevant because they can make us. Ill. So microorganisms. Are everywhere. And in this picture. You can see animals fish. Humans plants and birds so living subjects that contain microorganisms. In their intestines on the skin. These organisms they eat. So. Animals they eat animal feed. We as human beings we eat. Products of animal origin and of plant origin and. By deaths we are get contaminated. Then after eating. We produce faces and. Friends all faces can go to the water or the faces of farm animals can go to the soil. And in that way. All these structures. Can contaminate the. And consume certain parts of the other us and so we got to contamination pathways. And as you can see here in this graph. These condemnation pathways are rather complex. And that is relevant to realize because that means that by doing simply one thing. Generally you cannot solve the contamination of food products. We. Apart from having already this difficult structure you have also firm and. Air that our importance going to my nation roots of. All these different places. And therefore by simply doing one thing. We cannot prevent contamination. We have to look at it from different angles and look at all these confirmation routes. To investigate and. Control or microbial. Contamination. So microorganisms are everywhere. But bass backing. That this is his hypothesis. He said. Microorganisms. Are everywhere. But the environment selects. And that's the next step. Microorganisms are there. But they need a suitable and violence to live and that ecological niche. And they need resources they need. Nutrients to grow and. The conditions. Around them need to be such that they can grow for instance to be a short attention. Dump what you need to be such that the microorganism can grow. So they need something to eat. And their environment need to be good for them to be able to grow. So that difficult flora of a certain and firemen's which can be a food product or. An animal or it or and test and. The typical. Flora. In such a place. Will be often found. It will often be the same type of micro going to that will be found because the organism that is there has competitors vantage. It is there. But also. It gets its nutrients there and the environment is such that it's going very well. Grow so to summarise microorganisms. Can be everywhere and they will be everywhere. So there will be many different organisms that can possibly contaminate our food so that is one angle. They can be there. A lot of them can be there. But it's to environment that selects and. That will select which of the microorganisms. Will grow faster because it's the most suited to this specific environment.",

                "text": "This lecture will introduce spoilage. Shelf life. The courses of spoilage. And introduce sources. Of contamination. Spoilage is a decrease of quality. And a spoiled product is a product of which the perceived quality is not any more acceptable. The shelf life of a product is the time that food remains of an acceptable quality. Often presented as the best before date. And this. Guarantees to quality actual buttes of the food products. The spoilage of the food products can be as a result of microbial spoilage for instance as if occasion of a food product or bad odor formation by microorganisms. But there are also many other quality of reactions like for instance mechanical. Spoilage of a food products. For instance a product can be bruised or broken. And if we have a food product frances is falling down its. Drops. Then there can be a better quality due to the bruises that are produced. So that is one example of a food. Spoilage process. But it can also be for instance. Insect damage. That insects are within a fruits and therefore the product does not look good anymore. There can also be. Get mco or and somatic reactions. As an example for instance fat. Oxidation or browning. That's can make a food product brown. Not look. Looking good anymore. There can also be physical processes like for instance fat segregation or. Drying off of food products this. Orange is too much dried out and. Not looking good anymore and not of good taste anymore. Also in certain cases and especially with fruits and vegetables. The physiology of the product can continue. And a product. Can get. Overripe. So all these different processes can spall of food products. But an important one is. Microbial spoilage. And microbial spoilage mostly. Will be. As the result of that metabolic. Reaction. Star do occur due to. Microbial growth and. They can produce. Of odorous they can produce asset and in certain cases can produce a slime. In a food product. And sometimes it are even. The microbes themselves that are giving physical deterioration of a food product and that is generally to result of the growth of malts. So as a rule of thumb microbial sports becomes noticeable. At ten to the seven cells program of food or ten to the seven cells per milliliter of food. And then to the seventh that is ten million. Cells program of food products. So huge amounts of microorganisms are needed to really notice these. Quality deterioration processes. And since those levels. Are so high. The shelf life of a product depends both on the initial quantum the nation so much. How many microorganisms are present initially but also the growth of the microorganism because in order to reach that high levels of ten million sounds program. Definitely the microorganism. Need to grow. So where are these microorganisms coming from the initial confirmation. The initial going to the nation. Is coming from all kinds of sources and. Food products are generally. Coming from animal sources or from planned sources. And these animals. They have a skin. These animals have and test insulin just like human beings. And on skin and in the intestines there are huge amount of microorganisms. So the animal sources of our food products are not sterile. Also plans are not steroids or vegetables and fruits. Because they come from. Soil. Often manure is used in the production and. The products. Are irrigated with water which is also not a sterile source so. Animal and plants. Already contain. Microorganisms they are not sterile. But then. We are going to process these foods and. We can have a secondary contemn a nation. Again. In the food production we make use of water. We make use of equipment we have for slowed the process for the process of. We make use of mice. That can. Again contaminate of food products. There is also. Air around us. With arrows holes. Very small water droplets and there is dust and microorganisms. Are attached. To dust. And are present in arrows holes. But then in food production. We also have people walking around. And people touching. The food products handling the food products and they with their hands they can't contaminate the food products. Also they can buy you their hair skin terminate the food products because also or hairs are of course not sterile. Those people can. They can cough. Producing aerosols again. And in certain cases they can. Sneeze. And with that. They gone terminate the environment or directly. Contaminated the food products. And apart from these people. There are also other create your surrounds like. Ferment like mice and rats. Birds and insects. Of course we try to prevent these animals from being present in or. Food production on environments or in our kitchen. But just as. Like in your kitchen it can in certain cases happen. That there are insects present. And even maybe sometimes. Mice and rats. So these primary and secondary condemnations can result in an initial level of microorganisms being present. And after our presence. They can grow. And then. Reach the spoilage level. Microbial growth is often presented in a graph where we plot the logorrhea them of the number of organisms against time. If the microorganisms. Are contaminating the food products they often have to adapt to that new environment. And often starts with a lack of faith. They do not yet start to grow very quickly because they have to adapt to doubt and violence. But then if they are adapted. They can start to grow exponentially. So on a log scale day increase linearly. And in that they produce all kinds of metabolic products and i defer the moment. They change their environment such that they themselves cannot grow. Well anymore and their reach their stash unary face. And sometimes that deteriorate the food products so much that even start to die off. And reach that face. However despite a level of banter the seventh is already. Largely before the session every face is reached and therefore. The shelf life the maximum shelf life of a product. Is mainly determined by the leg phase of the organism and by the exponential growth face. If the organisms are already in a session or a face. And they don't like the food product any more. Humans definitely don't like the food product anymore. So to summarize. Food spoilage. Is the reaching of an unacceptable quality of or food product. And there are many courses for this. Food spoilage. And an important. Course of this food spoilage. Is. Microbial sportage of foods. And for microbial supporters of foods we need high levels of organisms. And for that. We need to have first an initial going to the nation. And secondly the you're going to need to be able to grow.",

People have been confronted with the behavior of microorganisms in food products. Imagine that you are living in a tribe in pre-history. And what your tribe you did catch a mammoth. And the evening of course you can then have a party and. To consume. All that meat. But generally. There will be left overs. And you need to preserve that food and already. Due to during the those times. People did find out that microorganisms can help us to ferment food products products like sauerkraut cheeses and sausages. They did find out that microorganisms gun bother us because the gun spoiled food by degger addition of proteins by i said if occasion and i got some ation. But also that microorganisms do travel on us we can get food and toxic ations and food infections. Due to the behavior of microorganisms in the food products. So when the. People are hunting and food gathering the needed to store foods. But especially when they also started and fifteen thousand before christ. With a domestic production. Of animals and crops. And they did find out that. If you keep food products dry. Away from air and light. By salting by making use of. All of those honey. Air drying and smoking. You could preserve foods. Also did it find out that you can ferment food products. By products like brad. Wine beer and milk products were already for meant that in. Prehistory. But people did not know yet that there were microorganisms. So there has recently been an article published in the journal of argue logical scientists were dead did look in a grave. From a mummy. In the early bronze age in china. And they did find all kinds of pots and pans. And also did find. Find they are left over from foot products. And they did do. Probably proteomics and i left this. And it finds out that there were key feel like. Fermented food products. In those pots and pans in this grave. So already in the bronze age. In china for meant that food products were consumed. We can also look at the development of regulation and. Around the year zero. Civil law about a romance was created and. Some of them were already related to food products like. Francis it was not allowed to sell spoiled food. That was in the roman legislation. Liotta sixth of decency and the year nine hundred. Did for bit the. Consumption and production of blood sausages. The reason was that half of his army was at a certain moment killed by consumption of these blood sausages. And a swiss cities and thirteen of nineteen. A rule came out that it was prohibited. To sell fish. From the day before. Fish is generally spoiling fairly quickly. So it was forbidden to sell fish. From the day before. But there was an exception. It was allowed to sell it to strangers. So if you look at the fine stocks were based on this legislation. We can see that. Emperor leave a sixth of the sensorium forbids this making production of la sausages and also to eating them and. It was. If you would do so and you were a corpse. You could lose all your property. And you could be exiled so it was a severe punishment. But not only for the person doing this. It was also the chief magistrate of the city. Would get a fine of about thirty five thousand euros. And today value. But if we now look at the current legislation in france japan in two thousand and twelve. There with us for britain and restaurants to sell. Raw beef. Beef lever. You have to cook it. And the temperatures to cook this. Are prescribed. And if you don't do so you can get a fine of two millions yes. And understand. Twenty thousand. Rows or two years in jail. So you can see that there is a very similar way of legislation in. During the years. But all these. All these people did not know yet. micro-organisms and the first one to really see these microorganisms was on the only family walk. And he that he was not a microbiologist. He was a tailor he was making clothes. But in order to look at the structure of these clothes he was making use of lances and with these lenses he did find out if you make use of two lenses you could get a much bigger magnification. And he did use that for his clothes and. For his linen. But also in a free time he was investigating. All kind of order things like for instance the sleeve and. He was taking water from the kennels and investigating debts and. By looking at that he saw all kinds of little animals and. Those little animals he did the scribe and he did write about that and sent out to the royal academy. And london and. In that these microorganisms were a little bit. Distributed. You could say the knowledge of this. However we did not have and tonight in those days so it was only a very limited amount of people that read. The things that on the only family will get that right. So it was known. But not by many people. And that makes that. Some centuries later. When napoleon wanted to better preserve foods for two centrist groups. Further away. He did write out a contest in which he asked people to invent something to make. Foods. Of a longer shelf life. And there was a cook. In those days nicholas a pear that then came out with a method. And that method was cooking food products for a couple of hours or two hundred degrees. In a closed the glass jar. That made. Foods. Of a very long shelf life. And he was a lot of this prize an eighteen and a ten by napoleon. But still. Nicholas a bear did not know anything about microorganisms. He just invented that method. And he presumed that the principle was. Air exploration. Due to closing these glass jars and by long cooking. Issue all oaxacan would go out and therefore. You would have such a long shelf life. So this was. Food technologists but not yet. A food. Microbiologist. And the real first. Foods market we are just. Was louis pasteur. He really did make the scientific basis of the domain of food microbiologists. All sort of people still was not a food microbiologist from a region. He was again missed. And he started his research go a year with investigating garro compounds. But he also invented bester a station. He looked at. Spontaneous generation. He did investigate if. Life can be created from nothing from only. An organic material like sugar and water. And he did prove that. That is not possible you really need to have some sort of in a collation you need to have some. Life to create new life. And also. He did. Investigate. The facts and nation. Against radius. So he was a very. Generalistic scientist. Investigating all kind of different aspects. But largely also in the domain of foods markedly ology. And eight hundred ninety six. The first case was fairly well described. Of food borne disease. And this was a paper written by a professor of and one hundred. Us from belgium but he did write an article in the german language. And eighteen of the ninety six. Concerning an big outbreak of a food borne disease. And from all kinds of different aspects this is a paper of sixty basis. Organ of different aspects he did describe. So there was a party at a wedding. Were again. A blood source which was consumed and. Everyone who had eaten the blood sausage. Became ill. So in that investigate the production process of the last source you just you looked at the storage gone the shots at the symptoms of the disease. He looked at other food poisoning cases. And also he did. Isolate the microorganisms looked at its characteristics. How much salt is needed to prevent. The growth of this organism. He did investigate a toxin. And the effect of the stocks in all kind of animals. So it was a very wide description of the case of food borne disease. Then in the next century. Many more microorganisms were describes. Related to food borne diseases. And in many cases. It first started by looking at these microorganisms in relation to animal health. Because there were a lot of animal diseases. But in certain cases later on. It was also found out that these organisms were not only infecting animals but. They could also cause. Human diseases like francisco. And hysteria. Were first only described in animals. But were in the end of the twentieth century also found to be important to human diseases. So not only new microorganisms were found but also the new characteristics of microorganisms in this graph you can see the change of the antibiotic resistance. Of microorganisms during the years in the one nine hundred fifty s.. So microorganisms. Had antibiotic resistance with most of them. Were susceptible to antibiotics. But with the use of. Many antibiotics both an animal health and human health. We can see a large increase. Of the resistance of microorganisms. Against antibiotics. So we can see that. Food research did develop until the one nine hundred sixty s. footmark ability. Was a very qualitative science. We did look what happens. But we did not really try to understand. The governing principles. But since ninety six the. It really became a science including. Biochemistry molecule or biology and all kind of a little methods. To better understand what was going on. This same type of revolution. We have also seen in the industry because in the beginning it was very much craftsmanship without really. Much knowledge of what was going on but it really changed from craftsmanship. To a technological industry. Also in research. We. She new developments. We see. Improve an improvement of traditional methods. The use of. Common organic many yeah. And all kind of mini or ticed biochemical methods that are. Colorful. But also giving us good insight and the behavior of microorganisms. And especially. All the developments of moloch in our biology. The genome x. the transect almost proteomics amendable omics. Help us to better understand the behavior and the characteristics of the microorganisms. In our foods. So again. Looking at food control. We can see that after the roman states started to it's including. Rules in the civil law. Also in the twentieth century. A lot of new legislation came out. A lot of microbial testing. Was developed. The start of the best or a station and sterilization occurred and. It also became into legislation in the one nine hundred sixty s.. Good manufacturing processes. Were described and all all in one nine hundred seventy has that analysis critical control points. That was a method that was originally developed. To preserve the foods of the astronauts going to the moon. But later on the system. Was further developed and it's. Game really into legislation and the european union in one thousand nine hundred three in one thousand eight hundred the start of quantitative microbiology. Occurred. And in one thousand nine hundred five. Quantitative risk assessment. Was developed. And these methods are now also used to better i said to our legislation. Also our society of course changed. And you can see that. We changed from eating a lot of gantz. Food products with a lot of additives to more fresh food products. Generally to consumer wants to have. Ready to eat meals. Want to prepare fairly quickly their meals and. Need to be ready to eat. And we see a large globalization. There is a quick transfer of raw materials from. All kind of. Parts of the worlds. Both of animals. Raw materials. And also humans. Travel a lot. Making. Also that we distribute a lot of microorganisms over a globe. And we see an increase of the health products. France is probably out of products. And all these developments. Have occurred in the last century and sometimes we think that that is really the things of today. But considering these health products. If you look into history again. And if you look about two hundred years ago and. We look at an advertisement. Of the health strength from medicine a cough. In one thousand eight hundred and we read this. You could almost see that as the advertisement of. Probably other food products. Of today. So certain things we think that are already the sinks of today. But and. This happens sometimes. Also before. So to summarize. Food market reality. Is and sinfield. It already started in. pre-history. However it constant constantly evolves. By changes in the microbes. By changes in our research. By changes in our legislation and. By changes in the constant consumption habits of the consumers. Look and wonder.",

The behavior of microorganisms in food and. The behavior of microorganisms. In food. Has three dimensions. You have to good the bad and the ugly. The good ones. Can ferment of food products. This is francis' yogurt. And in yogurt. You have good microorganisms that have prolonged the shelf life of these food products. It makes the product better digestible. And also in certain cases can have very good health. Got a very good health aspect. But apart from that. You also have the best microorganisms. This our friends is the seeds of sprouts. And if they are germinated and as are pathogenic micro-organisms present. You can get a very bad. Illness out of it. And you also asked. Food products can also spoil. This is not. May be attracted to public health. But of course it's not very good for us for the sustainability of a planet. It's not good for or economics and. Also in places of course.

To control the food safety and to make the product safe. And to get to a very good quality and. Very great taste. And this brings me to the mission. Of our laboratory. And the mission is to generate.

                "text": "There's not a ship. Aims to give an overview of the culture and techniques and the calculations involved a mark of a logical explanation of foods. The first matches. To determine microorganisms in food. Is direct x. emanation. Under the microscope. That is very very useful for fungi. Collect area. It's not applied. That much because it has a disadvantage dabs. The direct examination and the microscope has a very high detection image you need. At least ten to six. Microorganisms for a male to see anything. And on top of that there is interference of the food particles. With the bacteria that you aim to see you see that drop us and think there are bacteria that's a true. Filtration of water for example. In combination with fluorescent staining of the organism. Hopes that record examination of food so it is very useful. So fickle fudgy. But for bacteria. To use an image from buckcherry we need to culture. The organisms before we can see them. So den. We come out to traditional plate. Can technique. If they are. We take a sample. We put it in a in a back to dilute it tenfold. And then dish dilution which is called. Minus one dilution. Is brought onto an aggregate. Were can grow. And then after. Incubation period. You can look at the number of organisms. In your food item. The problem is if there are many organisms. In the original food sample. Let's say. We're analyzing like with milk. If there are many organisms. In the sample needs to be diluted. Before we can see an appropriate. Number on a plate. So schematically. This looks as follows. We have to original sample her milk. This is the looted. With. Nine times. The volume of the original sample to get a ten fold. Dilution. So one mill of milk. Nine mil. Off. Dilution till its. p.p.s. popped on. But your logical. Sole solution. In general. This is called. The primary. The primary dilution on minus one dilution. Often made in a back. And from this you can dilute herder. By transferring one mil. Into nine mil of p.p.s. to get to minus two. Minus three minus four. Minus five. So it's done in chips. And it is called. Decimal dilutions. These that's a mill. Dilutions than. Are transferred onto in our plates. To let the organisms grow and this can be done in two ways. The first way is the. Poor whites technique. Thank you take your decimal dilution. One mil. You pour it into an empty sterile plates. This is what it looks like. And then you add a liquid at a temperature of forty five to fifty degrees. And you make scaffold. To latch the organisms wick. Mix with the agur. And then the plate is incubated. Alternatively you could use plates that have already pretty people. Prepared so you get a plate with. Agger in there. And you plates. The sample to the top and this can be done. Again in two ways you can use a spread technique. You apply. Hundred. Michael he does. Off your. Dilution onto the plates. And manually. You spread it. With a dedicated defies. Called a hockey stick. You can also take your pre prepared. Plates and put it in a machine. Spyro plating machine and the spiral plating machine applies fifty my creditors onto deflates in a. In and with a known volume. And in no section. And then. The organisms. Will grow in idle. Yes. On top of the anger. So these are called. Surface plates because the colonies. Will fall on the surface only. While in the previous technique. Poor play technique. The colonies will form india. In this way. The number of organisations. In your delusion. Can be determined you can even write. The colonies. And the plates counts. Is down there. Colony counts. Times the plating factor which accounts for the volume. Applied on the plates. Chimes to dilution factor. And it's. The final outcome is expressed as. Luck to you if you are lucky if you program in two digits. Let's look at it as an example. We have had ten million liters of milk. Diluted with. Nineteen mills. Of p.p.s.. Our primary dilution. This was diluted. One step further. And indeed. Minus two. The outcome. We have the plates. We have one hundred michael t. to some to the plates and. We count. Two hundred quantities. Have counted. Two hundred one of these on this page. What is the outcome. Expressed as lucky if you. Outcome is ten to one hundred colonies. See if you got any farming units. The high debt. By one hundred. Michael you truck because. Hundred likely to was applied on a plate. Not one milliliter. And we have not the original sample. But we have to minus two dilution. The result is then two hundred con and he. Tribes ten. To account for the volume. Chimes. Sent to the power to account what a secondary dilution. Comes to two hundred thousand c. a few per milliliter. And this is them. Expressed as. The page count. Is the luck value of two hundred thousand says five point three loc see if you are male. And not only. Count is important but also the nature of the aggregate on which discounts has been determined. We have selective. And nonselective media. nonselective media. Are rich in nutrients. And basically all the og and common organisms will grow on their. For example. Play to count. Our. p.c.a. or brain heart infusion arguer. B h i. If we're looking for specific. I'm going to since we take. Outer plates we take. Selected. Media that favor one organism only and not allow the other to grow. For example. Beachy suitable. To detect and. m.r.s.a. is for lactic acid bacteria. aloa is for this story i want to judge innes. And it ition. These. So elected. Media. That suppressed. All the organisms. Maybe. So much scenic. So that it wanted organism. Shows a very nice color. And you can pick it out. You can elect it. And that better discriminates between the chocolate organism and the outer organism. Media have been carefully designed. And should meet a number of creech area. They should be selective. They should. Inhibit the competitive flora. And favor. The growth of the talking going isn't. They should be specific. So they should be able to discriminate between achad an organism. And the other organisms. And also. They might be elected. So that they have optimal colony. Current draw sticks. Let's look on it at an example. For example. A lab median. It's a crime one medium for history i want to judge on this and all this steria. Species can grow on there. And they form. Bluish colonies. Listeria monocytogenes s. can be elected. Because it has a ring around. Qualities that she can see there. So this. All of this played. Is selected for hysteria. It's. Specific. Because you can see a nice color blue collar off of this area. And it's effective. Because it has for a good discrimination between one a sitar genus and the on a serious piece. To summarize optimal media friendly imports and. If you want to get a reliable. Outcome in microbiological acceleration. You can have selective. nonselective media. You can put in place yourself. Or use pretty poor expats such as plating. You can that you need to take into account. The dilution. And the volume play to it and it's very important. Do xpress. The outcome. In a generalized way. Five point three x. that extra leg see if you.",

Let us look at the organisms that our presence. Includes the first place. There's. Spoilage organisms. The ugly. And they're analyzed. For example. For aerobic. Plates counts. So analyzed spoilage showed them on aspects of my saliva spall almost east's animals for food safety. Pathogens are in the last as there are some and i lack empathy bactrim list area. And many others. So sampling can have too. But persists. I just something for. Spoilage or something. To see whether or not pathogens are in doubt. And to do this. Many different techniques are applied to. Let's start with the sport that you are going to. As a rule of thumb a product. Is spoiled. When it has. Around ten to disciplines see if you. Common the farming units. Program or. Emily chang. Than. Spoilage becomes apparent because you can smell it or see it or destruction breaks apart. If spiders are going to grow into products. They might require a little lag phase then they start growing exponentially. And around ten to deceptions. See if you sow ten million. Microorganisms by meal. Spoilage becomes apparent it can be a little lower or a little higher spiritual can isms one will than grow for a go but its products. Will usually not get eaten. As it is physically spoils. Eventually spoilage organisms. Become in a stationary phase. And the product is gone before jan two to seven. Is reached. Supported john isms. Are in a product might be in there. But you can't see them. And that's why. Products are analyzed. For example for. Cho till mrs finnick bites can. Or aerobic. Plates counts. That is done. As an indicator for. Low quality of the ingredients. As an indicator for storage problem sort of products or poor hygiene a conditions. This or of a quake around. Is done. As to indicate. There's more indicators. There. This is done for all products but there's more. And they cater for example enter back cheat sheet art and indicators as well. Sometimes called. And they are a sign of an adequate heating uncooked product to contain any bugs cook brotherhoods should not. Because central are heat sensitive organisms. So if they are in it. In a he treated product. It's a sign that this product has not been heated correctly or that it got contaminated afterwards and. That's a sign of poor and. Conditions. And that's why our analyst. And he treats its products as indicator organisms. This morning the caterers for example. Fecal coliform so. A subset of our. Analyzed as an indicator for fecal contamination of a product or in environments. Suffolk because arias is analyzed. As an indicator off of consummation suring manual work so it's analyzed in products that have to be manually handled. As a sign of temperature abuse. Essent fungi are commonly analyzed as indicators of the quantity of fruits and vegetables where they are preference. And lactic acid bacteria in the same group of products fruits and vegetables. But also in here in meats that has been stored under. Modified air. Packaging. Modified air atmosphere. These are. Whole range of indicators for various products. And various reasons. He saw its. Sign of quality will also need to know about pathogens and. Goodloe safest that damps acceptable concentration of full blown pathogens is a very very low. For example someone ella. Needs to be absent in twenty five gram. Analyzed and hysteria and want to touch and us. Can only be one hundred gram. On the program. Or last at a moment of consumption so this level is very very low. And for these levels you can do quite can't because it doesn't fit. I for this reason pathogens are analyzed in a different way. They are first and reached. And richmond is required before you can see them. And richmond. Is putting an amount of product for example twenty five grams in a jar. And then storing it. Overnight so that the pathogen. If resins can grow. To numbers that are detectable in the next step. In this. Overnight incubation a pathogen may be one program in a damaged state can resuscitate can come to life again. And then. Growth. And then the second stop after overnight. It gets detected. And look at actor numbers twenty five gram is and which. And then from from this and only hundred migrate or so so is transferred to the next step which is suitable. To detect the organism in its case with a color change of the media. From purple. To yellow. And then in this second third step. The. Pathogen it. Oscillates on a suitable medium and he you can see that from the nine different. And richmond's some. Were positive. Showing a screen colonies on the plates we have three plates with a total nine. Isolations. Six were positive or negative. And richmond's gifts. Has two possible outcomes. Positive or negative. The pathogen. Is there. Or it isn't. And in a couple of days. You can detect an isolated. The pathogen from a food products. That is focused. At the chairman of a chain for food safety. We detect sebastian should we determine its presence or absence. Or absence from its presence to detect that. You isolate it. So you set it apart from spoilage farm. And you literally have to pathogen there. On a plates. Isolated from the matrix. And then you identify it so you determine the identity is it. Truly the someone ala'a or a subset to each arm and a genius or species of to talk it all can isn't that it's done for food safety. For food. Spoilage. You don't usually do. Detection and identification because it's not that important what it is. But in i'm ration. Is to determine the microbiological counts. Usually first. Sometimes also for pathogens. And the outcome is locksley if you or. Look see if your program. There is a technique or third technique that combines both. So it is for food safety. And it gives an indication of the numbers and that is called. The most probable. Number technique. For the most probable number technique. You. Incubates. Nine. subsamples. For example to incubate. Tree times one gram. In a chip. Tree times. Point. One gram and three times point zero one gram. So there's a ten fold. Difference between three and then there's an enrichment. There is a detection and. If you can see that for example. All the. One gram samples a positive. So after. Point one gram sample from the smallest sample only one is positive. This you can reads as score. The code here is. Three to one. And in table. You can look up. What dan. The most probable number loss. That loss. Press and. India original products. And from a table we looked up. Most probably the last fifteen see if you program. Plus or minus something. In the original products. So this is a combination of detecting a pathogen and. Estimating the most probable number of this pathogen in a product and it's used for example quite a bit. Walk us through the imperfections in spice. To summarize this knowledge clip. Was to give you an overview of to different techniques that are priced to analyze a product for quality or for food safety. For foot quantity. Usually. Animation techniques are used for food. Pathogens both in them ration. And richmond's are a price.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip. Is to explain you. About zoning. Which is the prevention of the entry of. Microorganisms. To areas where you don't want them. It's a separation of. Clean and dirty areas. Into local area where products are. That still are. He treated. And that will be rendered safe and intermediate a high care area where products are presence. That are eaten. Without further heating. How this is done in practice. Can be seen in an expectation. When we see an example of a contract control nasha. That should prevent the entry of betta genic microorganisms. In the clean side of the factory. This is the clean side of the factory. And this person. Changes his shoes. Before he enters the clean side of the factory. So. And decide. What a blue bin is. He has been wearing shoes and he has dedicated choose to enter the area or in this case. Powdered milk is produced. And he sits on the bench. Changes and there is some discussion whether he should place his shoes on the bench that changes his shoes. To make. As a control mattia. To keep control over the. Pathogens. To keep them from and trying. The raw product sides. But let's first look at the potential sources of country nation that are important. And that should be separated. First and foremost. The most important thing. That's bring spatted sions into defection and lyman's. Our products like here. The raw chicken. And the baggages that might be present on raw meat should not contaminate the. Cooked meat. Like these beautiful. Baked chicken wings. But that could also be the. Why dust for example from spices. That may carry pathogens and other organisms into the factory. What are as important as well what i can splash on to cook products. And what is also important. Are the employees. That's may carry pathogens. If they work with raw materials onto the cooked materials. They may carry it on the shoes around are the hands. Sometimes they may carry it. Naturally. On their hands like stuff argus. Another important source. That should be prevented are pests because they breach. Zoning and they run around everywhere. And what is also important. If. Equipment. Like hand tools and cleaning tools. If they're used with the raw product. And later use with a cooked product. Cleaning tools. May contaminate rotterdam clean. And if hand tools are used by maintenance. Engineers. They're used. And a raw material section. And into. Cooked material section. They may bring unwanted contamination. Into is own. Ideally a plant layouts. Is as follows the raw material. Comes in this science. That it is processed rendered safe. And distributed on the on the hands of science and done. Ideally. Auto things. And people come in at a king size. Air is drawn in to clear sides. And leaves a dirty side but that is. Ideally. And is can only be done wonders a new factory in old factories. We have to live with how the situation is. But. Zoning. Separates a set of control measures that separates. Raw materials that still have to be he took from products that are he tweeted and for. Medium care products in medium care products are that. Are he treated. But are not very vulnerable to be contaminated. For example they are packed. All i care. Is only for ghost products that are heated without further consumption and are. Unpacked. For example this product is produced in a high care area. It's a sandwich. With chicken media and agues and out of things. And it's produced manually. And we should take. Utmost care. Not to contaminate. Because then it will spoil. Before it gets eaten into lama. Is also produced in a high care area. When i'd spray drives. You need to take. Utmost care. No. Microorganisms and of. Ready limited number of spoil the throw is present because infant formula. Is consumed. Without further he treatment. By a ferrari. Vulnerable group. Vulnerability is sticky. How vulnerable is the products to consummation zoning. Separates the different areas and hikari the high care area. In the middle. Is also for example. The filler hats off a septic processing. Where liquids. Are fills the small area. Around if it is a septic and is a hike area. It's only to fill or have not the whole machine. Not a whole area. Recently zoning. Is increasingly. Done by. Sourcing out. The raw materials. Treating the raw product in an outer area. Maybe in a not a factory. By buying. Best ross products. And then processing. So this is for example done with chocolate that gets a treatment in one factory. And then is produced. To make into a nice chocolate in a not a factory. Not all products require a high high change him. Sometimes i quite often. Medium care area. Is sufficient so you have two zones. A low care area. And a medium care area. And the pan. What you buy you can outsource the raw materials. And then you have only a medium carry on one size. How does this look in practice. Let's look at a factory work. In some form or not is produced at this. Infant formula. Factory to have to literally a from milk here. And that is area. With raw materials. The milk is standardized how much on ice and the best price. And after that. The milk and stop. In and out of zone after that pesters ation. It's called high hygiene. Maybe medium hygiene but definitely an auto zone and here. Then it's if i paraded to get rid of most of the water. And then there's a spray dryer. To get rid of the rest of the water and i but it comes out of the spray dry out a product is very vulnerable because it is in the air and it's cooled by air and his air should be absolutely free. Of microorganisms. Done by filtration. So the air is drawn by a filter. From this area. And then eventually. From the the outside. By several filters. So. Air filtration. Is a measure of zoning. But there's more. Control national suppose owning people change their clothes here and they will sit on the bench. Change shoes. There's not a changing room and. Pretty people who work with the raw materials. There's also. Zoning here. To prevent pallet. Trucks from driving into the high high chains and so. A pallet truck. Will put a pallet. With packaging material. Onto a bench. It's picked up and decides. I'm finished products. It's. Transported to the other side. In a similar way. So there's many. Control measures that make. Zoning. Effective. The story. Of fact brother. Can be in a low hygiene. Because there's no chance of. Contaminating a pack of products. The office. Contain are also aloha. Doesn't mean that it's dirty. It's perfectly clean india. But it's not as from normal. As the high hygiene with young packed product. But it's how do we know in which you don't we are regular stuff we'll know. But what about. This is us and maintenance engineers. Let's look at to pick just off an ice cream factory. One of which is a medium. Hygiene. Area with cooked. Product best rice product. And the other one is located. With the raw milk. So here's the two pictures a second picture. What is this is this raw products or is this a good product. So let's look again. Where are we are we in the region hygiene joan. Or the locators or i'll tell you this is the area. With the best rice products. These are the vessels where ice cream mix is stored for a couple of hours before it's frozen. And it doesn't look as clean as the other one. But inside these tanks there's best rice products so these things are absolutely not opened during one definitely. And this is the balanced tank. For the best arise as part of the best rise or. So in this area looks right. But it's. Area with raw milk. That still needs to be best arise. So the looks of it. Are not a signal of the zoom. This is raw material so. And this is the cooked materials. So it's very difficult to see and. Color codes are needed and clear signaling to know where you are especially for temporary staffan and maintenance. So to summarize zoning. Is the separation of the factory. Indifference. With cooked and. Uncooked product. And the zoning is done. According to the vulnerability of the products. And should be applied for a strictly because you cannot have. One person walk back and forth from bra materials to cook materials and. Because pathogens. Be established in an area where you absolutely don't want them to should be applied by strictly.",

                "text": "So welcome. I am to survive a bit of an about like to tell you more about it. Detests. Hope. When you use a detests. So you do say tease this friend you have. Numerical data. So continues out. And you have two groups. So for example a treatment group and a control group. So you have two types of t. tests. So back to test in an imperative test. Impacted this. You used the thirty days for example when you do a course over study. Then in that in search of design you have a information about outcome. After intervention period. And offered a cultural period. In the same person. So they are dependent. And then back to dust. The impact do you. Then you have a pile of arm design. For example. So you have the outcome. In a croup. After intervention and. You have information about the outcome. In a control group. In a cultural group. So you don't have to out commercials. After the venture. In an impaired to tests. So both tests have some assumptions. So if back to his days as humans. Does the individual differences are normally distributed. So first you have to strike. The out. The outcomes. In the end. After the intervention period. From the outcome. In the consul periods. The part. T. test. Assumes also dead to the outcome variable is normally distributed. And also dead. The fairy answers are roughly similar in both groups. So when you have an intervention group and of course to group. You have to have about the same variances. So when you want to know. Red adair is actually a difference. You have to do a statistical analysis and. These to do. Canelo says are based on the t.v.. Feel you are deaf or dare call t. test your you see a table. That you often see venue run and. A analysis. Of when you do a party test. So you see a mean. So does mean is the average individual. The average of all the individual differences. And years distended area are at or around this mean. And these values. You can use to calculate the value. And you can see the formula that you can use to come up with this fellow you and. So what you see here. We substract the. l.d.l. cholesterol level. Intervention from the l.d.l. cholesterol. Also tracing a control group. It is negative. And it is highly significant. High least to school significant. Which means that l.d.l. cholesterol is a lower intervention croup than in the control of an after control period. What if you do it. Impacted test. You see again a mean. But does mean. Is not calculating the same day. Because you didn't mean is in this mean if you want to cope with this mean you have to subtract the mean. Of the intervention group. From the mean in account. Crop. And you see the standard. Area around this me. So i told you a dead one of the symptoms of the impact did this is that the variance are roughly similar. And that's what you can test with levine test. Shown over here. So you see it's not so to discuss when if guns. So just means that you can assume that if areas are awfully similar. So in that case you can use this lying. Year and you'll see that it is to this cause can have guns. It's means that there is a difference between dick in the friendship group and you cultural group. If it was to disco significant. You can decide to do a transformation or you can. No parametric test but the evidence also a method that you can adapt your. A decrease of freedom. And then you can just use the unpaired. T. test which is adapted. And in this case. You conclusion. We'll not change much. So death is what i wanted to tell about the parrot and party test. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip. Is to explain about one of the hygienic mash ups which is best controlled best controlled is very. Importance. And of course. Humans are not a past not at all but today may transfer of pathogens. If they happen to be ill or a day may bring birth. Durch. On their shoes or on the hand and carry it into the food factory. That's why a lot of factories are closed for fits of tears and that's basically a pity because it would be nice to see many more food production facilities. There's also a lot of his success and. You can see some. On this picture or at least a trace of this has been rats nibbling on. Dry product like flour. Now have left their traces so. They were spotted. And then they were traced. The other picture is birds who like the food production facilities because these for production facilities. Provide an abundance of food for them. And they sit on the roof and they wait until they fry can fly in the chimney. And this famed. Chimney. Conte's because this one opens. Only at overpressure and. This lit. Will drop down. If there's no overpressure soden. Birds are prevented from going in there. That like to go to in there. There is lots of food for them but. Why it should be a fight them. Because they are. They cause entry of. Pathogens into the environments. And they make contaminated raw materials for their final products or to promise us. Mice and roof rats have been shown to carry someone are up to eight o'clock see if you. Program. Off. Fecal dropping. This means that each fecal dropping is a volcano. Of. Pathogens. India environments. And if you combine that with the fact that they have been shown to shut someone up over three months. And half. Several litters a year. With a lot of new young rats. Than. It is clear. Rats. Can suppress. Someone are all over the factory. They do not on the sprats pathogens. It's also. For example i'm phoebe and sweats have been shown to spread some of the law. While their hump over equipment births. Are common carry us. Off company backed or someone out and out of partitions. And also insights. Have been known to sprout. Pathogens. And they can come. Basically everywhere. They struck by the genes but they also do damage to raw materials and food products. They nibble on two cartons and backs. Spread out to material which then gets contaminated. And those are no reasons why to avoid to pass. Prevention is very important. And the first. Barrier. Is fencing. To get large animals out like dogs. Than small wire mesh. Is important to get to keep the birds. Out and let them not fly in. And holes and drains need to be sealed. To prevent rodents. What is also important is to prevent bats. From accessing the water supply and. The food that is. Transported out and don't forget to waste and waste. Is also an abundance of food for pests. And if you look at a picture like this here is where waste was not very well controlled. And this was really haven't on earth for. Pasts. They were attracted to and they got i really got a problem. Now how our past that. Controls. For example by. Traps this is a mouse trap. There's something in there. That's. Kills the kills the mouse. So every week. These traps need to be checked. In this factory there were approximately fifty of these traps all spread around and. At the end of the work week. One employee had to check all of them. So fifty times. Get down on his knees. Check to trap. There was nothing in there. The second one. The third one. Up to the fiftieth one. That's not the nicest ask you can half so what a q.a. manager did. To make sure that this staff member. Would do this once every. So many weeks he would get some plastic. Mouse a red one and a good place it endows. And then at the end of the day. This. Red one and blue one had to re reports it than the q.a. manager knew for sure. That one of the staff members had really checked the stat that the traps. So this hot. Is how this. q.a. manager made sure that pest control was really done and want to turn to another type of insta pest control. And insect trap. It's a lamp. That attracts. Insects. They fry to enter and there. They receive electric shock. And there they go. That is advantage of this. Is that insects. Tend to fall apart. And that's insect lacks and wings spread so there's a container on the knees. But this type is not preferred any more because they change. Also to spread. Insects part. So it's pest control can also be done in a way to make. Spreads the pest in start off. That controlling it's. To summarize prevention of pests. Is better. Thank your ring it's. Because the cure. It's not easy and. They may already have spread to pathogens. So. Facilities need to be designed in a way that allows the staff to keep best outs. Food water. Packages. Need to be protected from past. And all of this. Need to be monitored and controlled.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip is to introduce you to variety of quality systems that may be presence in a food factory. In a food factory. A lot of terminology issues. With regard to quality systems. For example the g.m.p. good manufacturing practices. Good hygiene practices. A subset of. Good manufacturing practices and. Recently there have also been called. Operational prerequisite programs. A lot of programs. That should. Assure the safety of the water. Correctness off to cleaning. The correctness of procedures. Operating procedures. It's all covered with the term operational prerequisite programs. And those programs. Are a prerequisite for as up. Asset analysis a critical control point system. And sometimes. Company also have c.q. and. Total quality management. Which is all over arching. So a large number of terms are being used. And they all are aiming at improving. Food safety assurance. You could say that there is for yes laughs of hygienic mashups that can be employed lancets. The basis. And the start. Everywhere are the general principles of food hygiene. As the pilatus by codex code with the same name. They need to be applied and that offer for example that you need to half goods. Bathrooms. Enough bathrooms that are needs to be lights. That people can see what they're doing. And do not pass up. Those basic things. The doors should close. Firm and should not come in. That's for every. Food item and and there are food related hygienic requirements also stipulates bided codes of manufacturing or hygienic practices for specific products. These codes. Cover. Ammons for one group of products. And they also might spot half requirements for nutritional. Or other properties of the food. On top of that is done. One could say. g.n.p. is there. Good hygiene practices are there. On top of perhaps perhaps subsystem closing. To achieve greater assurance that food is safe. And more assurance. Can be applied by additional. Management systems like. Certification. Iso certification or totally. Quality management systems. Details of the quality systems are beyond to scope of this knowledge gap. But that basis. Is food hygiene. Good practices watch our good practices good man of friend affected the good manufacturing practices. Should make. Undesirable actions. Impossible. For example. See if there is a fire door. That goes directly to the outsides. That sometimes needs to be closed. If. Personnel. Tends to go outside first smoke. And then walk in again with thirty. On their shoes. Yeah. Then. Staff gets to close the the seal the fire doors to prevent people from walking in freely. Some first zoning. One needs to place benches. That people need to sit on. Change their shoes. And then walk in the hard unique part of the factory bury us and limit the entrance not everyone needs to go into a high hygiene zone. Those are part. Concrete actions. For good manufacturing practice those are the basis. And if you can't make things impossible. You can at least make them on like a bar. Having clear procedures who dos watch. Instructing personnel. For example. If you have been before waists and bins for. Rework. It is very wise to half them. Mate. In different colors. For example during a production process. You could have some waste something fall on the floor. That needs to go. But you could also half. Rework which is products. That is basically ok but. There's no packaging material. Or something out there is too much of a certain. Recipe on that day. That's can be diverted to back in tomorrow so recipe can be reworked. Because it is good food. But you need to this thing which very clearly. Between the waste that has fallen on the floor and the rework which basically is perfect. Raw material for the next batch. That is part of. Good manufacturing practices. To make it easy for people to distinguish between safe. Material and waste. And also it's very important for. Personnel to half. Good equipment available. For example when you look here. There is cleaning tools available readily. Besides a machine where people need to those cleaning tools. So it's a very nice example of hawa. Equipment. Is readily available. Because if you need to walk four hundred meters to get a good brush. No one is going there where people can pick it and make it easy. So good manufacturing practices. Are a fat off. Of mash ups to make it easy to do the work correctly. As it should be done. And when there is a control national so critical that one needs to be absolutely sure that it's always ok. Otherwise. The product can be sold that house up comes in and then. It's going to be. Critical. Control point. So if there's a control measure like he treatments or. Our trite ness of a product. Essential for safety. Dare. Is the focus of hasp house up. Hazard. Analysis critical control points has seven principles. In the first one is a thorough. Hazard analysis. What is really dangerous for the consumer. Hazardous for the consumer or what could be hazardous. That's determined in a first step. And then their second stop. The charm and this piece to critical control points. Watch control marshall solder in a factory. That needs to be absolutely. Always on under control before the product can be sold. And there you need to realize that control means having control over. Control if not stop. Police labs check. No. House up in the sense of control in the sense of has a having control over and thus driving a safe product. And wages critical control point. Has been defined. Critical limits. Are defines its money torch. So there is. Control in that sense. But control. In has a means having control over. You need corrective actions. If something goes wrong. For a fire that. Document everything. Those are the seven step of hassel seven steps. Of hassle. On top of hassle. You need to make sure that all the systems are also used. So people need to be trained in good touch and practices in haslop. And also needs to be checked whether people comply with what i've learned during training. So to summarize. It is a very important to have quality systems in place for prevention. And they need to be designed and want to hurt on the road. There's many. Friends quality systems. Alongside so derry's. And g.m.p.. And hassock and that might be. I so such occasion or total quality management. But in all of them. The human factor. Is very important because people need to lift by the rules. But only think that they're there needs to be done.",

                "text": "This knowledge is to explain to you to for i a t. of measures that are taken in a framework of hygiene. Hygiene apply to our to food chain and offers a lot of things. And. Let's look at some examples when you enter a food factory. As if it's a tougher example. You are probably instructed to get off all the jewelry. Not to smoke. Not to eat. In a promise. And to wash your hands before you enter the production facility after your visit to toilets. Moreover they might ask you what are you half illness. For example diarrhea which you might spread when you enter the factory. So ill. People are not allowed in down. And you might also be required to remove everything from your pockets. Because if it's in your pockets now and it's not at the end of the date. Where did it go. That's not so much a microbe logical house that's bought more physical assets. And the last thing. They will ask you is to cover hair. Maybe the rest of your clothing with a clean coats. And let's look at how does hair covering works with. The lady here in a picture. She has covered her hair swell butts. The front. Is all uncovered. And she will shed hairs on to the product i don't know what she's producing but. This is not the way. Harry should be covered it should be covered all the way. And this is usually seen as high chain. But hygiene. Is much much more hygiene. Also considers. For example the transfer of. Pathogens from raw materials such as. Peanuts here in the eggs our bowl. Why i dust off the peanuts. To final products. Preventing this is also hygiene here. The dust. For example containing someone ella goes to ice cream. And cookies and. This has happened a couple of years ago in the united states where an enormous number of different products. Cookies ice creams. Etc. Was contaminated. Not from dust by the way but from under processed peanuts. This is also hygiene or. Hygiene should be used to prevent us and to. Illustrates the variety of measures that are needed to to make a product. Safe and. With a high quality and a long shelf life. I'd like to use an example of quiche quiche. Is a baked products. And it's consists of though. That is made from flour butter. Salt and water. And it has a filling and this case has the filling of milk. Broccoli and chief. Great to choose. It is a product that has been baked. But it's usually baked. Again at the consumer. But it. Consumer may choose to eat it. As it comes from the package so it should be considered as a ready to eat. Products. Let us see. We're into production of fish. My shots are required to make this product. Safe. And have a long shelf life. So not to spoil too soon. So let's start with the raw material. Here we have flour. What could be wrong. From a marker much cool. Point a few with flower. Flowers dry so. Nothing rose in there. But if you do not story dry or. If there's commons ates dripping on to flower. Fungi. Might start to grow in the flower and those frenchie might form my cookbooks and so that's definitely a microbiological risk. That should be prevented. During the storage. Of dry flour. Butter. Is usually. Bought pasteurized. He treats it so dead all potential pathogens are are are killed. But if you rob it. You should take into account that you may carry pathogens. Into production facilities. The same goes true for milk. If you use raw milk you also bring in pathogens. Bastardised milk or. Milk powder. Preventative so to choice. Of the raw materials. Also determines the probability of having pathogens and that. And then goes. Also goes water and water. afr after a lasting source off off off. Attention for hygiene because water depending on the source may contain a lot. Off. Bacteria. Parasites protozoa that's a truck. So it's really important. To source. Safe. Source of water. For to doe what else do we have in it oh i hear some x.. And a filling we have broccoli. Come straight from the field to rob broccoli. And it may bring all the. Microorganisms that it has got it on the field. That is usually not battered. Usually for to keep its pilots for our only buds. Should this field be arrogated with. Unsafe water. It's may also be better janick bacteria. And then we have cheese. She has usually receive a few treatments during production. But when it's greater it's that's usually a good way of contaminated meat with fringy. So dense storage conditions are very important. And our last ingredient. X. and you're probably all no doubt they might be contaminated with salmonella. But for a quiche. This is taken care off by. Heat step. One to keep them as mates. But. Let's first look at a production. I want to do is prepare flour and a mix and then it's rolled out like you can see in a picture. And that is done by a roller like to be done. Of course. In reality. In a factory this is much higher. And much bigger. But let's look at this household. Then you roll the dough. And at the end. You clean it. You cling to a machine. But when you look inside here. When you open it dirty. It's really dirty. Because you cannot really reach the inside here. So my equipment that i use in my kitchen. Because it's kitchen equipment. Cannot be cleaned because this is not regularly opened. This is non hygienic equipment. Which is not clean about. India. Of course in a large scale production. Things like this are not used. But the principle. Using clean of all equipment and cleaning it in time. Of very important so this is a non i.g.n. ikhwan and. That story the way immediately. Fighter in the process the quiche. Gets baked. And that's. Let's do it at the often. This is to stop. Were someone else from the x. and all our pathogens and spoilage flora. Should be killed. So they often shoot render the product safe. That's what. What he often does but it should doe do this with. Not only one quiche but forty. All the key issues so it's important that. True are too often. The champ archer. Is high enough to make all the cakes. Formerly. So that all the cakes. That come out. Are are gone and half received a proper he treatments. So dan. We have here. A safe products. Safe. Products. Let's get rich off this. Because this should definitely not be on the side where my just just. Baked quiche. Located. I want to keep everything on this side and this principle. Is called zoning. Keeping. Durometer. Away from the final product is really really crucial. On a wife's there is a transfer from one side to the outer. And that's what we don't want. For the fix. What we also don't want is air contamination. So products. After cooling. Need to be packed. And this package. Needs to be post and their charts to prevent contamination. We fancy spoilage. Mostly frenchie. What is also importance. Was laughed. Last thing is that a cooling. After keesha is done for a quickie because vegetative pathogens. Someone out our list area. Whatever our. Kilts. In a baking step. But small farmers aren't. A forceful foremost. This baking sap is the saying no to say good conditions let's start growing. When the temperature of the quiche drops below sixty the. Experience very favorable conditions. And will grow. Start growing. With incredible speeds. Small farming pathogens like the imperfections and assist areas can grow in cooling products. That's why cooling should be done quickly. Within x. and i'm off two hours. Down to ten degrees. So the cooling stop is important for small farmers. Pathogenic. And spoilage. That's all required to gets a product's a safe product. With a good taste. And a long shelf life. And what i hope to have shown you. With this little example is the variety of mashups that needs to be taken in the whole chain from. Irrigation. To storage. To get a good products. And if we look at the schematic few of the products of a production product. This looks like this here. A raw product comes in for example. Milk. To be best rice to. It's mixed here. Then it undergoes he treatments. It is packed sealed sceptically. And then storage in his storage colts. And no more smash are taken to to render this product safe in the first place. During the mixing. This. Equipment is cleans quite often so dabs pathogenic bacteria. Cannot. Accumulate in the production process down. We have to heating stop. Intended to kill olfactory tape of pathogens. That the product is packed. And that is done in clean. Containers and has done a septic tank. And then. The filth containers our storage. Are stored cold. Not only here. But also during transport during those you know just fix. Numerous mash ups are taken. But that's not all. There's more. There should also be a very good zoning. So doubt the packaging is present in a raw materials. Cannot for reach the out of sight at a packed products. And this person who works here he needs to be. Or she needs to be aware of dutch. So if she is working here. It's not wise to work with the raw materials or than the under same shift. Under tools that this person is using should be clean tools. Suitable to work in a and violent or cooked product is presence. And that it's also very wise to have windows and. Our entrances that can be closed. So dad burt's on the order of roman congo in the promises are important as well they should be charged to pests. What is also important. Outside to building not to attract pass. To prevent the same. And so. All aspects should be considered. And there's a lot of nationalists required to produce a safe. Product with a long. Storage time. When we look at the critics on them in tar yes. This has been outlined as guidelines. Food handling spans the whole chain. Any operation. In the growing. The harvesting the preparation the processing the packaging the storage the transport distribution and sale. Includes food handling everything included. It's not only. This one factory. And food hygiene spans. All the conditions i measure necessary to ensure safety and suitability of the food. So this is also outlined by codex alimentarius. And to summarize. I would like to stress that hygiene and control mashups are an inclusive concept through the whole food chain. It includes raw materials. It can sense the final products. It includes the processing but also the environment and. It's for pathogens for safety. And for spoilage. For a long shelf life and also safety.",

                "text": "Hello. This clip is about cancer epidemiology and special. Especially the regional differences we see in the instance. And mortality of cancer. Globally. So we already knew. In the early one thousand nine hundred that. There are differences. Here in the mortality of cancer of worldwide. And as you can see here. There are countries which had the highest mortality rate. At that time. Were switzerland. Holland and scotland. Well in the lowest and. Where sheley costa rica. How why. At the time. And when we looked at cities. Mainly european cities who were at the top. Copenhagen berlin and vienna. Well at the lower end. It was good then india. Constantinople. Istanbul turkey and years and they're all in brazil. So you can think of this this this difference does it. He says her. Has that. To do with the fact that they're treated differently or is also the. Instance in the world different. Now when we look at the global situation no. We still say that that. Cancer incidence is especially high. In the western world. So it's high in america north america and it's high in canada. Is high in europe. It's high enough strays. And it's. It's high in new zealand. But low. In africa. And most parts of asia. But when we look at specific tops of cancer we see that there are regional differences in the instance of specific cancer. For instance here we look at the global instance rate which is age adjusted. Focal rectal cancer. And we see. About. Same distribution as we just so. For total cancer so it's high. In north america. Canada and europe. Straightly in new zealand. And when we look at the liver cancer. We see. Completely different distributions. Here we see that. Liver cancer is especially high. In different countries within africa. And it's high. In some parts of asia especially in china. And when we look at stomach cancer. Here. Also we see a different distribution. Here we see that this is particularly high in asia. And it's also high. In on the west side. Of self america. Now the question is what is causing these differences. Are these people genetically different or. Does this have to do with a different exposure. Exposures or maybe combination between the two shulgin and vironment interactions. Here the pick that again. Are the differences between countries with high income. And countries which. Middle and low income. And as you can see here also the the. Incidences are difference friends also the mortalities. Are different. So. But in both of both sides of the korean i could say. Breast cancer is most important. As far as instance goes. In both sites. But. Prostate cancer and lung cancer and. Call rectal cancer. Are mainly high. In countries with a high income. While. Lung cancer cervical cancer prostate cancer stomach cancer are especially high emotion among countries with a low income. Now there's a. Five to ten fold. Difference in age ten the diary sort of says. For sake of his specific cancer. In the world. And this. Distribution as i said. Could be due to genetic or environmental factors. Ordered combination of both. So in this clip. I hoped that. I showed you that there is a huge variation in different types of cancers. Within the world and our challenges now to find out what is happening. Why is this change. This difference. Occurring globally. Thank you very much.",

                "text": "Hello. This clip. Is about cancer epidemiology. And now we're going to talk about. Age and gender. Now when we look at the. Cancer instance by age. We see that the risk of cancer is steeply increasing. Bove. Forty to fifty nine years or so from women after men a pause. And for men. After pain a pulse. Or whatever you call that. So you see a steep increase with age. And therefore we also say that. Age is one. Or maybe the most important respect for cancer. And you should always take that into account. You see that there are only a few. Cancer cases at a really young age. And those are also different types of cancer. At the late age we see. Breast cancer. A large bowel cancer called rectal cancer. We see prostate cancer in men. But at a younger age we see different types of tumors. For instance we see at a young age in men testicular cancer. And this is really happening at the. At the age of twenty five to thirty was the highest incidence of testicular cancer. Also. Horse skins disease. Is a cancer for. Among people who are still young and you also see here that there's a peak around twenty. There's also a peak at a later age. But we're now thinking that this may be another type of fourteen's disease. And there is some research. Indeed showing a difference. But hodgkin's disease. Mayle. Is indeed a disease. Of young people. So each is important. And of course. Gender is also important. You can imagine that the distribution of the types of cancers. Is different for men and women. You see that. Lung cancer is still the largest one. In men. Although that is decreasing in men the instance. And the incidence in women. Is still increasing. Prostate cancer is the second one. Among men in the world. And colorectal cancer. Is the first one. Now when you look at women. You see that. Breast cancer. Is the most important type of cancer. For women in the world. Secondly. co-directs the cancer is important among women. And thirdly. Cervical cancer cervical cancer is one of the most prevalent and most. Incident. Types of cancer in the developed world. No. To summarize you should always take. Age and gender into account. Age is the most important determinant of cancer incidence and. Also of mortality. And this is because of this exhume relation. Of genetic damage. Over time. As i said it might take thirty to forty years before. Tumor is diagnosed. Now gender is of course. Also an important factor. Explaining a different distribution in men and women. This may be due to energy news. Factors like hormones. Hormonal differences in men and women. The fact that women do not have a prostrate mate may be taken into account. But also it could be extra genius factors like smoking which is still increasing in women. Well it's decreasing in men and lung cancer is decreasing in men. But when you are looking at the association between a certain factor and cancer. You should always take. Age and gender. Into account. So to summarize i just wanted to show you that. Age and gender. Are important in cancer epidemiology. Thank you.",

                "text": "I know i'm going to talk with you about. Confounding. And how we can we deal with confounding. In a case control design. Confounding is of course present in all types of observation weapon immunological studies. But now it's about dealing with confounding. In a case control study which may be the easiest. In fact. What we could do. If you want to deal with confounding and we always have them falling so you always have to deal with it is that you could try to prevent it in the design of a case what will study. So before you start your study finke carefully. What confounding. You may deal. Have to deal with and secondly. You could deal with confounding during data analysis. First let's focus at the prevention of confounding in the design. Either buried restriction. Or by matching. Let's suppose we have this. This issue. We are looking at the whole drinking as the exposure. And want to look at the as we share a shoo in with lung cancer. Now everybody could think of the fact that. Maybe smoking. Is the confounder here. Because smoking. Is related to alcohol drinking as we know. And smoking is also increasing the risk of lung cancer so that's quite an obvious. Confounding variable that we're dealing with. But how could we deal with that in the design. What we could choose to study only among. Smokers or only among. Non smokers. Then of course you're not able to look at smoking anymore. But at least you have a broad clean. Data set of smokers or nonsmokers. That's what we call restriction. So that's one way to deal with confounding. Other way of dealing with confounding. Could be matching. You could match. Your cases. And your controls on their smoking status. And try to get the distribution of smoking. Similar among. Cases. And among controls. Also here. You will not be able to look at smoking anymore. But you or your association between. Whole and. Lung cancer is at least not. Distorted by the fact that people smoke or not. Now that's. So did see issue with with matching you could select your study subjects. On the basis that. Do you know. For non-conformists at least because you do not know or your confirm list before hand. But for known confounders you could try to get them. Equally distributed among your cases and controls. You could do that on an individual basis. So this is what we call a want to one. Met ching. He could match him smoking. But most of the time it's done. On the he year of age. For instance or on sex or the distribution. In cases and controls is similar. For. Well as according to sex. So you just have enough. If you. If you are going to invite a case for your study. And it's a man. You could also invite a male. Control in your study. There's a one to one. Matching. And you have to deal with that. Your data analysis as well. What you could also do. And which is most frequently used. Is called frequency. Met ching. Here. There's no the want. One pair met ching. But it means that the distribution of shares in variables that you finger confounders are equally distributed in your cases. And your controls. You could also do that. Afterwards when you could select a. Group of controls with a similar distribution. Maybe because maybe as far as age is concerned for instance so you have people in your case group or. Are all below twenty years of age or not all but a large part of it. So you also try to select control's who are below fit. Twenty years old at least a large part of that. Or similar part of that. Now the problem with matching. Is that we can. Eaves leap over meche. And sometimes we are not. Most of the time we are not even aware of the fact that we're doing that. But think clearly there. For clearly before you start where you have you could have an over matching. For instance. If you are going to. Met each on the fact that people have. Lighters in their in their pockets. Am because you do your your want to too much on that. Don't do that if you're interested in smoking and. A particular disease. Because you're over matching. Then. This is so strong really related to too defective that you're interested in smoking in this case that you are not able to look at smoking in this study anymore. So you really have to take care of that. And of course it makes the disco analysis highly inefficient. In this way you're not able to look at the association anymore. Also clearly watch where you're not. Over matching. Or matching on of the right. A variable that is in the corso pathway. For instance if you're interested in set rate it's fat. And hard to use. Don't match on cholesterol levels because that's an intermediate. And if you're doing that. He were not able to. That saturated fat intake. And the association with heart disease any more because you have over medicine there's no variation in your date's it anymore. What we could also do is use at the ling with confounding in the data analysis by stratification. That's similar in cohort studies intervention studies and in this case in the case control study it's not different. So you stratify for. The confounding. You're interested. For instance same thing again. You're looking at the whole drinking and lung cancer. And you're interested in whether smoking. Is is distorting that. Association is confounding that. As she should and here. Let's look at this. This is the this data of this case control study. Here you see the cases. This is blue and this is black. I hope you can see that. Here are the cases. Who drink oak all soledad ten cases who drink alcohol and are also ten cases who not drink. No alcohol. Among the controls you have five controls for drink. And there fifteen controls. Who drink do not drink alcohol. So if you are calculating. And also ratio. You will calculate this. Across. Tabulation. And you come up with knots ratio of free. Now the question is is smoking. Confound doing this as a chef. And what we could do. Is then. Stratify or. Make different. stratifications for different groups. For for the smokers and for the nonsmokers and here if we set. Great. The smoke is from the nonsmokers. You see that there are nine cases. Who are all drinkers among the smokers and their freak cases who do not drink alcohol among the smokers and. Among the smoking controls frequent foals who drink. Elko and there's one control. Who do not drink. Does not drink alcohol. So if you calculate you know. Also ratio here. You see that you come up we have all trace you know of one. Now let's look at the nonsmokers. Also here. Among the cations. Who do not smoke. Who have one drinker. And among those who do not smoke. You have a seven. Not. Drinkers. Then. Among the controls food do not smoke you have two drinkers. And the rest of them are the number exists. And if you calculate. And also ratio in this population you will see that among the nonsmokers. It's also an oath ratio for. Now overall. If you stretch the fi. For smoking. You see that you find an alteration of one. And the question is is smoking a confounding variable. In the association between consumption and lung cancer. But do you think. Yes. It is because your overall health for a show when you did not. Stratified for smoking. You found. The north ratio of. Free. And if you stretch to five smoking you find an adjusted alteration of one. So smoking is definitely a confounding in this. This as a share. So in this clip i hope. I explain to you what could happen with confounding in a case from full study. How you could deal with confounding. In a case control study. I dare. By restriction. Matching in the design or best stratification. In the data analysis. Thank you for listening. By.",

                "text": "Good day. I'm going to talk about information. Issues. In a case control study which could lead to information bias and therefore. A distortion of the author's ratio you're going to report. So let's look at information. Bias. Information bias is occurring when there's. Differential data collection in cases and controls and especially. A difference in the exposure you're interested in and. This could be due to. Information issues which you may call into fewer or. Observer. Issues which could lead to bias. And recall bias. Let's first look at the interviewer or. Observer bias. As i said here. The collection of data. Is different for cases and. Controls and. Maybe depending on the or. Or could be depending on the exposure you're interested. Now suppose that the interview would notice that the status of the. Of the cases. So she's aware of. Hoosick ace and who's to control. She may also be aware of the facts of the question. That you're interested in. For instance. Suppose we are interested in the as she shouldn't between smoking and lung cancer. Everybody knows that smoking is increasing the risk of lung cancer. And so that's the person who does. The interviews. She could also see who does have lung cancer and. Who do not have lung cancer. She's going to start that interview and she may either interpret the exposure differently or she could. Elicit the exposure status differently. In cases and controls. For instance if a kid. He says well i'm i'm a smoke now and now and then but not a not that much. She might say ok say that ten or twenty cigarettes a day. If a controlled say something like that she might say ok says five for ten cigarettes a day. So she's already putting an answer. In their mouth. Which may have an overestimation. In the cases and. A normal distribution of exposure in the controls. So this might lead to to bias. A second well. One is to recall by. Rich is very frequent. Frequently observed in case control studies. And which also may have a huge impact on the earth ratio you're looking at. A recall bias really means that people are recalling the exposure. In the past and. Notice it was a very true expected study these time. So you're asking people to remember what they did in the past. And so they also have to recall. Habits. Which may be associated with the fact that they've gotten the disease or not which may also be difficult. And may be different for cases and controls. And that's most important of course. For instance let's look at some burn in. Children. Most people now know that. If you have a heavy sunburn. A couple of times in your life. And especially during your childhood. Your risk of. Of skin cancer may be higher. Now if the mothers are. Interviewed about the previous sunburn. Of their or their children. They not. May not want to admit that they had a sunburn or maybe even unconsciously. That could happen it could also happen the other way around. And that people who have the disease. Of may think. Or about. What could have cost of the season therefore they may overestimate what they have been doing. As a researcher. You need to find out what happened. Or you could also think of a case control study especially if you're doing an interview. As a sort of police interrogation. What did you do to get that zeese. And as i said people may feel guilty. And this guy. Also may feel guilty and maybe he doesn't even want to respond. What he actually did. And suppose that this guy was severely obese. Would he ever have reported. To eat a lot of ice cream. Now. In summary. I have explained. Very briefly. Two types of potential information. Issues which may lead to information bias. In a case control study. Of serve a bias or interviewer bias and recall bias. Thank you for listening.",

                "text": "Hello. This clip. Is about. Case control studies and. Especially we're going to focus on issues of. Selection which could lead to selection bias of which case control study is notorious. So let's see what kind of selection issues we may have. There are about. Well those are the main types of. Selection issues in the case control studies where there are three main issues. You could select and. In appropriate. Case group. You could not select the proper control group and. In both groups in cases then controls you could also have a non-response bias. Which made lead to. Selection issues. I'm going to talk with you about these different possibilities of selection. Now first. Let's go to this scheme. This is the source population. That the cases and controls are coming from. And you want. The cases. And the controls to be selected based on what we see in the distribution of exposure in this. Source population. Now for the cases you want them to be reprieved sensitive. As far as the exposure. Is considered. You want them to be representative for the total gaze group. That's one thing. Cases shoot three percent. The total number of cases in your population. The controls. And that's even more difficult. They need to be reprieved sensitive. As far as exposure distribution is concerned. For the total population. So the control should have the same distribution of exposure. As we see in the source population. And. That might be quite difficult to do to be able to do that. But first let us look at the improprieties case selection. What could happen is that. Ex post cases. Are more likely to be included in your study. Then the other expose cases. And of course this could also be five percent. Think of those young women who use oral contraceptives and they a screen's body general practitioner. For fight or status and for instance for blood pressures. So possibly. Those women who are using oral contraceptives. Are more easily included in your study as cases as. Those women who do not use oral contraceptives. Now if you or you are interested in your study. On the risk. Or the association between oral contraceptives and blood pressure. You may have a problem when your cases. Do contain more women who are using oral contraceptives. Just because they're screened. More. That could be one thing. What is also possible. Of course and. Where there's always an issue. Is that you are including those cases who are still alive. That's one thing. Those are the cases. Who are most healthy. Also you are able to interview them. They may not be representative for the total called case population. Of which some have already died. Or some are too ill to be interviewed. So you also have to consider that. You have the healthy words. Then the inappropriate control group. And this is really a challenge in a case control study. Who are you going to include. As your controls. Now. Ideally. Your controls. Shoot. Re present. Those who would have been cases. If they had developed in the disease. You're interested in. And the controls. As i said should be reprinted if. For the exposure distribution. In the source population from which the cases are coming. Now what could you do wrong. And just as an example i'm giving you the one. On the friend controls. If you are including. As controls. The friends. Of the cases. It may be that friends are quite similar in their habits. Not necessarily but it could be and. If these controls. Are quite similar to the cases as far as their exposure distribution is concerned. But are not three percent a day for the total population that the cases are coming from. You might have a distorted distribution of your exposure. If for a i eighty. You look at all the fairy haitian exposure. May be smaller than than what it could be in the total population. So you may not have the true range of exposure you're interested in. That could definitely be a big problem. The first. Selection issue that i want to show you is the normal response by us. Probably. And that's the same for cases and controls your. Your response to your. Into few or to your. Questionnaire may not be hundred percent and believe me it never is. Usually it's around fifty or sixty percent and then you're already quite happy with your response rate. In a case control study. Now imagine what could happen. If not all people are participating and. That participating. Is depending on the exposure. So the numbers of participants are different in that. In the. Who are exposed and those who are an expose. And you get. Possibly as a selection that you don't want to have. Now let's look at this example. This is an example of a study in which we want to look at some pure and. Stomach paid. This is the total population. And here you see the number of cases who are thinkers and the numbers of cases who are non drinkers. Suppose that this is. You have the whole total population so this is your cohort study this issue of source population. If you were going to calculate a relative risk. You are looking at the number of cases. The fight it. By the number of total. Cold drinker so the number of cases among those who are exposed. The fight it. By the number of cases. Among those who are. Unexposed. So your relative risk. Would be one. And that's the ideal situation. Now you're not going to do. Cohort study. But you are going to select. Cases. And controls from this population. And suppose that you have a problem with the response of your cases. Cases do not want to participate. And there's a difference. In response. Between those who drink alcohol. And those who do not drink though. And as you can see here. You have hundred and eighty cases. Of the total of two hundred. Of the drinkers who want to participate so ninety percent of those who drink. Whole want to participate in your study. And here. Among those who do not drink. It's three hundred. Out of the total of four hundred cases that you could have included in your study that seventy five percent. So a ninety percent response. Among those. To drink. And the seventy five percent responsible. Those who do not drink. Now if you're going to calculate its ratio. And that's done by this right. You come up with. And also for a show of one point two which may even be statistically significant so you see a twenty percent increase risk for those who drink. Whole for the risk of. Stomach pain. First as those who do not drink alcohol. And that's definitely. Another association. Then. No association. As you would see in your cohort study. So here you see a bias. Away from the know he will say that. Indeed has an influence. Which it may not have. Due to selection of your cases. Ok for now. To summarize. You can say we discussed several several issues of selection which could occur in a case control study. And which may lead to selection bias and. A difference in the earth's ratio. As what it really is. So it could be that you have an inappropriate control group you may have a name. In an appropriate. Case group. A you may have numbers for spice. Ok thank you.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip. Is to give you an overview of the different steps that are taken during food processing. To control. Food safety. And let's look at a variety of methods. How to assure. Food safety. Now. We could for example sterilize everything. That's a possibility. We could kill all the microbial pathogens by counting food and eating sterilized products only but that's not feasible. That's not acceptable. Because it affects the quality. So we could scratch that itch. The second way which is sometimes use or. Suggest it's to use a sterile process line. But a sterile process line. When food comes in with microbial pathogens on there. It's not feasible and on the other hand sterile processes lie. Joe and exits. So we can scratch that as well. The side option is to test everything before clearance. When tested. It's safe. And then it can be consumed. Let's look at it in detail. Let's assume we have a food product. And we test five samples for someone and is five. Here on the x. x. x. x. we have to perform a food. That does contain some one hour. So the food at zero. Is free. Some one hour. At one. Everything is contaminated with salmonella. And if we don't do that twenty percent. Is contaminated. Probability of rejection. So the probability of finding someone out and then rejecting the badge. Is point. Sixty seven to thirty. So we have a two thirds. Probability that will find some an hour before. It's salt and consumes but we also. Harf a point. Forty three probability that. In none of the five. Well someone i know is firms. Which means the bachus released and is consumed. And a batch. With two n.t. percent. Some an hour just reached a market. That is not really acceptable. And another problem is that the probability of having someone in a batch is usually not around twenty percent it's reason. Usually zero or. Are very close to zero. Were the probability down of. Accepting a contaminated lot. Is very high or. Can be very high. So i think we can conclude. The probability of not finding the pathogen. Can be far too large and. Testing the final product does not assure safety. Moreover it takes days to detect someone and. If it's in there that may last longer than the shelf life of the product. It's quite expensive to do the analysis and. To lose all the products. In and product testing. And when someone are as fans we still don't know how it came there. Was it. Fired a process line. Was it in a raw materials. And the same goes true. For raw material testing. To be used in a product later. So testing the final product. Is useful still should know it but it's not a way to really. Assure. Food safety. It is an element of it but. As food. Assurance mattered. Only. It's not suitable what is then suitable. What is suitable is to control critical stops. During processing and. To do regular cleaning. That's safeguarding the products. That is done by correct processing. Heating a product correctly. When it's designed to do so to prevent contamination on the roads to prevent best's etc. To work correctly. Not to mix up waste. With raw materials etc. And this whole mixture. Off. Of control measures is called. Goods hygienic practice good manufacturing practice good logistic practices or it's called. Control nationalists. Or preventative measures. Sometimes it's called hygiene. Or as it's most often done. Now. Prerequisites programs. Operational. Prerequisite programs or p.r.p.. These are matters of safeguarding a product. So to summarize. Safeguarding the products. Is done by all these metadata chiefs which are described by coded. Codex alimentarius and here we see a small element. It's a longer process line. And product testing is part of it. But it's not the only element.",

                "text": "Strategies for prevention. We're going to talk about the population strategy what is it. And why is it effective. Well for example it's about vaccinations. Prevention of polio. These are our lungs for patients. Of polio. It is also about infrastructure road safety it's about smoking bans. It's about for example bans for large quantities of sweetened sugar sweetened beverages. Population strategies are targeted at cause of risk in the entire population. And it's aimed at we duck ssion of absolute risk. In this population. What kind of causes are these. First the. It is about the decrease of the absolute risk. So we target. The baseline risk from three to two to walk. Which means that also the high risk people are at lower risk. They may be targeted. It's the first thing that comes to our head they may be targeted at all individuals. Through health promotion. Tell people to behave healthily and that gives them freedom of choice for example tell people to quit smoking to have a healthy diet. To use fluorite toothpaste. But remember the pair prevention paradox. It may bring a large benefit to the community. But for each individual. It's just a small benefit. And that makes it so hard to change. Individual's behaviors. So if we do that. Target individuals it depends very much on the individual acceptance. Which is very much more difficult in deprived individuals the private communities and that's why we get social economic differences. Instead we can do population strategies which are targeted. And the entire population. Through rules. Through enforcement where we have no individual choice. For example. Smoking bans. And on the big soda. Product modification. Drinking water floor ideation. This is people don't have a choice. We do it and. Just like that their health or their healthy behavior increases. Health protection provisions safe routes clean drinking water. Bicycle paths to allow us to go to work by bike instead by car or air pollution standards those kind of things. Are measures that affect the total population without individual choice. But it depends very much from support from the community. Which means politics. And this is very much affected by competing interests between. Within the population do we want to pay tax money for reducing. Air pollution standards. Do we want to raise tax money to create a save infrastructure etc so that snow should for about your free rose. When he says. Causes of individual reask may be different from causes of population reask. And i want to explain this a little bit more. How do calls of individual risk. Differ from causes of population risk. Well. Causes of individual risk why does one individual. Have a higher risk of coronary heart disease then another person. Well of course is maybe. Genetic differences biological differences or higher cholesterol levels for example. What are causes of population re squad as one. Whole country. Have a higher coronary heart disease risk. Than another country. Well. This may simply be because it has a different genetic makeup. Which is unlikely. It may be because the country as a whole has higher cholesterol levels. And then. We may question why does one country have a higher cholesterol level than another. And these are potential. Underlying causes. Well jeffrey rose color. Causes of causes. These are contextual factors these are living conditions. Habits of people. Culture. Political situation economy. Etc these are population level calls us that we need to target. And these cause different patterns in disease for example. The geographic variation in life expectancy. Of course these don't have individual causes. The people in the middle of africa. Do not have a different genetic makeup which makes them have a lower life expectancy than canada and australia. At the high life expectancy levels or. Trends in obesity. As we have witnessed in the united states and everywhere in the world. Are not caused by individual differences. This is nine hundred eighty five we weren't aware of obesity yet so that the. Empty states in united states did not have measurements of obesity and the darkest blue colors. Are ten to fifteen percent. But look at eighty six eighty seven eighty eight nine hundred ninety you see almost all states now have measurements but also. Over half of the states. Have these high prevalence in ninety one. We needed a new category. Nineteen percent. And we see the epidemic. Increasing. Ninety seven. Already. They needed a new color. Over twenty percent. Ninety eight ninety nine two thousand and one. We need a new color again in the same states. They're always ahead. And in two thousand and five the same states. Over thirty percent. This is an epidemic and this is surely not caused by different. Changes in makeup of the population. And exactly the same pattern we see in the prevalence of the i b diabetes. Over the united states. And in the prevalence of. Lower life expectancy. There are red parts have a lower life expectancy than the blue part. And what happens if people move from the red part to the blue part. Well if they adopt. The lifestyle. They may very well. Have a lower risk. As an individual as well. So we shouldn't just look at individual risk factors. And wonder why. These people are different. The disease people are different from the longer sees people. And if we have an epidemic we get more disease people. Why do we get that. And even more people we need medical care. We keep looking at the differences between individuals but we should take a different perspective and look at the context which may cause. That many more people. Need medical care because of disease. And the only way to cure that is to change the context. And bring it back to where we were. For example for obesity in one thousand nine hundred five. And that is what jeffrey rosen as what he means when he says causes of disease patterns. We have an individual versus a population level. It is easy. Comes for expression in an individual. But the causes are in our living conditions. In our society. And in changes in our living conditions. So again. The population strategy. He said asked the key to prevention lies in the system. Underlying the individual causes. It is about contextual. Factors. The question is now population strategies which factors do they switch factors determine the baseline risk and what should be targeted.",

                "text": "So we will talk about. Public health epidemiology and the prevention paradox. What is public health epidemiology. Well. Surprise. This is just. Epidemiology. As brian make men in the first textbook on epidemiology stated it. Epidemiology. Is the basic science. Of public health. It is the study of distribution. And determinants of diseases. In human populations. And it started with. Observations about unequal distribution of the disease within populations. Subgroups of the population or. Across populations. Or even over time. And those. Unequal distributions. Are reflected in regional and temporal patterns of disease. And these may give clues about. Underlying causes. For example this regional pattern. In lung cancer mortality. We all know that this is not caused like differences between. Between these areas. Are not caused by individual biological differences by the fact that people in the united states or in europe or in australia. Would be more sensitive to lung cancer. This is caused by smoking habits no surprise. And the same for temporal patterns first we see the increase in smoking habits for example in the u.s. population. And then. We see this follow twenty year later. By an increase in. Lung cancer mortality. And in china other lung cancer mortality. Came up a bit later. Because they started to smoke. A bit later. So these patterns are not caused by biological differences between individuals. Or by biological changes. But by population level characteristics. On the one hand the smoking prevalence. But very special the underlying societal drivers of the smoking prevalence let me say tell a bit more about that. Or do i mean by that. Well we have individual level causes. Smoking of individuals is likely to be the cause of their own. Lung cancer. Clear. And high lung cancer rates in certain populations like the us western europe australia. Are caused by the smoking prevalence is in the same populations. However the causes of these high smoking prevalence and changes over time. These are determined by societal circumstances. On the population level. The availability of tobacco the advertising the affordability of the people. Taxation social norms is it a good thing or not culture. Legislation. Etc. So we are actually talking about prevention. Targeted. Not only towards the individuals but also towards this of saudi sort of societal circumstances. Which enhance or decrease the smoking habits. And that's a very essential difference. And this is laid out in rows a strategy. Of preventive medicine. Again. The individual. And the population perspective on health. What do i mean by individual perspective. Well. This is business dries much. She was the oldest dutch inhabitant. Until recently. She turned a hundred and nine years old and. She was a heavy smoker. This is what the newspaper said the oldest woman has lungs like smoked meat and there you get the individual perspectives. Because or do we say. Well. My grandma my neighbor. My friend swapped all her life. And she didn't get lung cancer. So i might smoke as well that's the implication. But we need to realize that the probability to turn one hundred nine years. Is much much less in smokers. Then in nonsmokers data. A lifelong frisco lung cancer. In a nonsmoker it's point seven. Percent in a smoker it's twenty times as high it's fourteen percent. So this is the individual perspective. The smoker thinks. If he would know these numbers. He doesn't think actually i have fourteen percent probability for lung cancer. He thinks i have eighty six percent chance. To not get lung cancer. And that is the individual perspective that. All these hundred smokers. Think i have only an eighty six percent chance to get lung cancer. However this is the truth we don't get forty percent lung cancer we get it. We don't get it. So out of one hundred people in the end. We will have fourteen percent. Who will get lung cancer. And that is the problem. For public health that's the problem for the ministry of public health. That is the population perspective on risk. And this has a very interesting paradox to it. Because as we see a small. Absolute risk for the individual. The fourteen percent for the individual may nevertheless have a large impact on population health fourteen percent of the people or. Turn it around. And we can say that a larger risk to population health may be a small risk. To the individual. And what does that mean. We tell people. There is a large problem in the population so do something about it. But we have a small risk. And that is the prevention paradox. Jeffrey rosen. Formulated like this a measure of that brings large benefits to the community. All first little. To each participating individual. And what does that mean. Well. That's why it is so difficult to change an individual's behavior. To tell them to stop smoking. Because yes some people turn one hundred. While they smoke. To tell them to do some physical exercise. To tell them to to quit drinking those big gulps. That is the problem. So in some. Public health. Epidemiology is very much. About widespread exposure. In the population that. Even if it's associated was a small risk for the individual it may still have a large impact on population health. Give one cent. The total population of holland gives one cent to me and i will have sixteen million. Cents. And that's very much money. And population health. Top. Public health epidemiology. Is about causes at the individual. And the population level and. This has many implications for the type of prevention we want to do. The high risk or to population approach. To prevention.",

                "text": "And this clip. I'm going to discuss how to control or inhibits lippitt oxidation in food products. Elaborate. Oxidation is a major deterioration reaction in foods. And it's often. On the side because it's called off. Flavors. Which we call rancidity. Or it's caused a decrease in nutritional value for example. So we want to profound to look at oxidation. Now to prevent lipitor oxidation you should understand what causes lippitt oxidation. A few factors that make fats more sensitive to liquid oxidation. First of all the fatty acid composition. Than secondly how the fat is stuart's. And third whether there is a presence of pro oxidants or anti-oxidants. I will discuss. Each of three these three points now in more detail. Let's start with the fatty acid composition. It's important to understand that pulley unsaturated fatty acids. So fatty acids with many. Double bonds. That there are more sensitive to limit oxidation than for example. Fatty acid but only one double bond or with no double bonds. If you here look at. This fatty acid it has four double bonds. Which makes it much more sensitive to look at oxidation. Than for example then only it acid. Which to double bonds. And it's mainly because. Hydrogen atom and. Between the two double bonds is easier extracted by. For example. An oxygen molecule. Than. The hydrogen here on the site. So the more double bunch you have the more sensitive. The fatty acid. Is to limit oxidation. Then let's talk about the storage conditions. How storage. Conditions influence lippitt oxidation. First of all the oxygen. Contrition. Now you can lower the oxford concentration. And if you lower that then you also reduce limpet oxidation. How can you lord oxygen concentration a man used example is of course you can use of. Vacuum. So here and. These meat products are in a vacuum. Or you can use. Modified atoms for packaging. Meaning that the atmosphere inside the package. So the gases inside the packets has changed. We have changed the normal gases which also contain. Option two gases only taking. Containing nitrogen or. Carbon dioxide. For example. A second source condition is light light often triggers. Photo oxidation which then. Results and to outtalk sedation so. By taking away light. You profound. One of the triggers off look at oxidation. Now how can you prevent a light penetration. By using for example cartons for milk here is an example. You can have milk in a carton or milk and. In a glass bottle or in a plastic bottle where lie can go through the carton will prevent the light from going through. You can also use tens or you can make products that are in glass instead of using. Colorless glass you can also use for example brown glass. Which prevents less more light less light to go through the product. But the third condition. Storage condition. Is temperature. Temperature it when you increase the temperature. Actually most reactions goes faster as a higher temperature and this also is true for limit oxidation. The higher the temperature defat limpid oxidation in general. But there is one downside to that. However the oxidation sole ability in food products. Is low or. At a high temperature. So if we have a high temperature here here's the product. Then you see that there is less oxygen present in the product. At a high temperature. When comparing a product at a low temperature. Then there is more oxygen press and in the product so. Although lippitt oxidation is faster to feel ability off the option is often lower. At a higher temperature. The next. Condition is. Surface area. I'm comparing here for example ground coffee with whole coffee beans. And then the surface area when you. Grind a product the surface area becomes. Comes much larger or this also means that the exposure to. Oxygen becomes much larger. And what you can do to prevent lead off situation is for example store. The coffee beans not in the ground form but in the whole beans. Form. And only grind it at the very end. And then the last condition i want to discuss is what's your activity. Now in general the rule is at the low water activity still blows or point to the fed oxidation can be extremely fast. Also at a high water activity so. Let's see above zero point four. Look at oxidation is relatively high. And between the lip of the oxidation. Is much lower. So when you're between zero point two ins or point four. It all has to do how water influences limpet oxidation. And the high water activity there is a lot of water press and making it easier for molecules to go through to product. While i do a little so. That is why it. It. It increases fat. Oxidation at the low water activity. It has to do more with how much water. Is surrounding. For example. I instead have influence on the lip of oxidation. At the lip it oxidation becomes much faster because there is less water. Present that prevents. The liquid oxidation. Now that was about storage conditions. Now i want to talk about. Accidents and anti-oxidants. We talk about pro accidents. Than these are compounds that similar. Simulate fact oxidation. And it's mainly. Metal ions. We talk about anti-oxidants done these are. Molecules that slow down. Lifted off sedation. And this is mainly by removing radicals. Now here's an example of. Phenolic compound here so you have a. Benzene ring wooden or each group attached to it. And this from the a compound. Can act as an antioxidant. Here's the radical and. This phenolic compound. Can stabilize the radical by giving away its hydrogen here. Given the reach hydrogen. Sudha radical. And then the radical stabilized. It's not a radical anymore. Here. But the phenolic compound itself became a radical. Here you see the radicals. But because it hasn't been seen wring it can stabilize the radical within its structure. Because of the con you gave it system. And saw this molecule now it's much less reactive. Than the radical before. No examples of anti-oxidants. I'm showing you here two structures. Here is a sense that's like and the accidents which is very often added to food. It is also known as b h eight. And you. Again see here just. Phenolic. Structure with the old age group. And a natural anti oxidant here. As for example a tocopherol an alpha tocopherol. It has this long chain. Carbon chain. Which makes that it is solvable in fat. But it also has this. Phenolic. Ring with an o. h. group and. So dish. Molecule here can act as an anti oxidants. So now we've learned a little. About how to prevent lippitt oxidation so let's see if you can answer this question. Which elements in the package of ground coffee. Here you see a packet of it's inside there is ground coffee which. Element of this package prevents slip it so it could be oxidation. Now if you think about what i've just told to you than there are two things that is happening here first of all. Repro fent light. From going through by the aluminum foil that is around to package the linen for oil no light will go through there. Also no oxygen components free through the packaging material so be profound. Oxygen from coming in and light from coming and secondly it's a fake. And so we take away all the air. Out of the product. So there is almost no oxygen press and that can oxidize. Fats that are in the coffee. So the summarized in this knowledge clip i've talked about how to control or inhibit lipitor oxidation. I've discussed sovereign factors that influence. Oxidation. The fatty acid composition. And then the several storage conditions like the amount of oxygen. The amount of light. The temperature. The surface area of the product and the watch activity of the product. And at the end of talked about pro oxidants and. anti-oxidants.",

                "text": "And this knowledge kip. I'm going to talk about. More specifically i'm going to talk about the structure of the second rights. We talk about more the second rights in food than the main one of psych writes her glucose and fructose you see destructors here. But there are several other motorcycle rights. In foods. For example gallic toast man those are of been zero six titles. A many of these monocytes rights are not present as separate from the sec right. But as a monomer. In an illegal cycle ride or in a police record right. For example here i have a die cycle right. Sorts who monomers connected to each other. And it's a glucose. Here. And a freak to us here. And this knowledge clip i'm going to explain you what the difference in structure is of these different monomers. So in this case a glucose and fructose what is the difference between a good cause and effect us. I will explain you to difference. Of the structure of model second rights by a few different properties. I will explain the difference between an elder was in a ketosis. Apartment i was in a for a nose. And hex was an append toes and at the end the difference between an alpha and beta and where. So let's start with the elbow isn't a ketosis. Here you have the strictures of glucose and fructose. Here's a ring structure for expose and the. Open structure. And the open structure of glucose. And the ring structure of glucose. Not for. It's what we call a ketone. And how can you see dad. A ketone has a double bonus option john not on the first but. Always on the second or on the third or. Etc carbon and this case. You see that freaked always has a double bonus option on the second carbon. So it's a key tome. But in the case of sugars to be called a ketosis. When we look at the glucose you see that the double bone the oxygen is on the first carbon. Not the. This molecules and aldehyde but in the case of sugar sweet call that an elder. A few look into restructures those double bonds oxygen's become an age group. In the case of fructose you see the age group here. And in the case of glucose. You see that oh age group. There. How can you add the ring structure weathered molecules an aldehyde or a ketone that me show you that. Here you have the elbows clue close and. Ketosis fricatives. And if we close the ring. Then here is the carbon. That has the double bond with oxygen. We also call that the an american been. And in an america carbon is a carbon. Between two oxygen atoms. So here is the carbon. With the oxygen in the ring. And the oxygen. That was a double bond was oxygen before but it's not one or it's group. Not if there's an america and also has another sea. Rope attached with here this group. Then it means that that carbon. Used to be a key tool. Or not a word. This is how you can see that the ring. Is a ring structure of a ketosis molecule. If there is no extra. Molecule. Attached to it like in this one. Than. This used to be a double bonus optional in the first carbon. So this is an al the height. Now what is the difference between a parent knows an a for an over here you have a glucose molecule. In an open form. And of the ring closes the ring. Can close. As a six members ring or as a five member tiring. You can clearly see here the. One two three four five six members of the ring. Then we call that appear a nose. And when it closed. Says a five member tiring one two three four five. Then the sugar molecule. Is called a firm those what is the difference between a pencil us and a hex source here you see a hex so small a kill and here so you see a pen too small to kill. And all has to do with the number of carbon in the molecule. So if we look at glucose then we see one to three four five six carbons. So this is a hex rose. And when we look at the side. That it has one two three four five carbons. So this is the panto's. Because it has five carbons. And then finally what is the difference between an alpha and a beta and american. I feel look at glucose. Than. When the ring structure opens and closes again. And the double binds oxygen here. Becomes an o. each group. When its the ring is closing. And this age group. After closing can. Point. Don words. Or come point. A port. If the age group. Relatively sudha. Ring structure is pointing downwards. We call that an alpha and where. And if the oic. Age group relative to the ring structure is pointing upwards. We call that the beta glucose. Now did you florent about the different structural properties of monocycle writes we have a few questions for you. First of all here you have a gallic to those molecules. And now. One should to look at it and tell me is this iquitos or an elder. Then also tell me is it a pen toes or a hex. And then here you have a dice cycle. So it's a combination of two monomers connected to each other. There is a glucose unit here on the left. And a freak torch unit here on the right. And i want you to answer a question about the fructose units. So first district ocean of the. A norse or a for a nose. Is it a panto's or a hacksaw and finally. Is it. Elf up. Or a beta and where this last question is not an easy question to answer. So you have to find an american. Bone of the toes it's here. Between the oxygen atoms. And then look at the position of the. O. h. group. So here are the answers. First of all. Gallic toes as an l. those. There is no extra. Group. Attached to it so you can see that. It wasn't aldehyde also it's a hack saw it was because it contains six. Carbons. Then when we look at the fructose unit. Then you can see it so fur a nose. Because it is a five member curing. You can also see that as a hacksaw is because it has six carbons. For it to us. And maybe this last one is not easy to see. Baithak configurator pricked. Molecule. When you look at the glue cause it's easy. Here you have the un-american harben. And then the or. The oregano each group. Is pointing downwards so this is definitely an alpha. Animal or for a look at bit. At the photos you might think it is also an alpha because here. It looks like it's pointing downwards. But you have to look at the animal recording from the right site. And i will show you now in more detail how to look at that. So here you again have this dissect right. You have the glucose units and decide and the frick to shoot it on that site. And if you look at the glucose unit then you have to an american car been here. Between the two. Oxygen atoms. Even now. So you have to put the an american car been on the right side of the molecule. If you know look at where. How to all. Group is precious shuns. Then you see if you put the ring structure flat too you see that it. The original each group is pointing downwards. So this is definitely an alpha. Now let's look at the fructose unit where the animal or a carbon. It's here. Between the also here and all in the ring. Now. We have to look at the an american from the right side so i have to flip the molecule. Now i can figure out whether it's an alpha beta. So the un-american arbonne is on the right side. I have two flats in the structure. And if i do dad now i see dad to all. Group that. It was the o.-h. group. And this. The free from molecule. This group is now pointing upwards. So it's a beta and america. So to summarize. In this knowledge clip. I've discussed the. Rights and structural properties of them want to second rights. They can different between being an elder wizard ketosis already doubled and. Option as positions. They can be either a paranoids or for a nose. So either of the five or six members ring. They can either be a pentodes or hex o's meaning five or six. Glucose carbon atoms. And it could be either an alpha. Or a beta. So meaning the old age group is pointing. The more sort of births. When looking at the ring structure.",

                "text": "My name is to be tested i am a mood to. And i will talk in this shark feed the oakley about issues. For liberty is basically the absence of bias or. Heiress and. Says something about the quality of your study and. We can split it into. Internal facility. And external phonied and internal affiliated to be threatened by. Three major biases but there are more but these and then. The main ones. Selection bias. Information bias and co-founding bias. And in the next couple of slides. I will explain to you what each of these mean. You basically don't want. Systematic differences. To occur in any stage during design if you study analyses and depict a show in our publication. And basically if you get the system at the differences then and through association between exposure. And outcome will be influence. Selection bias means that there's error due to systematic differences in a correct terroristic acts between those people who are in the core. Are maintained in a color during follow up. And those who are not. And one main one is the most a follower. Or attrition bias. And basically what you don't want is that there are differential losses. Of fall of up between those who are expos. Compared to those who are not exposed and. You can imagine if you are a follower. It's longer like five ten twenty years. This type of bias becomes more of a problem because you have more losses. Of follow up during longer time. This figure illustrates very nicely and type. This type of selection bias. You start to discard without people during the fall of a time. And at the end of study you have lost some people but you are left with. Nine eight nine people. And all these arris mean the people who are lost to fall of up. And the d.s. mean the number of. Disease people. And you can see that. There are about seven losses of follow up during. In disco. Or during the time. And if he splits now the cord into the expos group. For example the smoking and the unexposed group the non smoking group. And you can see that. If. If lung cancer will be the disease. That there are more losses to follow up in the. Expos group than in the unexposed group. Yet. You might consider you have selection bias because if the reasons for the last of all of are also related to the xposed. Exposure and outcome. Then you get a selection bias. And that's because this differential. Loss is so full of a teeny expos and. Unexposed group. This classic two by two table again. Gives a nice example of selection bias. You have to bail you assess. Yes and no and. As the exposure. And the disease. Trumbo and malicious and. In the columns and you can see the number of people in their cells and. The true or relative risk between pill use and trauma animalism. Would be about two so use of. Bill would increase your risk of trumbull emilie's him by about a two fault and. If you look in the second two by two table you can see in bolt. The losses. To follow up. And the losses. In the pill. Uses group is twelve. And in the non pill user group is two. So if you would. Recalculate from this data. The relative risk. You will find the relative risk of. One so it will say there is no association between pill use and trauma and this and that was actually on their estimate. True as if risk. Because had you kept all these people in your detente and you would have find a different route a different scale and there are ways of keeping people in the study by flyers by motivating them by giving them incentive for press and or. Letting them come back to the clinic and there are all sorts of ways to keep people in the study. But the chorus. No longer to follow up. You cannot avoid it completely that you have losses to follow and. If you have these kind of. Differential losses to follow up. You need to address. Selection bias. In your results and interpretation of your results and this question. Well. If formation. Bias was the second type of bias. Which i would like to explain to you. Basically when you have a data collection which is differing. It's not the same for the exposure group and the unexposed unexposed group. Then you have information bias. And for example. Yellow fingers is so obvious that you cannot collect it in the same way for the expos and. Unexposed group. And if. If that's your main xplosion of interest in. For example the association with lung cancer. You have information by us. So observer bias is basically when the way of collecting your data is influenced by the observer for obeidi investigated because he knows. Particular information about for example the exposure. Or the outcome. Or demain hypothesis. Of your study which can influence for example. How he collects the data on exposure and i'll go falling for this. You have to really understand this diagram. Confounders are the covariance. You have you measured. In your cohorts that you could influence the relation between exposure. And outcome. So all these error. It's our. Orton. To look at because you want to have. You don't want to have this kind of disturbances you want to say something about a potential cause of disease. But they're always confounders playing a role in this. Exposure outcome that she's where you have to take care of and that can be done in the analysis stage because for example if you want to examine the relation between coffee and lung cancer. Smoking would be a main co-founder. And what you could do then is. Examined the relationship between coffee and lung cancer. In the smokers first. So in a strata of smokers. And then. The strata of non smokers you also examine the relation to. Coffee and lung cancer. So the strad the specific analysis is important and. Yeah you can then also get insight and if the data that is smoking really. Influences their relationship between. Coffee and lung cancer. And also you can pull stratum specific estimates. Another way of dealing with confounders is adjusting for it. In with statistical programs and milty feria. Analysis techniques. But that will come later and more advanced courses. So with confounding you can deal. In the analysis stage so by strata. Or just external fellated t.. All that is really to what extent. The study results of the cold war can be applied to a broader population and. This is the sample. This is your cohort. You cannot have a call for it on a whole city or a whole nation. You know you always have a sample of the population but then. In the end when you have your results you have your association between exposure and outcome. You'll want to say something about a broader population. So for example if we do a study in latin ingin. And so. Association is detected. If you want to say ok is this study this goal or the fatling ari presented to you for the whole often evidence or maybe can we extrapolate our findings not only to the netherlands. But also to europe or maybe the us. So you need to think also about generalized ability issues. If you draw a sample. You have a cold heart. But this it. Then tell you if you have your results of out. A broader population. And one example which is also given in the book. f.t.v. ology book which you have for this course is with social economic status. And the relationship with injury. Let's say families with low so she can omit states which is quite common they're more likely not to participate in your study then you have a under repression taishan of this group. In the told local boards so basically the measurement of injury or outcome. Within the low so she can omit status group. And a comparison. In their height so she can only status group. That should still be accurate. But you just have a very low. So she cannot make state this group. It's smaller than. If you had all the low. So she could not be status families. In your cohorts. So let's say the assumption is that the low so she cannot make. Status families who refused to participate also have a higher risk of injury so they're high risk. A high risk group. Then. In your study. But you don't have these people. You would. Underestimate the effects of low. s.e.s.. On the injury risk. Actually in terms of. Extrapolating then the findings from this cohort. To broader populations yeah. You get into trouble. Because you don't find it through a situation. Your sample is selective. And yet. You have to be careful how you do and.",

                "text": "My name is seventy to sudan i'm want to know if you a shark feeding. About. Coverts that. The first slide shows you to design offical words thirty. You start with a defined population. I need to fight them first into. Exposed and. Unexposed. And that's this could be for example smoking is exposed and unexposed is no smoking or heifetz and indeed levels is exposed. And you know if it's him indeed levels. It's not exposed. And the time is very important in cold studies. You need to follow. These two groups. For for some time and then see how many people develop the disease and how many don't and in both groups. You would come back and the number of disease people. Other words off referring to gold studies because it's a prospect if with the time factor. It's also a follow up study incidence. When you tune in a study. Or are the most common used term prospect difficult word study. A ko artist really essentially a group of people who share common characteristics. So in the lecture theatre there are also a lot of students that could be also a call or. Of students. But they're also very common a ways off. Naming culverts that eases ita by. G'kar traffic or area. By occupation. By the birthday date of birth via facial characteristics or eye risk groups and. Just so make samples a geographical core which is very famous is the framing and study which had an area in america. Just that's been study in the netherlands is. Place called sirtf and. So that is a goal or to write a geography to the the find the name of the current occupation all courts which are in. Art and. These are for example the nurses' health study where nurses were the main occupation. And the health professionals follow up study which are also by the occupation. And decide it's one of the patient group. Examples is the type one diabetes goal or the euro diet. Perspective. Complications thing. The main purpose of course studies to study. Each year logical factors. The purpose is to identify potential costs of the seas and their requirement is that people aren't. They don't have the disease at the beginning. For example of it. Smoking and lung cancer. You want to have people without lung cancer in the beginning. Then you want to have a group who smallpox and a group who doesn't smoke. And you followed them up till they defect of lung cancer and. The advantage of this the sign is that exposure shoots. Be receding the outcome so it should be placed before the outcome. The feds. Broke gnostic fact this can also be studied but then. Your goal or it is not a group of people. Without a disease. No. They have already a disease. For example that the type one diabetes. You can follow them for nephrotic teaches kidney disease over five or ten years. And then the. Prognostic fecht this or predict this off. Kidney disease. Could be something like a new biomarker or cholesterol or blood pressure. In the patients a type one diabetes. What do you measure in cord studies you measure the exposure status because that's the most important factor in your study for example if smoking is. Is of interest then you develop a questionnaire as you collect information on a number of cigarettes are bad and they stop smoking and then they say. Up smoking. If you will have obesity as your main exposure. Then you would like maybe to measure and a body weight and height. And then calculate body mass index. And covariates are also factors which could influence the disease already outcome and. In your study. So all the other variants what you need to measure next to the exposure status. Are for example body weight or cholesterol or blood pressure and an example record of escuela disease or diabetes would be important. During the follow up. That could be either two years or one year or five years or ten years. You develop people you want to see people developing the disease so you need to measure. Also the disease and it could be done by. Registry by hospital records by asking people. By asking doctors so all sorts of ways you could collect this information. And you need to. You can update information on exposure and. Covariates is a process go forward study go out study always prospect if you know it can also be a wreath respective. And it really depends on the timing of your day to connec. Connection. So if you have a prospect of course that he reaches the more common type. You use the baseline date at the start of the study. You split the people into. Exposed. And non-exposed and follow them all up for disease. If you look more historical you start from the disease. And look back in the records what was the exposure. And one example is for example the nurses' health study where they assessed diabetes now and wanted to know the effect on the association of birth weight. In these weight the women. And they they they looked back in the medical records. Where where did the birth rates of the. These women. And the find the people into high and low birth rates and then looked at better diabetes was associated with birth. One advantage of both the science. Is that assessment of the exposure. Proceeds the outcome. So in vote. Study decides you. Measured exposure before. You defend the disease. And this scheme actually gives also. What i just said with the examples. You start in a prospect of course id now. You define your exposure and your people are not exposed you followed them till they develop the disease. And a historical cohort or read the spec to design. You start. Now with the disease. And you look back at what was the exposure. And he can go in both directions with coord studies. The time is very important and go and studies and. That you start with people who don't have to disease in the beginning. And then. During that time you can see these triangles are all. People. You imagine them as people and. When they become red. That means they get the disease. So to red triangles. Which are actually getting more and more during the time. Mean that there is more. Occurrence of the disease and that is in epidemiology good terms called. The incidence. So what do you do in court studies. You want to know did. Relationship between exposure. And disease. So you need to count a number of the cities. Not only in the total car. But. But also in the x. post. And the unexposed group. So that's shown on this slight. Where you basically count the number of. Disease. The red triangles. In the exposed group. And you do that the same thing. In the unexposed group. And what you don't get is the incidence in the expos. Scroope and the incident. In the unexposed group. And if you defied. Those two of each other you get a relative risk or an incidence rate ratio or incidence proportion ratio. And they all actually mean the same thing. It's just the rates interpreted is the same thing and a way calculated it really depends on the denominator because within proportion. You have a total number of people. This is the main in the denominator. Everything rate. Ratio. The person years are the time becomes important and that's the main the term and. So to show you an example of how to calculate the relative risk. To the classic two by two table. In epidemiology is used to to look at the association between an expo share and an outcome in this case. Alcohol is the exposure alcohol and no alcohol. Consumers. And cardiovascular disease c.b.d.. Is the outcome. And that's in the column speak for half the disease or don't have the disease. And the numbers. Given in the cells are basically the number of people in the alcohol group. The fell of ten people. Cardiovascular disease and whole. Hundred did not. And in the non alcohol consumer groups fifteen people developed kind of rescues ease and eighty five did not. So the relative risk or the incidence proportion ratio would be.",

                "text": "I know my name is say on the lead i am. And i'm going to present through this clip. About prevention in public health. Actually i'm going to present to two models. And the first model is defined by coupling school the couple's prevention a model it's already a bit old from one nine hundred sixty four bits. Firmly. If you look in the literature and in documents you will come across these terms so it's good. If you know. The terms that he used. Generally he. Divides prevention into three levels. On the first level. It's called primary prevention. This focuses on. General prevention. In public and aims at avoiding the development of any disease. For example type two diabetes by. Encouraging people to eat healthy and. To exercise enough. That's for the general public. Then on the second level the distinguish is secondary prevention. And that's its focus on. Early detection of a health problem. So that something can be done about its. Progression. And symptoms can be avoided it's so for example that would be. The diagnosis of type two diabetes. So that people can. You know work on their health change their behavior. So that their diabetes is not getting worse. And then. Dear. The top level. Is focusing on the very small part of the population. That's focused on the people who have already develops the does. The disease. And that's focuses on the reduction of complications of the severity of symptoms. And it's almost moving into the care. Of a disease. Then another model is. Developed by gordon. Actually somehow taking a similar approach and. Going from. Population level to individual level. And from healthy. To the zs level. He makes a distinction between. Four different levels and the first level is universal prevention is actually the same as primary prevention. Focusing on the toes of population. Then selective prevention. Focusing on higher risk groups. Then indicates it's prevention. Focusing on. Early diagnosis and. The last level is carriers of prevention. Focusing on these least persons you will see some similarities between. The first model. And this one. So there's some examples. For this model. If you look at universal prevention. That's could be sport and food lessons at school. For example to help children to exercise more and what you tell think. Then selective prevention. Would be. Sports facilities at schools in. Deprived neighborhoods. Because people in deprived. Neighborhoods have more. Risk of a lifestyle that is not healthy. Then the next level it's. Indicates it's. Prevention. Focusing on. Early diagnosis and an intervention could be a course for people who have. Overweight. And then. The last level is care related prevention. And it's good be. Surgery or providing medication to people who have a certain disease. So in this clip you have learns about two models. Focusing on prevention levels. Which are somehow the same. But the second model. Is more developed than the first. Thank you.",

                "text": "The number needed to treat. Is a typical. Outcome used in clinical epidemiology. Nutritional e.p.d. me ology we don't use it so much. But it is important when interpretive. Papers on clinical trials. What we mean with the number needed to treat is a number of patients. Who would have to be given the experimental treatment. The terrapins in order to prevent one. Case one adverse event for example that. Of or complication from occurring. So usually we calculate the number needed to treat as. One divided by. The absolute risk reduction. And i come back to that later. There's also something which is called. Number needed to harm. And this is in the opposite case when we talk about an experimental terra p. which has some and that wanted side effects. For example. And then. We call it like this. What we do is that we go to the famous two by two table but then for the clinical trial. So we have an intervention group. And we have a placebo group. The treatments. And the outcomes. They are yes. A certain disease or know. A certain disease. So when we look at the first row here we look at the intervention group. We have a number of people who develop this disease. In the intervention. And or risk. The incidence. Is a divided by the total population in the intervention. Group. A plus b.. In the control group similarly also we have incidence of the disease which is c. divided by the total number in the in the control group which is c. plus d.. Now what we call the absolute risk reduction. A r r. Is the same as what is put in the literature as. Attributable risk. Or risk. Difference. R.d. which i prefer personally. Which is the difference in risk. Incidence between the. Group. And the treatment group. Now you should realize. The size of this depends very much on the baseline risk. The baseline risk of disease for example in your control group. And this can vary quite a lot between populations. So where treatment may lead to work. A big amount of people with less disease. In one situation compared to another. Now the number needed to treat is something we use some things to sometimes to discuss with patients when they have to decide about a certain terror peak. So it's the number of patients who need to be treated. To prevent one. Adverse events or one. Disease case. Here. And that is one. Divided by the attribute of the risk reduction or risk. Difference. This is a little bit teary and i think it's good to have an example so we made an example and it's from literature it's not made up. It's from a group who did a lot on the reduction on the c.r.p.. And the effect of statens which is nowadays the mostly used. Medication for reducing l.d.l. cholesterol. And they wondered whether also people with low l.d.l. would benefit. When they had high c.r.p. because it's suspected as the statens also reduce c r p. So they had a nice. Well done r.c.t.. About nine thousand in the intervention group and a similar number in the placebo group. All double blind. One hundred forty two. Starting uses developed m.r.i. during five years followup and five two hundred fifty one. In the placebo group. So the absolute risk reduction or risk difference. Is the incidence. And the incidence of two point eight percent. I calculated from. Two five one. Cases divided by. Eight nine. All one. In the total population in the placebo arm. So this is an incidence of two point eight percent. A likewise this is an incidence of one point six percent. And given us a rick. Risk reduction of. One point two percent or twelve thousand. Now what would be done in this case the number needed to treat. What we call the inverse. One divided by this risk reduction. One point two percent. Is eighty three. What does it mean. We should treat. Eighty three patients with low l.d.l. high c.r.p.. To prevent one case. Of mild cargo. In function. In this type of populations. Is this a lot. This is not a lot. Well that really depends on the context. And of course also on the cost of the medication etc etc. That's not the purpose of this clip. This clip is just to illustrate the calculation of number needed to treat.",

                "text": "Here we like to explain to you. The use of the rock. Curve. And we're still dealing with the accuracy of diagnostic tests. And ideally the test. In diagnosis really perfectly separates two groups of patients and non patients as you see here with cancer and non-cancer. Based for example on a certain threshold. I mean remember we do this often in daily practice. Because we decide who has hypertension. Based on blood pressure measurement. Which is a continuous variable with a certain distribution. And for diabetes we use the glucose levels. As a continuous marker and at certain threshold. We decide someone has diabetes or not. So ideally. The sensitivity in the specificity are high. One hundred percent or. If expressed as a probability here of being test positive when the disease is present. A probability of one is down the maximum. And again for specificity it's to say. The probability of being test negative. When you don't have the disease. Is one. In the ideal situation. But like i said a situation like this. Almost never occur as they usually we have something like this. Overlapping distributions of our blood pressure or glucose levels. In people without the disease. And people with the disease. And we have to decide and agree upon some sort and trash old. To decide which one has the disease or not. And you can see that. If we give the. Level. A higher value. It shifted to the right. We have less false positives. Which is nice but we also have less true positives. Which is a pity. And the other side. When we go down. We have less false negatives but also less true negatives. So this is again. The specificity. Sensitivity. Debate so to speak and trade off we need to make. This is not easy but we are now have to receive our operating correctly stick. Curve. Our o.c. curve. Which was actually first developed in the second world war by the army. To detect signals for example from submarines in the ocean. And to decide to which is a submarine. Or which is a whale. For example. Nowadays we use it to compare the accuracy of diagnostic tests. And it can also be used to determine the optimal cutoff point. In case of absence of a gold standard. And for example for hypertension or diabetes we don't have very good. Gold standards. Because we cannot go inside a body. And really assess the hypertension non-invasively. The cup not curves looks like this on the right hand side. And it is a plot of the sensitivity. On the y. axis you see here the true positives. Against. One minus the specificity only expects is. And one minus a specificity is if you specify. As this pacifistic. Specificity is a probability. Or here in the example we have one hundred minus specificity. If the specificity is expressed as a proportion or a percentage. So the marker for generally looks like disease. And what we say about accuracy is that we define it using the area on the does. Rock. Curve. And in this way we can compare various tests. So you see this in our example. When you have an excellent. Test it looks like the yellow. Curve. And we'd like to have it. This corner. Up to the left hand side close to one. With a very high sensitivity inventive. Very high specificity. On the other hand if you just flip a coin you get a line like this. And the area under the curve is then fifty percent. But that's a really useless test. Because the specificity and sensitivity both are fifty percent of that case. Which is very non ideal in a clinical situation. And usually we have something like this like the purple curve. When the area around a curve is around zero point seven zero point eight for example. So this is not bad. Like i said we also use this curves for determining the trash old level. And when you look at the yellow line for example we and we would assume it's for example blood pressure and hypertension we can say is the optimal cutoff point. We'd like to be as close. In the corner. As we could be. Because that is the level with highest specificity and. Highest sensitivity. I hope you understand a rock curve a little bit better now. And you. Now know how to interpret it.",

                "text": "An important part of the ecu a sea of diagnostic test. Is the predictive value. Because the test. Director mistakes like sensitivity and specificity. Are more list fixed for a test. The predictive value. In a population. Depends on the population as we will illustrate now. Predictive fell use we have in two types a positive one. The probability of disease. In a patient with a positive test result. And that's what we like to know in practice of course. And the negative predictive value. The probability that the patient does not have the disease. With a negative test result. Here we see our two by two table again of the pregnant ladies. With their pregnancy tests. And we see here the positive predictive value. Which can be calculated. Following the four hundred seventy three. True positive women. Divided by to four hundred eighty. Women which were all. Positive on the test. Gives us a positive predictive value of ninety eight point five percent. You can see it here. It's a divided by a plus b.. Similarly to negative predictive value is the number of women that are truly negative. To four hundred ninety three. Defied by all that were tested negative. Five hundred twenty. Give us a negative predictive value of. Ninety four point eight percent. And in this case it's d.. Divided by c. plus the. Ninety four point eight percent. The predictive value. Depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the test. That is clear. But it also depends on the prevalence of the seas. In the population being tested. And this is a very important topic. In practice. We showed this with this example. Again we look at pregnant women in a general population and. It seems that. Only fifty of them are really pregnant. But before we knew that we tested them and we had to test positive and test negative once. And we used the same instrument. Now we see here. Forty six out of the fifty. Real pregnant. Were really truly positive. So to sensitivity. Forty sixty five and by fifty. It's ninety two percent. About similar than in the previous example when we had five hundred. Pregnant women and five hundred not pregnant women. The specificity you can calculate yourself. Is obviously the nine hundred ten twenty. Divided by the nine hundred and fifty. Which gives. Ninety seven percent. Again. High as in a previous example. But now the positive predictive value. Remember it's the true positives. Forty six. Defied by. All women tested positive. In this case. Gives us only sixty one percent while we had over ninety percent or over ninety five percent in our previous example. And this case it indicates that forty nine percent of the women tested positive for false positives. Finally the negative predictive value. Is the nine hundred and twenty women here. The five had by all the women tested negative. Nine hundred twenty four. Gives us ninety nine percent. Very high. But like we said before it is positive predictive value really depends on. Not only on sensitivity and specificity of it especially on the prevalence of a disease in a population. And of course pregnancy is not really a disease. If the prevalence is load a positive predictive value. May be very low and this is important to remember because if you think about screening. And you'd like to screen for a disease which is not very prevalent. Although the message can be very good high sensitivity high specificity. The positive predictive value still can be very low. Which makes it not feasible to do this in practice.",

                "text": "I'd like to tell you something about the accuracy of a diagnostic test. Because we'd like to have a to switch is accurate because it should measure. What we'd like to measure. And sensitivity and specificity are important parts of this. Of the test quality. So why do we do diagnostic testing. Well. Obviously to confirm the diagnosis. In our patients. They are suggested by just symptoms but we like to be sure. And this is he's can either be present or not present. And the result of the test can either be positive or negative. This gives us this two by two table. We have to did sees present or absent and the test results. So we have true positive results and true negative results. Green. And we'd like them to be as high as possible. But also false negative. And false positive ones and of course they should be as low as possible. First we talk about the sensitivity of a test. This is an aspect of the test quality of the says something about the probability of a positive test. Given the fact that the patient has the disease. So it's the number of people who are true positives. Divided by the number of people with the decease. And this is an example from a a pregnancy test. An interesting example from certain population groups. We have five on the pregnant women. And five hundred non-pregnant women. And we do this test. And this is the result. We have four hundred seventy three true positives. Divided by five hundred with the decease. Gives us a sensitivity of ninety four point six percent. You see that here. And you see that here in terms of the formula. A divided by a plus. So to sensitivity is about the. True positives. How about the true negatives. Well. That's what we call the specificity. We'd like to be that is highest possible. So the number of people who are truly negative. Divided by the number of people without a disease gives us a proportion which is called the specificity. The probability of a negative test result given that the patient. Does not have the disease. This is in this light. In our case it's four hundred ninety three divided by five hundred. Gives us. Ninety eight point six percent. Or in this formula. Be divided by. B. plus d. d.. Divided by billy d. as cues me. Gives us. Ninety eight point six percent. Here we see here. Another test. This be so fest a we already discussed. But now let's look at another test. The same sample of women in metallurgical study. And we have a more fancy test. For example test b.. And the results are here on the right hand side. You see here if you look at sensitivity and specificity some different numbers. The sensitivity you can verify yourself. For fifty five divided by five hundred. Is ninety one percent. And the specificity. For ninety eight divided by five hundred ninety nine point six percent. So sensitivity a little bit lower. Specificity a little bit as you can see here. So then the interesting question. What is the best test. And this is not easy to answer but it depends completely on the context you're talking about. Because what we always see you have to make a tradeoff between the sensitivity and specificity. And in our case. You could think about would you rather miss a few true positives. Which is test b. because it has a lower sensitivity and. A higher specificity. So few true positives or incorrectly identify people as pregnant while they are not pregnant. As in test. Eight. So far single dikembe. Test the sensitivity and specificity vary with a trend that is being used. And this also impacts the results on sensitivity and specificity but also on thought of test directory sticks which we'll discuss. In an audio clip.",

                "text": "In this clip. We want to tell you something about risk factors for diabetes. And especially type two diabetes. Which is the most frequent. Type of diabetes. We talk about not modifiable risk factors first age. We see a higher prevalence with increasing age and. A positive family history. If you have a family member or a parent for example with type two diabetes. Your own risk is two to four times higher than. If you don't have a first degree relative with diabetes. And nowadays we have lots of molecular studies. Going on and trying to find the genes which are was found civil for diabetes. But so far we can only explain five to ten percent of the occurrence of diabetes. Through genetics. So the most important one for prevention are to modifiable risk factors. Overweight physical activity and diet. But also smoking and alcohol. And also think. At some other factors which are modifiable but not always by yourself. The social environment and. Your birth weight i had of being too high or too low. So you see he had to scheme of the etiology of type two diabetes that you see here that we think about. Early life events which may be a risk factor. But also what happens later in life. Obesity physical activity. Age. An unhealthy diet. Developing into in resistance and. Impaired lugol's tolerance to impaired glucose tolerance. Which is a risk factor for type two diabetes. We look at risk factors through cold war. Studies. Prospective studies. And this is. This is a big one the nurses' health study from harvard in washington. And you see here the risk of type two diabetes. The incidence of type two diabetes during follow up in the nurses. According to their baseline b.m.i.. So you. We took here in a reference group a b.m.i. of twenty three or lower. And you see a very steep. Keep. Increase. Up to a relative risk of. Almost forty. In women who have a b.m.i. of thirty five. And higher. So a relative risk for developing type two diabetes. Compared to ones. With a normal. Two low b.m.i.. You see here. Other risk factors oughta modifiable risk factors for diabetes in the same study. What you immediately see is that the relative risks are much lower. So to ranges clearly not as big as for b.m.i. but you see here that with in diet score with better diet. The risk goes down with more activity your risk goes dong. With more smoking. The risk. Goes up and would alcohol there is seems to be a leveling off. At moderate alcohol intake. Risk is lower than if you don't drink at all but. For high. Really high intakes. Outside this population. The risk is again. Higher. If you're interested in diet. The diet score of distante you can look at this slight. Cereal fiber. And the ratio of polian said traded fatty acids to separated fatty acids are inversely associated with a risk. And you see higher risk. With increasing. Trans fatty acid. Intake and a glycaemic load which is a combination of glycaemic index and carbohydrate intake. And these are the detailed results of the study. At that time the study was reported in two thousand and one. The conclusion for w.h.o. or us follows we have convincing evidence for that weight loss. And physical activity decrease the risk of type two diabetes and. On the other side. Overweight. Abdominal obesity. In activity. But also maternal diabetes. Increased the risk. Some less evidence but. Considered probable. Was that fiber was protective. And that sex rated fatty acids. Would be a risk factors. And also to ensure you drive growth we did ation the low birthweight or barker hypothesis. These factors were considered to be only. With a small level of evidence. And also note that nowadays we also look into coffee and tea and pollie phenols all of oil notch. And some hurts like a cuckoo min. But the evidence is not that strong yet. Although for coffee. The it could be read article studies. Are quite convincingly show that with increased coffee intake. The incidence of diabetes goes down. The nurses' health study in two thousand and one also looked at combinations of. Risk factors and that is very interesting. You see here three factors in the low risk category. Diet score in the upper to quantize. So that meaning a healthy diet. A body mass index below twenty five. And moderate to figure this exercise. You see here. A relative risk of zero point. Twelve compared to those who were in the worst levels of these risk factors. And if you have all five combined with non smoking and moderate alcohol intake. You have a relative risk of old nine. Which gives you a population attribute of the risk. Ninety one percent what does this mean to your right to plea. Ninety one percent of the instant cases of diabetes could be prevented. But this is off of facial. Is there evidence from trials yes there is some evidence for. Randomized controlled trials. This is a summary of some of them and i included this because also one of our own studies. Is part of this systematic review. What we did this we took subjects with i.t.t.. To have a higher risk of developing diabetes. And we put him into were a six year intervention regarding diet and physical activity. And the diet was just the recommended diet. Guidelines for a healthy diet for the nederlands aiming at weight reduction. But also at this diet composition. Dietary counseling with a trained dietitian was once in three months. At the same time. Also to people were stimulated to improve their daily activity. And they had free access to two. To twice a week a supervised exercise session. For at least one hour a week. And we had insurance training and resistance training because that's good for your intern in with distance. And additionally. We had the counseling every three months. And this is our data here the slim study you can see it here. And you see here the incidence of diabetes during the six year study is considerably lower in the intervention group. Eighteen percent compared to the thirty two percent. In the control group. And this is quite similar to this large reduction. To for example the docking study which was the first study a chinese study. But we also see here the d.p.p. in united states. A much bigger study showing a very impressive effect. And the d.p.'s study the diabetes prevention study in finland. Also showing it a massive in fact. And more recent studies. In india japan but also sweden show some impact. So overall this shows that. Yes. Prevention of diabetes is possible. Actually only through lifestyle. Because this is a nice result for the you. From the u.s. d.p.p.. It took again. Three thousand people with i.g.b.t. and randomised them. For a placebo treatment. The combined lifestyle intervention i explained before. But also to metformin which is a medicine to treat diabetes. And you see here. The blue line lifestyle. Did the best. The diabetes incidence was lowest. Even lower than for the med for me. So this is the first time that compared head to head. Lifestyle. First medication lifestyle. Did much better than the medication alone. So in short i hope you now. Know a little bit more about a modifiable risk factors for diabetes because they are important for prevention. But also don't forget the non modifiable ones because these are the. Populations in the population we are at highest risk.",

                "text": "I know. This time. I'd like to tell you a little bit more about. Incidence and prevalence of diabetes. And especially type two diabetes. The idea if the international diabetes federation recently published in two thousand and thirteen. The world atlas of diabetes and this is a very nice graph it's full of nice graphs actually. It shows that. We expect now to have three hundred eighty two million people living on the world. With type two diabetes. Or rich. Forty six percent is not diagnosed as such. So to have high blood glucose levels but they don't know what this means that. About two hundred two hundred ten million patients are registered. You see also the various numbers of people with diabetes. In the various compliments and a staggering number of course. In southeast asia. And especially also in the pacific. The western pacific for example. When you go back to the netherlands our own country we know that we have about eight hundred thousand patients. Register or created by their g.p.. And in addition we estimate that we have two hundred thousand people with. Elevated blood glucose levels in the diabetes range but not diagnosed as sex. Which is a pity because even if you don't have it diagnosed. You have a higher risk of complications. So this high level of. Undiagnosed as in the various parts of the world. Are an important public health problem. We don't look at the total number but at the preference in proportions. In percentage of diabetes. You can again seeing here that we have a high prevalence here in north of north america united states and mexico for example. And also here in the middle east. And also on the right hand side into the western pacific. I just showed you this light because obesity is a very important risk factor for type two diabetes. And you're seeing the data from w.h.o.. Illustrating the prevalence of obesity. All over the world and you see a nice coincidence in various of these countries. If you look at incidence which is the number of new patients diagnosed per year the i.d.f. expert is estimating this to be six million. Of which ninety percent have type two diabetes or even more very recently in you know us in the united states of america. Some calculations were done showing that forty percent of the people will develop. Type two diabetes during their lifetime. So the lifetime cumulative incidence in the us. Is currently forty percent. Which is very high overall life expectancy of a diabetes patient is reduced. Compared to someone who was not diabetes. With about forty five six years. And finally the i.d.f. has reported that. Almost three million of deaths were caused in the year two thousand for example by diabetes. And of course this is higher now. So does data give you a flavor of the importance. And the health care burden of diabetes. When we look at the providence. We see that as steeply increases with age. And that the two slides are both are from the netherlands and are in dutch. We apologize. But i think you can see the age groups which are quite similar. And you see here this is the prevalence pair one thousand. And you see it steeply increases with age. To work a prevalence of about twenty percent. Two hundred or one thousand. In seventy plus. Direct on other women. The blue ones are the men. And you see in all the middle age there's a some predominance of male patients. And later the women catch up. Especially after menopause. On the right hand side you see the incidence and almost a similar pattern. But you see the incidence somewhat higher in men than women. And to show you that the netherlands is not specific in this case we see for example here the prevalence in canada. Again showing a similar increase with age. So when comparing. Patient groups or group. Groups in the population it's important to adjust for age. And you see here. Age adjusted prevalence in the united states. And they were able to go back to nine hundred eighty. Until two thousand and eleven. And you see here. Adjusted for age. A steep increase in prevalence and this is seen almost everywhere in the world. But the specially in the united states it's well documented. And it's well documented. To correlate with the increase in obesity. Another interesting one is to see that the. The ethnic minorities. May are be at an increased risk. So you see here. The white male and white females. Blue and red. Are here the lowest ones. But to see here for the black americans there was quite higher prevalence. Already in the eighty's. And it's up to ten percent. Now in recent years. So i think ethnicity social economic class are important determine what is now. Projected for the future the idea. Has made this projection so we were at three hundred eighty two million people living with diabetes now. And we are expecting that in two thousand and thirty five this is increase with fifty five percent to almost six million. Unfortunately when you see here. That this increase. Varies a little bit. Across the area. And in europe. We are quite lucky because we only will increase twenty two percent. But in the western pacific we see this here. A big number. Even increasing by almost fifty percent. But the highest. Increase is expected to occur in africa. One hundred. More than one hundred percent. Thank you.",

                "text": "Hello my name is edith fess concert and. Today i'm going to tell you a little bit more about diabetes mellitus. An important quantock disease which is on the rise globally. In fact we have more or less like would say. Three types of diabetes. The major one is type two diabetes but first i'd like to tell you a little bit about. Type one diabetes which is about five percent of the diabetes globally. It's an auto immune disease. Not so much to do with nutrition. Your body make antibodies against to beat a cell in your pancreas. Which means that in the end no insulin is produced. It usually develops already during childhood. And patients require. Incident and change their life long. Talk to diabetes is a major form of ninety percent of the diabetes patients have to form. It's a myth a bollock disease. And it's characterized by hypoglycemia and also disturbed. Lippert metabolism. It usually occurs in adult hood. And the treatment usually starts with lifestyle and later took just ational. Diabetes is related to type two diabetes and of course. The name it says. It occurs. Firstly. During pregnancy or i would say it's first diagnosed in pregnancy or women with just a shell. Diabetes. Frequently develop type two diabetes. Later in life. Diabetes is a. Not an easy disease. It's metabolic. But the complications or. The complications can be in the large vessels. The macro fescue or complications. Or in the smaller vessels the microvascular complications. A major one is hard to seize. Seventy five percent of the diabetic patients develop this. Microvascular and often mile cardio infarction. And hypertension. But also stroke is an important complication. And you should realize that. Vascular dementia is an important complication in the elderly. Also peripheral vascular disease occurs which is the intermittent claudication. And finally this may also lead to some food problems. And diabetes is the most frequent course of m. potations in the smaller vessels the microphones can or it's directed not party which occurs quite frequently. Which left untreated may cause blindness. And a rental dc's which may left untreated. May cause kidney failure and later on dialysis for treatment. Neuropathy. Is a complication which is the more diverse one. But may also lead to the food problems and later amputations often seen in. Untreated diabetics. Here you see an overview of the it's a logic. Types and the various stages. And i'd like to. Especially discuss with you dissuasion impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose. You see this here. On the right hand side. You see your graph and this see what happens with your glucose levels. In the blood. After you eat a meal. If you look at the blue curve you see what happens in a normal glycaemic person. The fasting level is tightly controlled. Because your brain needs to glucose order wise it cannot function. You see a small increase. After your meal. And then a decline. What happens with a diabetic person who is injured in resistant and doesn't have enough insulin you see the green curve. It's already higher fasting and after a meal. Is a massive increase in a slow decline. But you also see the red curve and that's the intermediate group we call that pre-diabetes because these people are the higher risk of developing type two diabetes later. And we have two diagnostic criteria. I know based on fasting. Impaired fasting glucose level. Which is the i.f.t.. Impaired fasting hyperglycemia. Are based on what. We call a glucose tolerance test so we give a person seventy five grams of glucose. And we measure fasting and. Two hours after this low. How high did glucose level is. And in disarranged. We are talking about. Impaired glucose tolerance. So pre-diabetes. There are important trends in diabetes screening and diagnosis to discuss. In the old days we had this meet your read. And actually the name diabetes mellitus is named after that. Because if you have diabetes. The glucose is excrete in the arena. Of course later we started measuring glucose levels which was a little old. Already a little bit more precise. And more recently in especially an epidemiologist we used the glucose tolerance test. But nowadays and especially for checking diabetes patients we look at the age be a one c. which stands for black oscillated. Hemoglobin. It reflects the glycaemic control over the past six weeks. And very recently also diagnostic criteria for type two diabetes. Were being based on this. Age be a one c.. Although it's maybe not ideal. In different countries in the western world it's easily being measured. But the measurement is still quite expensive. However these various screening methods also lead to. Quite some confusion as you can see here this is an example of the united states and hang steady. And you see here the prevalence of diabetes according to the various screening methods. If we only use that to our glucose level the prevalence would be four point nine percent. If you would choose. Only to fasting glucose levels it would however only be two point five. And if you would only use. H b a one c. criteria. We only would fund. Find one point six percent of the people with type two diabetes. And you see also that some people have all three criteria. One point two percent. Some have only two or two criteria. And there are quite some for example this one zero point three percent. Only have elevated age be a one seat. But normal fasting and normal two hour glucose. So make sure when you start reading about diabetes or about. Thinking about doing your own study about diabetes. That you think about his screening method carefully. The glucose in the body is tightly regulated as i said. The brain is the soul it's the sole source of energy for differing. So we eat the carbohydrates so we see here the intestine and also other organs are very important for the glucose regulation. We see here the veins where the glucose is circulating in the body. We have he had a pancreas where the incident is secreted. We have here the liver. Where the result of the glucose is metabolized or. Is it stored as glycogen. We see the muscles here. The muscles use most of our glucose levels. And of course if we eat too much. The excess of glucose is stored as fat in the at people sides. On the right hand side of the screen. You also see here that. Various enzymes are involved in the glucose metabolism. And this is important to realize because nowadays they are the newer targets for the drugs for treatment. Here you see a simplified graph of how we sing the etiology if. So somehow it starts with some genetic susceptibility or some other things. And especially in the city is important. Which leads to a state of insulin resistance in the body. Where the cells. Don't take up the. Glucose enough. So we get higher glucose levels like this i.g. t. situation. And the pancreas responds by secrete in more and more insulin. So we have hyperinsulinemia. At that time. But when the beat a cell gets exposed to it as we see here. Finally. Type two diabetes develops. And then. What about treatment. Well of course. As you see the complications to chronic comp. Cations have very much to do with glucose levels. So our primary goal is to bring the glucose levels. Down to normal. We start usually with lifestyle. And weight loss is very important. About eighty percent of the patients with type two diabetes. Have overweight or obese city. And weight loss of course is achieved by increasing. Physical activity. And dietary modification. If this fails then. Drug therapy is warranted. And are farias types of tablets now which can be used. And if this is failed and these cases. Occurs specially if there is a high genetic predicted. A depletion. Intern and injections are a form of treatment which is used most often. So in summary. We hope this shows you a little bit about the different types of diabetes and the etiology. And also the importance of the complications for the diabetes patient. Thank you.",

                "text": "And this knowledge. That i'm going to talk about the analysis of flip it says or actually i'm going to talk about. About two different analysis first of all. I'm going to talk about the total fat content. And then secondly i will discuss the. Fatty acid composition how you end a life that not affect the as its composition tell shoe. The amount of saturated it's. Mono unsaturated and pulley unsaturated fatty acids that you can find in your food product. That start with the first one. Total fats concepts. To analyze the fat content in your food product. Often first what you have to do is to grind your food. Here you see an example of that are grinded and to a meal that that is a very fine. Now why do we do testify do you first do to grinding. Its may need to a large surface. Soledad. And it's it. It's more a sas a bull the to the soul food and. So the lip it's come these all fall into the solvent. Also to break cells if there are cells in the food product then you need to break those cells to free up the fat. And then the next step is to get the fat. Out of the food products. And this is often done by stocks not the extraction. So what you do issue at a sole from two to four product and then the. Fat dissolves. Out of the food product into the soulful and. Now it sucks let the extraction this process is done very efficiently. Your usual self and multiple times. To really take out all the fat. Out of the food product that. After starts like the extraction you. Of course have a mixture between with oriel and the solvent. And to separate those two. You can use for example roche reef apparation. And the rotary if upper rates are the sole phones. Separated from the. And then you have your oil. And you can weigh the amount of oil that comes out from the starting products. If you also know. The mass of to starting product. Then you can calculate what the total fat content twice. Now here you have an example of that stocks let extraction how does that work so what you do for example here you have. So if leaks. And you want to know the fat content of those. Flakes. So what you do is use a merchant or those flakes. And the whole foods. And that is what happens when the sox live extraction. So you have the flake to flake contains. Oil. And you put in for example hexane. Now what happens is that the oil goes out of the fleet into the hexane. And then you take the flakes out. And you separate the fleets from the. Hexane that now contains the oil. And you have to fat free flakes. Now to the. Hexane with oil. Have to be separated again from each other and that is what happens in the road three of upper rates or. So dan the. Crude oil. Here is separated from the hexane. And then you can measure the amount of oil that comes out. All of the flakes in the beginning. Not a second. Analysis that i want to discuss. Is a fatty acid composition. And how does that work so you start would be extracted fat samples so you start with a. A pure oriel then what first needs to happen is to support the fight effect the acid so you cleef the. Fatty acids from the cholesterol. Than those free fatty acids. Need to be methylated. So it's reacts with methanol. And then the methylated asked for a fight with you as for a fight fatty acids are done. Applied on the g c on the gas chromatograph graph. And they are separated in the crust. Gas chromatograph. Here you see the process so here you have a triglyceride. It is supposed to fight so you get three. Free fresh. Fatty acids and glycerol. And then to free fatty acids react with methanol. And you get the. Methyl aster of fight. Fatty acids. Now just those smithville as for a fight fatty acids are done separate it's. On the gas chromatograph. And that is what you see here so. Each peak represents. A fatty acids. Now what you can see here is two things. First of all you have a retention time that is to time. When the fatty acid comes off. The g.c. and so the return sion time tells you what type of fatty acid it is. Here you can see it. At this time. Sixteen zero is coming off. And the later. Eighteen one is coming off and here you have a peak of. Eighteen to and probably to small peak. Here. And it's probably eighteen zero. So you separates the fatty acids and. They all have their own retired. Time. And the height of the peak or actually the area. Under to peak tell should the amounts of that fatty acids are to concentration of the fatty acids. Into food sample. Now i have a question off for you. You have an oil some pool and. Oil some pool contains two fraction it's a mixture of two fractions of triglycerides and those two fractions have a very different melting point. How would you determine the fatty acids composition of each fraction. And explain your process step by step guide. There are of course different solutions here depending on how you approach to this step by step. But. First of all of course you have to separate those two frets. And you could do that by yeah it's used for melting point for discussion a way to do that is what we call fractionation. So now you have to to separate it's fractions. And then. Each fraction first you need to suppose to fight a triglycerides and a fraction. Then you have to let the react. Fractions. React with. Methanol so you get the methylated. Fatty acids. And then you analyze those samples. Ritz. G.c. and. Afterwards to do a gas chromatograph tell shoe. The peaks tells you the amounts of each fatty acids in the. In both fractions. So to summarize in this knowledge clip. I've discussed. To difference. Lippert analysis techniques i've talked about how you can analyze. Total fat content in the food product. And i mean be discussed on the cell phone the extraction methods. And secondly i've talked about the analysis of fatty acids in a food product how you do that with gas chromatography.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip is about the processing of fats and then more specifically about the modification of fats. And this knowledge that i would like to discuss three types of. Mortifications and they will change the gamma coal and or physical correct restricts of the fats. So we should say we are going to discuss hydrogen eastern. Interest rif occasion. And fractionation. Now let's start with. Hydrogenation. In hydrogen nation. What happens is that unsaturated fatty acids in the trike less rights of an oil. Are such a reach it. So the double bonds. Become single bonds. This is done by means of. Applying hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst. And it is also called fat hardening. But here you see a picture of margarine. And this margarine is made by using a fetched a ball oil. Not a factual oriel. It is an oil so it's pretty liquid. And by hardening this oriel. It becomes more solid. And then you can apply it. Into a margarine. You can make. Partially hydrogenated fats than not all the double bonds i had are hydrogenated or completely hydrogenated fats. In which all the double bones. Are changed into single bones. The left look. To it is process in more detail. So what you see here is. Unsaturated fatty acids which is part of the triglyceride. And here to double bond is. Now changed later in a process into a single bond so how does this work first. It is a sword. To a catalyst. Very often nickel is used as a catalyst than. Hydrogen is conducted its. Fruity heats of the oil. And hydrogen it will act on the police where the nickel. Was bound to. The fact the asset. And then another hydrogen atom. Will be applied to the double bonds and then the nickel dissolves off the fatty acid. And then. The double bond. Is changed into a single bond. Now if you would do that to an oriel and you would look at the difference between. Before and after hydrogen nation. And the fatty acid composition. Then you will see that the fatty acid composition has really changed. And if you really look carefully to discraft what you see as that. After hydrogen h. and especially the amount of the sixteen three. Has lords. A lot and. The amount of c sixteen two. Has lowered a little bit. But the amount of c sixty one has increased. Now you could wonder why did this happen. And this is because very often. First those fatty acids with a lot of double bonds. Will be hundred natured first. And later. Fatty acids which. For example only one. Double bond. Will be hydrogenated. So see sixteen three first turns into a. Sixteen two and a c. sixteen to will first. Turn into a c. sixteen one. And then to see sixteen one will turn into sixteen zero so at first sixteen three and this to sixteen two. Are changed into c sixty one and that is why you see more c. sixteen one. After hydrogenation. Now. If you have hydrogen ation done normally. The double bond this changed. To a single bond. But sometimes what happens is that the nickel comes off too early. And if that happens then. Instead of two hydrogens. That are attached to the double bond. Now first one hydrogen was attached. But that high. Comes off. Again. And the double bond comes back. And if that happens then the double bond. Can be formed into a configuration. Or into a trance configuration. And that is when trans fatty acids are formed. This is undesirable. We don't want trance fatty acids in our food. Because they're supposed to have a negative health effect. Ok that was about hydrogenation. Numb going to talk about interest or if you cation not. Interest her vacation again is in the presence of a catalyst. What happens is that the position of a fatty acids. On the triglycerides is changed. Within the fatty acids. Or between. Within the triglycerides or between. Triglycerides. For example if you would take a pure triglyceride with. Only stare ins or a. Triglycerides would only olin's. Then and you would mixed. To two with interest certification done. You see that all kind of difference right list of rights can be formed. So the results of the interests are thick ation is nor change into the fatty acid composition. That's the same. But a change and two to try glycerin its composition. And because of that. Change into triglycerides composition. You will definitely have a change in the chrysalis ation behavior. And the melting behavior of this oil or fats. Not the next modification that can be applied. Is fractionation. In fractionation what you use is a difference a melting point. Within fractions within an oriel a good example is palm oil. The composition of palm oil. Has fractions that were all melt. Earlier. Other parts of the palm oil. And you can use that to differentiate between the two. So if you fraction need to palm oil you can get two different fractions you can get a fraction with a low melting point. And would a fraction with a high melting point. And you do this by cooling down. The. The palm oil. And then taking a wait. The fraction that has become salt it. And leave the liquid fraction. And then you have two different fractions. Now if you know what look at to. Melting behavior of the two fractions the old infection is taron fraction. Then you clearly see an effect on how it changes. When you heat heat up an oil the oil infraction. Than the solid fat content goes down. Much quicker for the old infection so it has a lower melting point. Than for to stare infection. So you can use it in different products. This terror infraction is a very useable in for example a margarine. Ok now i have a question for you not i. I have discussed three different modifications. A question about hundred you nation. What effect will hydrogen nation have on the following properties of fat. The melting point. And the sensitivity to oxidation. That if you look here at this picture than you see here at triglyceride would a lot of double bonds. So very unsaturated. And after. Hydrogen nation. You will have much less. Double bonds in this. Triglyceride. It means that this second. Triglyceride will much easier to make. Crystals. So it will have an increased melting points after hydrogenation. Also because you have much less double bonds. Oxidation will take place much eat less easy. There's also a reduced sensitivity to oxidation. After hydrogenation. So to summarize. In this knowledge clip. I've talked about a modification of facts. Talked about hydrogen nation how the hundred your nation. Changes and. Unsaturated fatty acids into a such heated fatty acid. But also how you can get trans fatty acids. Secondly i've talked about. Interest or if occasion. After interest or vacation you still have the same fatty acid composition. But. Because you have now have a different triglycerides composition. This might influence the chrysalis ation behavior. Off your fat. And then thirdly i've talked about fractionation. So really. Fractionating an oral into fractions and often it's a high melting and a low melting fraction.",

                "text": "And this knowledge clip. I'm going to talk about the processing of fats and specifics i'm going to talk about the isolation of fats and of the refining of fats. If we talk about isolation dander in general three ways of isolation of fats from the raw material. You can do either pressing. And this is often done on one fruits like palm fruits or on seats with a high fat content. Or you could use solvent extraction which is often done with taxing and. This is often done on seats with a lower oral content. And then the last. Isolation procedure could be. Isolation. By using heat. Which is often done by using warm water or by using steam. And this is often done for example to remove fat from fish or from meat. But after pressing. There is often a press kick in this is to the left over of the pressing. And it always still contains some fat. And then the press cake here's an example of. Cakes. The press cake is than. Furder. Isolated by use of. Solvent extraction. Not. Here you see. I want to show you an example of the isolation of cocoa butter from. Cocoa beans. Not a whole process starts with the parts that grow on trees. And then. The beans. Are extracted. Out of the cocoa pots. The beams are put on big heaps. And sometimes. Depends on the origin of the country where the produce. Make the chocolate. In this case they make the big heaps and they cover it with banana leaves. And then inside this heap. The cocoa beans start to for months. And the fermentation you did change. The cocoa beans. Did the white lady around the cocoa bean. Will be fermented off and the beans. Change into brownish beans. Now these beings are dry hts and then the dried beans. Go to for example to deny the lens and. There to beings or roast it. After roasting and taking off the shelves. The shell. That the surrounding beans than. What is left over to cocoa next. Are broken. And this is done by. Wheeling a round foot. Because big stone wheels. And what you get out of that is cocoa liquor. Not a coke a liquor. And the next step the coke liquor is pressed. And by pressing the cocoa butter. Leaks out of the coke will liquor and. After cooling it down again you get you get really hard cocoa butter and. The left over is. Again the cocoa cake. Not a cocoa butter out of the press is about. About. Let's say. Eighty to ninety percent of the fat. Will be extracted. Out of the cocoa liquor. And the rest of the fat. Is still present in a cocoa cake. And a cocoa cake is the same as cocoa powder. So cocoa powder still contains some cocoa butter. Now that was about isolation. The next i want to discuss is refining. Of the. Isolates its oil refining is first of all to ream you remove impurities. Out the crude oil or fat is converted into a more suitable. Product. And that is what we call a refined oil. Not a refining process consists of the following steps. And these steps could be applied in. Maybe a little bit of a different order of. Not all stops are applied on each. Oil. And in general first you have a pretreatment then after that. Removal of lecithin d. gumming. The acid if occasion or neutralisation bleaching and diodorus shannon. And i will go over. Each step. Very shortly. So here you first have for example a filtering step. Can be applied to remove small insoluble compound. Than the next step could be to dig gumming. And where you remove. Forceful that puts lecithin proteins carbohydrates. Then the next step could be the acid if acacia and what happens there is that. Free fatty acids. So these are. Assets. Are removed so that is why we call the dea asifa cation. After disk process you could do a bleaching step in a bleaching step you. Re your remove. Mainly colored compounds. So it could be glorified or corrupts annoyed that kids of color. I knew partly removed out during bleaching. And the next step could be. The authorization to steam desolation. And you remove the volatile compounds. And of corvallis tile compounds could be an old door so that is why we called it the authorization. And finally done you get the refined oil. Now you see an example of how a crude oil in this case it's or rapeseed. Canola oil and. The crude oil which you kind of see through and it's really dark in color. After refining. It has changed and two light colored. Oil which is very admirable. While this oil. Nobody would like to buy this to bake. It's food in there. Now. Let's see if you now can answer this question my question is why is. No bleaching step. Applied to all of oil. Now the answer is of course very clear if you look at all if oil it has a green color and that is also what consumers expect the art of oil. They expect all of. Oriel to be green. So if we would bleach the oil off oil. Then we would lose dees green colored compounds or to glorify. So to summarize. In this knowledge clip. I've talked about the processing effect so i've talked about the isolation of fats from raw materials and. About the refining affects. If we talk about isolation then we. Youth you should think of. Pressing solvent extraction and he's saying. And if we talk about refining you think you should think of the removal of faceted and gumming. The acid if acacia and bleaching and the authorization.",

                "text": "Welcome. I'm going to talk about a case control design. Especially about the major challenge in a case control study. The selection of cases. And controls. Here. This is to basically sign over a case from troll study. You have a defined. Population in india's population people who get the disease. The cases. And in the same time period. People do not get the disease. The controls. And you're interested in knowing in. Whether there's a certain. Exposure which is increasing the risk of the disease. So you're asking the cases. As well as to control so you're measuring. Whether they have been more or less exposed. In the past. Case control studies sometimes also call a case of reference or a case. Referent. A study. And when to use a study like this. Well. Especially if you have a rare disease. Disease which is not very frequently occurring. Or when is has a very long latency time so it's a good. As cancer it takes a very long time. To to be diagnosed to occur. And you can imagine if you have a very rare disease. Or a very long time. If you are having a cohort study you will need a huge coord study to be able to pick up. Enough cases. Or. You have to wait for a very long time for these cases to occur. Therefore we use a case control study. You can only. Of course look at once. Disease. At the same time because you're sampling your cases out of a population with that certain disease. To only one outcome. Which is different from a cold study. Where you can look at all different types of diseases. At the same. I'm. Here. The you have the opportunity to go into. Somewhat more death. On what you are measuring what exposure you're measuring because you have less people in your study. So maybe you don't need to give them a self administered questionnaires but you could do a face to face interview. Or you could easily measure. Take blood samples or urine samples even so you have to think that. That's one of the great advantages of a case control study. Other advantages. May be. But be careful. It could be a less burden to the participants. Because you're not following them. Up in time is. It's a one time thing. A one time interview one time. Questionnaire. That could be true. Also you could say it's. It's faster than a cold surgery. That may be true. But don't forget it might be difficult to recruit your cases and controls and. It may be cheaper. But it could also be. Still expensive. And this as said. Is there is a real challenge to case control study the selection. Selection of cases. Who are you going to select for your study. Who are going to be in your study. Is this. Every presented if sample of. All the cases that you have your population. And who are you going to include. Are you going to include only. Newly diagnosed. Cases. Eight cent cases. Which would be the best. You could also include prevalent cases so. All people have the disease. At a certain point of time. So not only newly diagnosed. Here you should be aware that the deceased's may influence what you're measuring as the. Exposure. If you. Taking blood samples for instance. Your disease may influence. The biomarker sure measuring your blood sample. So be careful with free for school sation. As you also see that in a cross-sectional study. With prevalent cases. Be also aware that you have the healthy cases. You have the people who are still able to participate. You have the survivors in your study. Which may not be reprieved sensitive for the total population. Even more challenging is selecting the proper control group. The control group should be reprinted safe. For the population the source population of the cases so where are the cases coming from. Also you should be really careful that you do not take a selection of the controls. Which may be related to the exposure. So you should take a sample of the total population which is really presented if as far as exposure goes for the total population and that's a real challenge. You could get. Controls from different sources. From the general population. From a form of from records trees from used to pursue policy records trees. You could get them by random digit dialing or using records trees from general petitioners postal courts etc etc. You could also use. Hospital controls. Which has the advantage. That is that you are interviewing or. Giving them questionnaires in the same population. So in the same story in the same environment. The cases and controls. Are interviewed in the same environment. In the hospital. Which may be an advantage. It's might be efficient to to recruit hospital controls. But be aware that the disease. East because they're also in also thought so they have a disease that this disease. Is not related to the exposure you're interested in. So think about whether you should use. People with car accidents. If the cases are those with liver disease. So in summary. I hope you fluent. A little bit about the basics. Of selection. Issues in a case control study.",

                "text": "Built in the low. Say. Welcome to cancer epidemiology. Today i'm going to discuss with you. The instance. Prevalence and mortality. Of cancer. First of all we have to ask ourselves question what is cancer and that's not an easy question what's an easy question was not an easy answer. Because cancer. Means that there are more than hundred different types of disease. They have. One thing in common and. That is that there is a cell profe. Which is unstoppable. You can say. Here you can see it goes from one cell. More cells more cell and. And. And finally you find a malignant tumor which is able to grow fruit. Blood for souls. Through. Lymph festivals and. Commit their societies to other organs. That's what they have in common and uncontrolled self grove. And how do city occur what it occurs due to various mutations in d.n.a. along the way. Genetic changes which can either be inherited or in the large percentage. They are a quiet. During life. And it's not only genetic changes we know noted there are also. Everything that exchanges. Not changes within d.n.a. but. Changes in the folding. Of the d.n.a. which also helps this malignant tumor to grow. Furthermore. Besides changes in d.n.a. there's also a clonal selection of mutants which makes the cells. If these grow at centers and grow faster than normal cells. So this is cancer and this whole process. May take thirty to forty years which me it's not easy to find. Out. What is actually. The reason why this is occurring. First we can call. We can look at the occurrence of cancer. In the world. And luckily there are very good. Databases. Now and one of the best databases is what we call the global ken cancer database. From the international agency for cancer research. In leo. And they gather information from cancer records trees. All over the world. In two thousand and twelve there were hundreds and eighty four countries delivering data to the database. And they have data on. Twenty eight types of cancer. And of course these cancer records streets are not all. Covering the whole population of a certain country. Small countries it's easier you have easier. Coverage for there's a good infrastructure. In europe and the u.s.. There's a huge. Coverage of the conspirators trees. In asia africa south america it's progress thing. But not the school. Yet soldiers may still be cases. Missed. In this database. What is now estimated and these are the data from two thousand and twelve. Is there are fourteen point one million new cases per year. So the incidence is forty point one million. In the world and. As you can see the major cancers contributing to that. Global cancer of burden are lung cancer breast cancer. Colorectal cancer prostate cancer. And stomach cancer. Those are the most frequently occurring cancers in the world. When we look at mortality. We see that. It's now eight point two million. Cancer related deaths. In two thousand and twelve. Globally. And luckily the mortel. Thirty of cancer at least in the developed world. Is decreasing. Because we have screening practices and. Because we have better treatments. And i sure can see the. Mortality is highest. For lung cancer. Stomach cancer. And liver cancer. And all cancers is contributing to a thirteen percent of all of this worldwide which is not as large yet as. The deaths contribute. Contributed by communicable diseases or. Nutrient deficiencies. But it's definitely on the rise. Here you can see a problem. The age standard varied rates. Of the incidents. And the mortality. Of different types of cancer and. Interestingly you see therefore for breast cancer prostate cancer coral rectal cancer. The incidence of the disease. Is far larger than the mortality of the disease. So it's treatable. For lung cancer. The instance. Unfortunately is quite similar to the mortality of the disease. Which means that a lot of people die from lung cancer and this of course. Has an impact on the prevalence of the disease. Here you see depicted the five years prevalence also based on the global can they debate in two thousand and twelve. There were thirty two point six million people. A life with cancer. In the end which was diagnosed in the previous five years. And here as you may expect. The incidence of the prevalence story of breast cancer corrector cancer and prostate cancer. Is the highest. So most people with cancer. Living with cancer in the world. Have breast cancer go rectal cancer or prostate cancer.",

                "text": "Welcome to this clip. Clip on measures of us wish asian or ratio measures. And we want to know these measures of association. Because we want to know what is the actual. Association between a certain exposure. And a disease. So we need to sort of estimate of the magnitude. We need to compare the risk of a certain disease. Among those who are exposed. First is the risk of the disease. Among those who are. Unexposed. So we estimate that magnitude in the. Association between the disease. And the exposure. And we can be rife these. As you change shins. By just calculating the ratios between the frequencies. And these frequencies. Measures that you are using to measure these or to calculations ratios. May differ between the different study designs. That you're looking at. So they can differ between a cross sectional study where your calculating. Preferences or a cohort study. Where you are measuring. Incidence rate or incidence proportions. Or a case control study. Where you actually do not have real real incidence but you have an estimate of that instance and here you are measuring an officer ratio. All these measures. All these as of show you can calculate. By just using these two by two. Table where you can calculate frequencies. For instance look at this table which is from a cross-sectional study where the investigators were interested in. The question whether exposure. Is associated. To headache. Frequency. And in this case it was a cross-sectional study. So they measured consumption and. Occurrence of headaches at the same time. We do not have an instance but we have a preference here. So you can calculate the prevalence. Among those who are exposed to the whole. And the prevalence of the disease. Of the headache. Among those who are. Unexposed to elko. And here. It was just a simple measure it's. Those who are expert. Disposed to call. Who have a headache to fight it by. The total population was exposed to all and. You have those who are exposed to go have no headache at divided by the total population who is not exposed to elko. And that's your prevalence. Ratio. It's just the ratio between the two. Measures in the next post and in the. Unexposed. Which is one point eight seven. In this case. In perspective studies. As i said you could calculate an instance. Depending on the time of followup that you have how long was your follow up time. And how large is your cohort study. You will either calculate. Person b. years. And here you can calculate. Incidence rates. And does an instant rate. Ratio. Or if you have a short follow up time. And you can calculate a number of patients of a persons. Because you can follow them up completely. You can calculate incidence proportion ratio. Now let's look at this example or. No first i have to tell you that. Whether you either. If you have a rape ratio or. A risk ratio. It's all what we call a relative risk. So a variance of risk can be both of these two ratios. Now let's look at how we calculate the relative risk. In this case. This is an example of an instance rate. Ratio relative risk. So here we have. The person years of observation. We were able to follow them up for a very long time but maybe not everyone and. It was a cohort which was changing all the time. We have the number of cases in the cohort so we can calculate an instant rate among those who are exposed to call. And incident rate among those who are. Unexposed. And the ratio is two point. Twelve. The relative risk. Is two point two f.. Now the last one is a case control study. And in a case control study you do not have the total incidence in your population. Because you're taking a sample. Out of the population. As your controls. So in this case we have an estimate of an incidence rate or incidence proportion. And here you can see that we have. The number of cases. And they were either exposed or unexposed and a number of controls. Exposed or. Unexposed. And here we co-create. Across racial. And of trace you. And i sure can see. This also ratio. Is two point one three. Now how do we interpret. Interpret these measures of association. Where it doesn't really matter whether it's a relative risk an ulcer ratio. Or prevalence ratio. They're all to put it in the same way. And thus. Relative risk. Of one or north ratio of one. Means that there's no association. In case of relative risk. The incidence. Among those who are exposed. Is similar. Or the same as the instance. Among those who are. Unexposed. Which means. There is no association between the exposure and the disease. A relative risk. Of one is. If the relative risk. Is larger than warm. It means that the risk of. Is higher among those who are exposed. Thus there is a positive associations between. The exposure and the disease. Thus this. Exposure is increasing the risk of the disease. And if you see a relative risk of. Which is smaller than one. It means the opposite so it means to the extent that the risk of the disease among those who are exposed. Is lower than the risk among those who are. Unexposed. This. It means that there's a negative as a she a she infers as she a she or you can call that a protective effect. Now just let's look at these examples. A relative risk of two. You can interpret as an increase in risk. Which is two fold. Relative risk. Of point five bins and you really have to be careful with how you interpret these data. A relative risk of point five means that there's a fifty percent decrease in risk for that certain exposure. I think. I'm not going to give you the answer but just think whether a relative risk could be lower than zero. Could be negative. Think about that. Ok. So for now. I hope you. Flu and. How to calculate. But also house in to put. Measures. Of association. Thank you.",

                "text": "In this clip. I will tell you something about quality. And for liberty aspects of when the mice controlled trials. First we start with confounding. When the mice can talk trial. Is a strong. Epidemy logical design. Because it prevents confounding. Founding is a major issue in observational studies. But because in a when a mice trial. Treatment. Is l.-o. catered to by means of chance. Confounding. Is not the major issue. What is. Confounding. Founding means that the option of the shochet should between an exposure and an outcome. Is not really due to the exposure. But to a third factor. That's related. Both to the exposure. And the outcome. But that third factor should not be part of to disease process so it should not be part of the exposure. Outcome. Pathway. Here is an example of confounding. That's for sure you want to study the effect of. Pathological gambling. On the outcome suicide. It is possible that people who feel depressed. More often start. Gambling. And it's also possible that pressure is a predictor of suicide. It's even quite likely. In this case. When you find an association between gambling. And suicide. It may not be due to gambling itself. But it could be caused by the fact that people are depressed. In this example. Depression is a confounder. And you must get rid of that confounding. Influence in your analysis. Or in the design of your study. It's also important that the pression is not part of the causal pathway. Let's assume that. Gambling. Losses depression and. That would cause. Suicide. In that case. You should not adjust for the confounding factor. Because it's part of the disease pathway. In the when the much control trial. Where you would. If it's not. It's an ethical but if you would. When most people to gambling or not gambling. And then study the effect of suicide. You don't have the problem of. Confounding because depressed people are equally distributed among the gamblers and the norm gamble us. In a trial. Here i show it again. Imagine this is your study population. The d's people. Have to confounder. When you when the mice these people. To getting a short an agent like. Medication or control tweet meant. Because of chance. The confounding factor. Is equally distributed among both coops. So for dissuasion. The randomized control trial. Gives more information about the call so. Relationship. Than an observational study. When i went to my study. Is a small study. You may have better luck with when a musician. Because of chance you could still have an equal balance between a co-founder in the treatment and a control group. That's assuring that. Gender is an important confound i think you can do the following. You first if i do study population in man and women. And then you do to when a musician. Within the two. Straighter. And in the end. Your data analysis. You pull both tweet and placebo groups again. This is called straight a fight. When a musician. They you help when you know a little bit. By. Assuring that an importer confounder at least is equally distributed across both coops. And other major for liberty. Issue in a trial. Is related to blinding. When you know that you're getting a certain treatments. And you may even believe in the health effect of the tweet meant. That could influence the outcome of the study. So blinding means that people are unaware of what treatment. Is given during the trial. That can be done for the participants so that the participant doesn't know what he or she gets. It can also be done both what participants. And the investigators. And then it's called a double blind study. Of course it's not always possible to blind people to watch treatment. For example in a weight loss study people notice when they are in the active intervention group. But when it's possible it's really recommended that you do blinding. And you may even do the data analysis. In a blind that way by getting blinded tweet minute cold. Your dataset. And deep blind. These coach. After you have done. The data analysis. Another major issue that you should be aware of in a trial is compliance. Compliance is the extent that people are here to treatment that's prescribed. To people do. What you say. And used to have money toward it. During a study. You can do that in or projective way. By measuring some biomarkers in your anal blart. People may keep a patient die away you can count. Pills. Or you may monitor complies through. Internet or other means. In a data analysis of a trial it's important that you. Applied the intention to tweet. Principle. What does it mean. Well it means that. Those who were in there when the mice to cope. For treatment. And control. Stay in that group during data analysis. Even when they did not comply to the treatment for example. So you include all went to my subjects in your data analysis. You assess the effect of treatment. Based on the when the musician. And not on the fact where the people actually at he had to tweet me or not. And that's important because when you eliminate data from your data set for hmong compliant. Or subjects. Last to follow up. This may yield. Biased we selves. Because people who don't adhere to the tweets ment's. Or who drop out. During the trial. May have responded differently. To treatment so you should keep them in your analysis. However when you include noncompliance of fifty one alice is the effect that your estimates for your treatment will be weaker than when people would have complied. So you get the somewhat weaker results. There are guidelines for doing. A clinical trial. And these guidelines include good clinical practice you can weave more documents about that. As stated here below. It's actually four. To walk two miles. And it just give support to call for doing the study in the wide way and that it's also say for the patients who are your study. It's also recommended to register your trial. Before you start to be quoting your subjects. Because if you don't register your trial. It may not be published in important papers like the lancet or jama. There is a guideline. Also for reporting. Off. When my control trials which is called. Concert statement. It's important that you. But he had to that statement where you want to publish the results of your trial and these can all be found on the internets. One part of the concert.

                "text": "This clip is about twenty all these are things there are two main types of controlled trial. On top you see the parallel trial. Which means that people maintain a certain tweak moment. So out. The entire trial periods. So they are when the mice to id the intervention. Call border control hope. And they stay in that school join the old. Study. Another type. Is to close over study. Their people receive. Both sweetmeats. So. In fact. People are their own. Control corp. For example they start with an active intervention. Called a and half way to study. They switch to the control. Sweetman to be. Whereas the other group that starts with b. switches to the active tweet went halfway to study. Here you see it. To peer we have cause over study. But you may even have. Earthly periods or. For period study. So people switch. Treatments. That's the main feature of a. Cause over study. For you to think about when you can post a feel if you want. What do you when the mice. In a course over study. So you don't win the mice to tweek mint itself because people get both sweet moments. And a control. Tweet. Once. So what do you win the mice in a quiz over study. Well effects you when the mice to tweet meant. Order. You do that because you want to get weight off. Time effects. So it may be important. That a time factors that could influence the effect of the treatments are when the mice. Across two groups. A course over study is also called the two periods study. Or a b. b. a study an example is given here. You cannot use a cause over study. For answering all. We should questions it can only be used when the. Exposure has no. Long lasting effects. So you don't want to exposure to have an effect. Also in the next pia we are twenty you have control tweaked mint. So you must be able to achieve an effect within the period that people are at here to get treatment. It can only be used for. Outcomes that are weaver shabelle. Because after the treatment people get another tweet meant or the control tweet meant. And then that. Outcome should occur. Occur. Again. Or should be reversed and. That must be done within a relatively short period of time. So which quite hard to do were course overstudy with hip fractures for example as the outcome. Because if people get a hip fracture in period. Eight. Then it's hard to study the incidence of hip fracture it in period. Be. Tweed. Months maybe separated by a washout periods. Sometimes it's important to get rid of to dry up for example during. Active tweet meant. Form the body. Before entering a new period. And that's called the washout. Periods. Another question for you to think about. Would close over twice will be a good idea to assess the effect affection nation on influenza imagine we'll have a study population of people. A charity and over. And we when the mice them. To fractionation. With an active agent. Followed by placebo fractionation. Or the other way round. The intervention periods. Are two month. Would this be a good idea. You may post a video to think about it. Well the answer of course is no. Once people are facts native with the active agents. It's no use to study the effect of fiction nation with a placebo. After that. Because they are getting. Immune an iced. So there is no two studying effect. Of a placebo. So faction nation has a long lasting effect. And cannot be studied in a way in a modest controlled trial. With a cause over the sign. Another type of archie t. is to community trial. That's often used in public health. So. Mainly focused on climate be these prevention. And the unit of when a musician are communities. For example. Towns. Schools but not single individuals. The intervention may be provided by general practitioners by community health services or by their hospitals. And it is suitable or designed for testing lifestyle interventions that cannot be l.ok.e. that. Single individuals. For example where you want to study the effect of healthy eating in a nursing home. Who have to when the mice the whole kitchen. Because they're poor fight all food. To the west of the nz or the nursing home. There's also the quasar experimental. Study. It's a twice. Without when the. Assignments. To treatments. So there's no control group involved. Why do we call this a trial. Well it's still the investigator who. Assigns. The exposure. And what he or she does. Is in fact just a poor. Post. Test comparison. So you. Test people before giving a certain treatments. For example or to work or. Behavioral intervention. And then after that intervention. You measure. These people again. And it's often used in a hospital or in a public health setting. Why do we do such toadies because they are less falut than deal when the most controlled trial. Because there's no when the mediation. While you do that's because you are interested of course in studying because in effect. You can manipulate the exposure. But the main reason for doing this is because you are not able to do. A stronger experimenting resign because it's unfeasible or it's an ethical way you noted to show it into obvious effect if you cannot say to people that they are not allowed to get it. So day you do you do for example. Pre post. Test comparison to twila the sign is a strong these are in. But it cannot be applied to. Always search questions. But twice. Is relatively expensive. And when you have a where do you see these outcomes. You have to do. The twice you over a very long duration in many people. And that's not feasible. It's cannot be used for wisc factors that cannot be modified for example in genetic factors or. Birth weight. It may be an ethical to do or when a much controlled trial. For example in smoking or alcohol use. You can sink of other factors. It's also a not always possible to do when the mushed while in the white time window of exposure. For example if. Calcium intake would be important. Only in childhood. It's hard to do. A trois you all in all the people. Because then you don't find. The effect that you're really interested in. And sometimes to time when there cannot be children. Because it's an ethical. To put young children in a trial for example. You cannot study to food range of exposure in in an observational study you have. Doses. From fairly low intakes to high intakes in a certain population but. In a trial you can only study. For example. Two or three doses of the dietary intake. So now you should be able to know the difference between a parallel in a cause over these aren't you should know what's a community trial. What's a quasar experimental trial. And what are the limitations of when the mice controlled trial.",

                "text": "This clip. Is about. When the wife to controlled trials. Also called. The r.c.t.. I should teach part time. Of experimental study designs. Used in a pygmy on the cheek. There are also trials called normal when the mice trials. Which are also called quasar in experimental studies. But these will be discussed later. When the much control trial. Is also called the experimental study. The clinical trial. Or simply the intervention study. It has support spect if these are and so it goes forward in time. And you want to assist a fixie. Of an intervention or type of treatments. There's always some control to it went in fault. And it gives more proof of causality. Then. Just an observational study. This is the schematic. Overview of a parallel when the mice control twyla. To start with a certain population their choice interested in. These are assigned to a certain. Exposure or to the control corp you followed them in time. And to check whether they have outcome. Soul like a disease or certain health condition. Or not the main feature. Of an r.t. t.. Is that the investigator when the milly. Assigns the exposure. So that infest the gaita decides who will be exposed. And who will not be exposed. And that is done by means of. When a musician. So to say the investigator just tosses a calling and. Checks. Who will get the exposure and who will be in the control group. The exposure can be. All types of things. You can study the effect of a dietary pattern. Some lifestyle. Intervention like smoking says a. In some dietary supplements or. Types of diet. Medication a change in behavior. Or maybe a psycho social care or medical care. The outcome of a trial can be continuous. Or they got a mess. When it's continuous. You follow the level of the outcome. In time. I give an example here. About changes in blood pressure. During certain treatments. Addai gothamist outcome. Also called zero or one outcome or no yes. Or dummy or binary outcome is just an occurrence in time. Of a certain disease or condition. Like stopping with poking or. Incidence of a certain disease or hip fracture. And in this example. It's getting the flu or. Not getting the flu. After receiving. Effects nation. Decontrol twenty thousand can be just a regular treatment that's commonly used in medical practice for example. It can be also putting people on the waiting list. And giving no intervention at all. What can be a placebo. The treatment effect that we talk about. In a way and much control trial is not just a change occurring in the intervention group. But it's to change any intervention group. Minus to change in a control group and it's important to subtract the effect in a controlled hope to have to to effect. Related to tweet. Meant in the example given there hugh can see it's the difference in change. Between placebo and. Active intervention. Why is that important. Well we all know that just being part of a treatment. Means that it does something with your health. When you take part in a when and my control twi all. People are taking care of you and. That may be. Make you feel better. Even though there's no active tweet mint. Involved. And that's called the placebo effect. And the placebo effect can be quite powerful. Especially when you have psychological. Outcome. Parameters. But also it can be. Affecting your physical health. Where you feel better because you are taking part in some kind of. Trial. When mediation is important in a when my control tyo it's just allocating people to a treatment. By means of chance. So you can toss a coin. You can just saw with dice. Or you can use their when the number generator on the computer. To decide which people we see of the intervention and who is in the control group. And that's important because then you balance. All subjects. There were three stacks. Acosta to a tweet meant cope's. At the start of the study. Here you can see an example of a study where they assigned people. To a certain weight lost weight went. Or to placebo. And here you can see the correct which takes off this study population at baseline. So number of men and women. Age. Body weight height. Body mass index. And waist circumference and. Because of when the musician to control was similar to the intervention corp so. It's about the same percentage of men. It's about the same age involves corp's and these factors could influence the outcome of the study. But because they are well balanced. Accost two groups. You can be sure that the effect that you measure in the trial. Is only due to the treatment that you have given. So now you know. The trial concept. You know why it's important to have a control group. And you now know about the principle. Of when a mediation.",

                "text": "Welcome students as part of my lecture on infectious diseases epidemiology. I now want to introduce you on the topic. If you ation of strategies to. To try to eradicate polio globally. You know is a virus which is highly infectious. Occurring mainly in. Children under five years of age. Although in a large proportion one hundred percent of the children of patients. Polio is asymptomatic. And fortunately in the group who does. Have symptoms. There's a high chance to develop paralysis paralysis of. Legs and arms and causing severe handicapped children. There is no cure for podio but you can prevent podio by fixing nation. Which is very effective ninety to ninety percent. Is prevented by having this fix nation. Because all your in the last decades has really reduced in a lot of countries and continents and. Even a limb. Has been eliminated in some continents for example and you are because no polio anymore and also not a continent says no polio anymore. It is the aim overage and from the world health organization. To work towards podio a ready kate that will sort of. Eradication me says says ciro prevalence of an infectious disease anymore so zero prevalence is polio that is the aim for. So currently to independent board a monitoring board. Who is working for its global polio eradication initiative. And the target currently is that by two thousand and eighteen. We have a free willed. Unfortunately. It is very hard difficult to reach. Because. In the last years in which i also presented these data. There was already i had sly stats by two thousand and thirteen. It was the aim to have a polio free world but so. So far to this global polio. No initiative hasn't been able to tackle polio and. So to target the year of the target has been for water too late on. Here you see their kind of. Working plan and his schedule and. You see it for example already in the end of two thousand and fourteen. And it's same for to have the last. W b fiesole the case of wild polio virus. Globally and then there's also other steps which still have to be taken. But probably i will show you in the next light it's very difficult already. To reach this first milestone of the last. Polio case by the end of two thousand and fourteen. Different strategies or combination of different strategies for each. Is introduced. Globally. And especially in the polio affected area asked to eradicate polio. Main aspects of early cation is a high fixed nation coverage rate. Rates which are aimed for by giving taking care to infants have been high in new zation coverage of polio vaccine. And taking care of children a bovine years but. Under five. If each new vaccination raw and round are fixated again. Against polio. And in addition to to fix the nation aspect it's important to have an adequate surveillance system in place because if you have a good surveillance system in which you. Detect any case of polio in a very fast manner you can actually try to prevent distribution of new polio cases and therefore. Try to prevent spread and reach more to elimination already cation. So as to face off. Is an important aspect of the eradication. I will give you an explanation nation on how to how does civilians of polio is. Implemented it is in one way implemented through a human system in new york the way it's implemented. Frewen and environmental survey in system so first a human. Surveillance system a human. It means that countries who are all countries but especially also the countries who are affected. They have a f.p. it's called it was the clinical picture which i explained. In the beginning the acute edge of paralysis so to severe paralysis of children. Actually you don't look really for polio case but you look for cases. That's also the case to finish and children under fifty years of age. With this paralysis or any person. If this type of illness. So if you see a young child with such an illness. It's a high suspicion for podio and immediately. The diagnostic. Change should be started. So you have to check stools it's an. enteral fires so you're. It's in stool samples the virus can be detected. You have to take care it added. Transported to the. Adequate aboard tori's and you have to first. Try to diagnose a polio virus and if there is a virus you have to. Geno type it because you want to understand a region of the strain. So this is the human aspect. Tracing of new cases and doing the board torii diagnosis. But in addition it's also possible in countries where you have adequate sewerage system. To do is to fail is in the sewage system because the board. Tests for polio are so sensitive that any. Polio virus which has them can be detected very early and sometimes it can be detected before a human case exists so when in countries. At the b.s. that in a sewage system polio virus is active. Then it will also days countries bill and sure did. They have a very good human surveillance system in order to detect any case of polio very early. So despite this kind of every case in initiatives it's. I want to show you in this mess. That it's still difficult. To reach to save education. To first met on the left hand side is the situation of polio in two thousand and twelve. We have the yellow countries being countries affected and the red dots. Being cases. So you can see from this is two thousand and twelve on the right. Of foresight is two thousand and thirteen. You can see already in these two years there was an increase in the number of countries affected and an increasing number of cases. So despite the goal for eradication it's even increasing. And here in the two thousand and fourteen. Which is actually only half year two thousand and fourteen show from january to july. You see that still. Countries are affected and. Although this is only a map. If you can not adequately see the number of cases. In a more specific. Relation of cases. You see that the number of cases in two thousand and thirteen fourteen will probably already reach also the number of two thousand and fourteen. So the aim to have no cases at the end of two thousand and fourteen is actually hardly possible. Unfortunately. So to summarize the example of polio eradication. You can see that surveillance. For an infectious disease to be eradicated is very important to have a very good to face system. In order to monitor any new case. You have to have adequate. Case different nation again and. You have to know or by implementing this surveillance system. You know at least which countries aren't affected by the number of cases are. So you know where to focus your control measures on and. Disk ifs at a court so disobey in system will therefore give every. Adequate information for. Eradication cumbrians in specific countries eradication of polio.",

                "text": "Welcome students as part of my infectious disease epidemiology. Lecture i want to explain you about hiv fagan's. Surveillance of an infectious disease. It's necessary to first start way of defining your glow. Your health problem and in this case. I took the example of the prevalence of hiv globally and. The example that. It's necessary to evaluate better preventive measures taken to reduce effect if so does this kind of the health problem to start up a surveillance system on a hiv. So in a surveillance system is necessary to make a case if a nation in this example is just any age i feel aboard torie confirmed cases in i feel case. The source of data can then be from different sources i get from bob oratory speeches maybe the maze easiest because the case if an issue his laboratory. Originated from hospital deaths that they six zero notification systems. Then you have to come up with. Manner of data collection. That could be passive so. For example through and aboard torie out a metric system. Or ect if you could got to start. Actively with for example population studies. To collect your data on a trophy. Preference indisposition. Population. Of through a sentinel system. Off the net is done with h f e did for example you only screen risk groups or specific sentinel groups in a population of pregnant women or. Groups sexually at risk and. It's important to note folks pain in the next slice that the data you collect in this survey and system are used for health promotion and prevention of hiv in their risk groups. So by setting up an hiv surveillance system. You. Globally you can collect a lot of data and present these data. Which gives you more insight into the magnitude and the distribution of the problem. In this world. Can clearly see that hiv is almost occurring. Everywhere. It's also good to know always that's on a survey is met before evidence dated it may be white countries or grey in this case. Won't present shero. Hiv prevalence but often the situation is this. No data available so it's a non-issue. Not known what the prevalence is in such countries where you can see clearly is that the south in parts of africa is most affected. If hiv. Is also other ways which you can look at. So if a is date out for hiv for example. On those two graphs on the left hand side you can clearly see. This is the number of new infections. Globally. So in a way that is nice because you can see from the beginning to of two thousand and one that there is a real decrease in number of new cases so that's already trying to find a way sion that the number of infections is reducing. But on the other hand and which is logical because we have a lot of hiv cases and you can live for a long time with the people living with hiv. Maybe even increasing a little bit. But not decreasing yet it's not yet possible because people do live with hiv on the right hand side. Do you see the number of deaths due to age said a clinical syndrome. Of hiv. Which is on the decrease again since a few years. If you look at correct risk takes all of the. Affected people pure lation you see a world wide level that may be of the proportion of women affected this a bit higher. Fifty two percent as compared to the man who are affected and african countries you see that is that women are even more affected we have seven fifty seven percent of the patients being a woman being a woman sorry. And the reason for. Higher proportion of women affected is that it's physiological on its own mentally. They are more affected more vulnerable more susceptible to acquired asia v. infection and further as more social factors that they are for example. Have less economic opportunities are therefore more fuel in the road to rape and. Situations that they have sex or have to have sex for commercial reasons both are men older men. And this graph i present you in another way. Survey is information and because it's also very important to know which. Mode of french mission most occurring in that case because the different modes of transmission are for example hit two of sexual six or six. For meal to meal. Commercial sex or drinking action. I don't we sans your data for example. Mother to child transmission etc but this is for the adult population where did they get their. Hiv infection from. And if you look at different country says in this night you see that for the different countries. The group at risk for a very different income. It's for example mainly heterosexual sex with a partner. Although in russia and indonesia. Action is the highest group. Having hiv. And it's also we have such data as possible to compare different years within one country so he has this is a mistake from. Eighty nine to ninety eight. So you see that in kenya in this. About ten years time. The proportion of people getting hiv from sex for greed used a bit or substantially is not so big maybe. But at least there was a reduction in this year's sort of is probably an effect of. Any health promotion intervention team. And income boyar for example you see tits. The proportion of people also due to sex work we do substantially. But the contras that was a very huge increase in sexual sex. And this is trying to prevent. For example in a specific search may be sometimes very difficult in countries because when you focus your health information coming and the specifics of groups. You might spend less time on health. Prevention and. Promotion and not assert groups. And then sometimes the result is that you're trying to hit a moving prevention target. Which i will explain in this site. So this is an example from. Silence. And you can hear see data from one hundred eighty eight to two thousand and five. So in the beginning in ninety eight a larger proportion of h.l.v. person's voice joe to. Injecting drug users. So you see that already in about two years time disproportion decreased very much. Due to intervention. On this topic. But by decrease of the drug in yankton users to worship huge increase in demand having sex with a sex worker. So you can see deaths. Over the years. Then the darker. The black books. Increased very much it is the. Women having sex we have there has been so apparently within mariages then. The sex also increased very march and later on you see the drug and yanking increasing again. So it's these surveillance data are very useful for evaluating your intervention. But you can also see that it's sometimes difficult. Where to focus your interventions on. So to summarise on his age of the civilians. In this example you saw different. Important aspects of civilians. You can provide states eye on this case on a global prevalence in different ways the prevalence incidence the number of deaths so you have a picture of the global situation. At money towards speech risk groups. Are affected in which years and which countries. You can get information. And what is most important you can evaluate whether your interventions have any impact.",

In this graph you see the number of cases. During the last decade from ninety a seventy six. And these are the number of wilt wired's cases and you can see immediately already doubts it is also a lot of years to light grey shaded. We have found any cases of a bone or so because this is part of an outbreak investigation lector it's important to understand you that you always first start. If confirmation of an outbreak. And confirmation of an outbreak is that you are sure that a number of cases is more than what you usually would expect. And since a bola is usually. Non-existent so it's a zero level. That means that actually. Each case already. If it would be only one case or two cases. Then we already talk about an outbreak so also to very small or in this craft. Radha small outbreaks. Which still is maybe about twenty cases for example in ninety four. I called an outbreak and it's clear from this graph that. The two thousand and fourteen outbreak is fairly huge as compared to the other years. But you can also see from this graph that. A bowl of viruses very has a very high mortality rate because the dark. Area in the bars. Are the number of deaths so from the number of cases you see that the proportion of people dying is very high. A bowler presents as a viral hemorrhagic fever. It's a viral. Infectious disease. And it is caused by non human primates who. For example monkeys gorillas and chimpanzees who can spread their infection to humans. Munns humans are infected with a ball of fire as a human to human transmission can take place and other humans can be infected as bill frist mission takes place through contact with the flu. It's not by spreading of holes. And as explained. Case fatality rate is very high. In this picture you can see how the transmission cycle of a virus exists in various. Ecological groups. Here you see the bets and in the bets. This where one suspect it's suspected that there is a bowl of virus is living milty ple gating. And from the bits it's possible that. There's a transmission from bats to for example the non human primates or dear. So it is also a transmission cycle of bits. With other animals. It's also possible that the bits. Transmits to humans. Direct the or from this cycle to humans and as i explained that is in humans it's also. There is a human to human transmission cycle. In outbreak investigation it's important to have in a specific case this definition for each case. And this case a case to finish and i just present you because it's. To show you as an example it's a very complicated case to finish and. So you don't have to know it by heart but it's good to understand. In this case. Case if they can actually almost ok fissioned case definitions is always a combination of clinical profile way of laboratory information. So this part is about a clinical profile of a patient. Which you can see it has to fulfill a patient i reader. Number one. So is history cute fifi or which signs of bleeding or. Acute fever or bit of leads to free following symptoms plus or so it's always a very complicated story but it is necessary because if you have an outbreak. It's always different hospitals and. Maybe different regions different countries involved. All medical doctors public health authorities. Have to count. The same cases in order to know how large the outbreak is. And often his clinical profile is combined with. Laboratory confirmation so it's important that it was also in this outbreak to situation. The case. That you have to have adequate laboratories who have adequate. Test to detect. The specific microorganisms in this case a bowl of virus. So by having this case to finish an and by also using that. It's possible to come up with statistical information i mean logical information on the outbreak. And. For example you could have i presented earlier. A graph but you can also presented in a mess such as this. Here you can read it. Free countries are currently involved. So you have a leona and i bury our dead pictured here. Although at the end also nigeria has started now we have one case. So this is information from beginning of august two thousand and fourteen. And then in the dark red areas you see the high number order areas affected if cases. And the numbers of cases are on the right hand side so. About more than four hundred fifty liberia. More than one hundred sherry sherry leona. More than five hundred cases and still joe nigeria. Just one case. So this is possible to make such a mess. Because all countries. Use the same cave. Case definitions to count to same type of cases. In an outbreak it's necessary to take control measures of a bowl of fires is fairly difficult because fixie nation of humans. Is so far not in place and not. Existence. Vaccination of animals as well is not existence. So you have to prevent contact of the source said. For example to domestic animal. Animal or to wildlife animal. We have the humans. So it's maybe possible. That woods could be a control measure to isolate or to take care of the domestic animals are not in. Acted by wildlife any most. You have to prevent the risk of ebola. Infection in people by. Maybe preventing them from having contact with wildlife animals who could possibly harbor a bowl of virus. And for sure once you are in a patient's situation. You have to control the fact that you get an infection in the health care setting. So. Health care workers should we are protective clothing and shoot isolate. Patients in. Outbreaks it's also important to communicate communicate with people at risk and at a community. Communities in these countries are at risk of getting a bowl ad to suit the moment it's wider as also health promotion campaigns about. Misinformation about the cause and the consequences of a boa and especially currently and this outbreak it's important because it's a moment to villages the communities are afraid and they kind of. Have the feeling that the health care workers who treat. In out of villages would treat a bowler. If i was patients. Might introduce a ball of fire so for this. So it's a moment. There's a kind of unrest in communities and it should maybe be solved with adequate communication. So to summarise on a mole or a boat outbreak of two thousand and fourteen. It's a good example of how you. Steps are taken the outbreak investigation. To be sure that it is an outbreak. If we spec'd to have number of cases. And you have to compare it with previous year. You have to come up with an adequate. Case definition in order to create to count all your cases in the same manner. After counting you have to present your data. In graphs or maps or whatever. To have an overview of the making to it of the outbreak in fire it is possible you have to take adequate control measures and you have to communicate. Your information or your information results from the studies or your health information. To the public in order for them to adjust or two or tier two to control measures which are at full created.",

                "text": "Welcome a student's in spite of my infectious disease epidemiology lecture. I want to explain you about an important topic of. Infectious disease epidemiology and at this outbreak investigation is important and it's also often a very interesting. Type of investigation. So what does. Outbreak investigation of first of all actually what is an outbreak. An outbreak is actually the same as an epidemic or cluster and. At a diff an issue in is that it isn't. The number of cases. In a specific. Community or a space and a specific period of time in a specific group of people. Is frequency clearly in excess of a normal expectancy sort it's really what is written here. And also important for you to remember that it doesn't matter whether you talk about an epidemic. Outbreak or close to it all has the same definition so more cases. Then expect that that is in brief what you have to remember. And then in a specific region population etc and. Outbreak investigation for sure is the investigation of such an occurrence of an outbreak. And i'll break. Very complicated. You do have small outbreaks maybe just a diary real. Outbreak in child care center. But you're going holes have large outbreaks. For example a source. Containing the journal and of course in cases in a legionella legionnaires disease in a region or used outbreaks such as the mexican influenza. So you always for in order to to control the outbreak you need a coordination and control center. This is often a responsibility of a public health service ita regional or national public health service. And it is so complicated because in an outbreak you have to deal with the epidemiology part of the outbreak. Sold a number of the counting of cases to reduce doing of. Case is the description of their. Correct wrists takes. Clinicians are in full. Because those out of bonn identifying to patients treating the patients did abort tories and fulfil. They are the ones who provides the tests for it to confirmed the diagnosis of the outbreak and sometimes when. Food or animals. Are part of the outbreak or maybe a source of the outbreak. The food safety authorities are also involved. So. Combined with the media and other authorities states is a complex system that you have to coordinate. And because it's so complex it's important to follow the steps of an outbreak investigation which i explained to you here. First we have to confirm where there is an outbreak and you have to confirm its diagnosis confirmation of. Outbreak is that you have to be sure that what explains in the beginning that the number of cases in excess. As compared to a normal so you have to check with. Registries from other years or other seasons to know what are tweeting excess of cases. You have to confirm your laboratory diagnosis so you have to be sure that you're really talking about. For example a me says outbreak so you have to be sure to tell the board to stop positive for it if you know. If you have done this first step you know read out to raise an outbreak and you have to form an outbreak control team. Because if it is then your next step will be to identify the cases so you have to reach i explained in this survey and ideas value have to define your cases so. Everyone all medical doctors etc epidemiology just have to know which case should be included in accounting which cases are part of the outbreak. If you identified a case you obtain. Further information. For example. On gender on age. Okupe asian or whatever depending on what type of. Outbreak it is fiction nation status is sometimes also needed. You have to describe data i have because if you're an epidemiology is your responsible. For making curves. Very make you see how many persons. Are included in the outbreak how was the. Is it an increase or decrease of the outbreak. You develop an hypothesis. And depending sometimes you really know are ready if it's a nice outbreak you. You understand the mechanism of measles to mission. But sometimes there's an outbreak which. You don't know to really yet or you don't know what a source is so don't you have to do for the studies. So sometimes further analytical or additional studies. If you have done all the steps or maybe in the meanwhile already you always have to communicate. Your results and actually not only your results but also your control measures which are implemented sort this is communication to either political political parties or. Authorities of the municipality or of the country and for sure also to the public because the public also needs to be informed about your knowledge of a public health south or d. on the outbreak and also the implementation of control. Control measures. Then i want to explain you. What i told in the beginning that this was a kind of sense of urgency in. Outbreak detection and response. Because if you don't act. Swift. You may be very late. To implement your control measures. So just an example of any. First case of any. Outbreak starting on day one. If you are. This is an example of a kind of delayed reaction so if you are late in new year. Detecting the outbreak it may take maybe more than ten days before you. Detect the outbreak. If you have a don't have the laborde tests in place or you don't have to adequate laboratories that make. May make may be may take maybe twenty two days to have your lab confirmation. And then you were sponsors very late. If your response team is also late. You just have a little bit of opportunity for control. So it's important that you. Change this system and that. After a first case that you have a swift. Reaction of detecting. That there is an outbreak of cases that you have a laboratory confirmation in a few days and that your response team. Your outbreak control team is ready for example a day thirteen. And then if you are fos this and this slights. You have a lot of opportunities for control and you may reduce in a lot of number of cases. Just to give an example of the q. fever outbreak in the netherlands an example on the step of confirming the outbreak sort of number of cases in corn for confirming the microorganism was causing infectious disease. In may two thousand and seven there was a general practitioner. In a village in the netherlands who felt i think i see. Observe an increase of pneumonia cases. So kind of worried him. So after a few weeks he consulted some microbiologists. I do have an increase of cases and i can treat him. Adequately what is the cause of this cluster. Microbiologists. Did his tests and his first. Advice for us i think it's a michael plus cluster so you should treat. Accordingly. So deep be treated but still it didn't work out. Adequately. Meanwhile newspapers. Showed that it was a kind of mystery mysterious. Epidemic in adults fail h.. And to a democrat to new which. And then end of july again. The g.p. asked a microbiologist police. Doing new tests again. And actually damn by july only discovered it was a q. fever i'll break. And it wasn't a micro plasma. Break. So it took about two months. To discover which. Outbreak was own growing which was actually a quite delayed reaction. To course of this was that q if we've ever. Was hardly seen in n l and so q. fever was not in the regular board tory panel of the microbiologist. So it's also if you don't know reach what you're looking for it. Sometimes you just don't have to test in place. Just an example then of how to present how to describe your day to as one of the steps of an outbreak investigation. This is the epi curve over the. Dutch few feet for our a from two thousand and seven to two thousand and eleven. And you can hear us. See here that. This is the. I are inside a very small outbreak of two thousand and seven the case is. This is the period which i explained to you about the. Consultation of the g.p. microbiologists. Two thousand and eight towards more cases even two thousand and nine a lot of cases. More than two thousand and. You can see does its head was a had a seasonal aspect because q. fever is related to. Goats and sheep having. I think you fever and spreading a vendor outside in the meadows and. Contaminating or at transmitting. To person so that's why it's a seasonal aspect it's kind of. Spring summer. Infectious disease it wasn't in that lens. But for sure. An outbreak investigation control measures have to be taken a spill. So what was done. Was that after the peak of two thousand and eight. Because the government discovered or we had a. Outbreak into seven. Also in age we have to do something. So q fever became a notifiable. Infectious disease. For veterinarians if they discovered. Huell fever and sheep and goats that had to be notified when authorities. And hygienic measures were installed in these farms. It didn't really work in the end of two thousand and nine so fix the nation of dairy goats and sheep. Those implemented but still this fact he nation. After that still human cases existed so actually by late two thousand and ten it was decided to call all q five a positive. Sheep and goats and you can see that it was really the elimination of the source because afterwards to cases. Reduced very much. So to summarize on this outbreak investigation. Clip. Important to understand that it's always an occurrence of cases in excess of normal. That outbreak less than epidemic are the same. Different have the same definitions. Investigation is a complex process. You need to have an adequate coordination from a public health structure. Use. Should use this steps as i explained to you because at least then your work. Systematically. Urgency is required so also in your system you are working this. And you always have to communicate your results to parties involved such as public open dictations.",

                "text": "Welcome a student's. And this knowledge. Played by i want to explain you about an important aspect of infectious disease epidemiology which is. Civilians and. Civilians is its own going and systematic collection of data analysis of dates on this mission. Of days only fixes diseases. In order to money towards health problems for prevention and control. So these aspects are very important. You don't only collect data just to know something about a disease but you always collect them in public health. Context for prevention or. Control and. The next lies i will give you examples on how to collect how to analyze how to do some innate data. Because surveillance is not very complex but at least. You need a structured tool to work according to it's important that you followed these different steps or aspects of surveillance in implementing a surveillance system and. Collecting your data. So first of all logically you have to have a health problem because if you don't have a health problem you can start a new survey is system. And it could be for example the prevalence of flu. Mexican food prevalence of hiv. If you have this health problem. Of which you know that you have to collect data off. You have to come up with a case to finish it because you're not the only person who is collecting data that's also hopefully for your study or yours if a system is also out of institutes out of country said cetera. Who collect the same data. So you have to set up one case to finish and. On what is the case what is a patient which. Cases are we going to include in a system so if you have one common case to finish and everybody will collect the same. Cases and. Often this case definition consists of a kind of clinical. Profile of a case fifth specific information a laboratory confirmation. Then you have to define from each. Source of data you collect. Your information. It could be for example only be laboratory sort if you define old. Hiv positive tests. Are in my survey in system on a show fee. Or you have to or you can use. Hospital data. For example hospital discharge data all persons discharged with measles. As a measles case are in myself a system. Deficit this is going to use notification. Data. You can collect them in different ways specif so that's a kind of automatic system. Or you can start an active study to collect and for yourself a is system or in a sentinel way that's more kind of fifty different subsets of different. For example g.p. practices or. All spittles who participate in your survey and system. For sure you have to underlies them and to use them for action what i told you in the previous light. I want to give you an example on the influenza. And. First i want to start. To present you how can you collect data for surveys of influenza. And especially i took influenza because it gives a lot of opportunities to collect data. For example you can do it through search engines so nowadays. If your google search engines it appears that when. Persons. Enter. Flu or when they feel ill at home they might enter flu or influenza. To search for information and. Studies have shown that this information from the search engines is very valid gives very valid information on the occurrence of prevalence of influenza in a country or continent or whatever. You can use the general public. To to also to collect data on influenza. For example and melons we have to go to sleep mating a large flu measurement. In which a volunteer a fallen. Tierce. On a weekly basis enter on an online system what a day. Have fever headache. Missile pain etc. So in that way you have a weekly system. Of kind of flu occurrence. Based on. Perceptions of the public. Which is also peace to be a valid measurement. You can use. G.p. says i told you so they have a subset of you peace who collects information on patients with influenza like illness. You can only use it aboard torie specimens from. Influenza like illness patients so you find it all aboard tory tests positive for influenza. A b. or whatever. Dose are included a year influenza system in your. Sorry civilian system. Then through men day three notification for example. That's a system that these are not medical doctors or laboratories are obliged to notify the government over. About infectious disease for each day discomfort. And finally disc and. Actually this is not really a system but it can indeed all the systems can lead to a national and you are peon. Data collection systems. Again a more specific sample of. Flu civilians was the mexican flu in two thousand and nine. You may remember the health problem h was there a dent in mexico. Two thousand and nine. Clusters of influenza like illness and monia existence. Then later on in the usa. And at the children were. Appeared positive for influenza a which was from a swine flu or region so that gave an w.a.g.a.. w.-o.. So he world health organisation. Alert and in canada. Then also cases were detected with the same mexican flu. Based on the swine flu. So that was also an alert. And then there was a. Alert for the world health organization. That was a pandemic phase three. So there was a health problem at that moment so it was important to implement a surveillance system. To count and to know how many cases of influenza have were due to mexican food in these countries but also for example in you were not accounting ends. So it was important then to set up a case if a nation had the voice. Symptoms of influenza like illness. And a laboratory confirmation of this h one n one sort of a novel type of influenza virus. It was defined. Aboard tories and medical doctors had. Part of sources were the ones collecting the data for its civilian system and. Methods of collecting data was done through notification so the board tori's and medical doctors were obliged by law. To notify to have. Authorities so. Mostly the region or national public health authorities. To notify them of any case. Of h one n one. And by implementing such a civilian system it was possible to collect dates and also it's important to describe the status so you see an example of description of influenza cases collected by civilian system. The number of cases and. The date of report. This axis. And you can see the during to april till may in a few weeks time. A lot of cases are good all over the world and it was. Information for all countries and continents fella's information important information but also for the bill's health organisation. To come up with if their different phases of the pandemic and also the different alerts. But i told you you should actually use your survey has data for action. So for influenza. To action for you influenza is actually. You have to you want to reduce the peak number of cases so if you would not intervene in influenza you would have a very high. The green. High peak. Of influenza cases. And the problem if there's a high peak is if it's a very severe influenza which we initially suspected with mexican flu. Then you need a lot of. Hospital beds you need a lot of. Fancy lation equipment to assist patients infantilization maybe. I see your business. And then the health care system won't be able to cope if this number of cases. So instead of having such a peak of cases. You want to be if intervention. And intervention or explain later you want to reduce the peak. But most likely you will have about the same number of cases. But at least your health care system is able then to cope with these number of cases. So how can you prevent and control. Yeah in the beginning as explains in the previous knowledge hip. Patients were isolated. To prevent further distribution. You know for sure for influenza as always had been coughing hygiene so also preventing distribution. And vaccination is very important but as you know. Fix a nation in a new. New strain of influenza is not already. Immediately on the counter so it takes a few months before fractionation is there so that is a kind of delayed intervention but. May still go in feed bute to a delay in the number of cases doing influenza. So to summarize on this knowledge clip of surveillance you starts a phase when you do have a health problem. It's also possible for non infectious disease epidemiology also collect data on for example mio cardio infarcts etc. But explain it now with infectious diseases. So you need a health problem but you want to. Moni tour. You have to then systematically. Collect your data. For it to be efficient you have to have one. Clear case if a nation. You have to define where you. Obtain your data from and how to collect them. And it's always necessary that you don't monitor your health problem just for knowledge on the health problem but it is because you want to prevent and control further spreading of this.

                "text": "Welcome students. My name is shannon how fast i'm working as a medical doctor at a municipal health service crazy day in dutch. And now i'm a fan also at the university medical center. Today i'm going to explain you about infectious diseases epidemiology and. First i will start with a kind of general introduction on infectious diseases and also its correct risks of epidemiology. Because why do we have a special lecture on infectious disease epidemiology. In a way it's very much the same as non infectious disease epidemiology. Is the same way of thinking the same terms. Use the same study mess it's the same minutes of collecting data and the same data and then as this but. What is different. That's on the next slide to some special features in infectious disease epidemiology. Which is different is that a case may also be an exposure. If you go to. And the normal or the non infectious disease. Epidemiology. For example your may. Exposure may be smoking and. The result in the case may be that is. Leads to lung cancer. But then the exposure will never go to case will never be exposure again but an infectious disease that is different. If one person has measles. And it's exposing another person to measles then that's the first case can be an exposure for the next person again so that is unique and infectious disease. Disease epidemiology it makes it sometimes also difficult. But also interesting. Furder. Some paper. People may be immune or none of fictious disease epidemiology epidemiology you can never be immune for example for hypertension or lung cancer. But an infectious disease. Jihads. Some cases won't get the infectious disease because the i mean you know already. Thirdly it's important to understand that some cases although day have the disease. And although they are infectious. They won't show symptoms so you won't recognize them as a case. That's also something which you have to count on in investigating infectious diseases. And lastly what is important that there's sometimes a need for urgency especially in outbreak situations. When an outbreak of course you want to eliminate the source as soon as possible because our break leads to more. Cases and more desk maybe. So you have to speed up your. Your actions. And that's also a different aspect if compared to non infectious disease epidemiology. Then i want to go back a little bit in the history and explain you the role or the importance of infectious diseases. And that's what you can see in this graph from the usa. It's. Provides date out. Mortality rates and the black line is the top line. It's the mortality rate of all courses all courses so noninfectious and also infectious diseases. The blue is an all infectious and infectious diseases. And what you can clearly see is from one thousand nine hundred ninety eighty. And later that night fictious courses the mortality rate. Was actually quite stable over time. But that infectious diseases causes mortality rate. Decreased very much from beginning one thousand nine hundred ninety sixty. And it's also the same pattern you see down in the all causes mortality rate. So what is important to know is the cause of this tremendous reduction in mortality rates. And that's actually on the next slide. So you see the first two specks or control mechanisms which developed in the twentieth century. Were very important for this decrease so improved standard of living and. Installation of sewerage drinking water supply. So by. Only by hygene super super rich etc this. Decrease from nine hundred to nine hundred fifty. Existence. So you saw a decrease but you can also see that there's a huge peak. Just before nine hundred twenty. And it's huge because due to a tremendous number of deaths due to the spanish flu form around one thousand eight hundred. What is also important to know is that a lot of persons think that the decrease in. Infectious diseases is due to fix the nation and to be optics but that is not the case because to be arctic started to run. Nine hundred forty five. Fix the nation started around nine hundred fifty fifty five sixty. So actually after the decrease this very important preventive measures were developed. But they didn't have an effect on the. Huge increase. So to use diesel also in this light so i had to under micro grow beyond treatment and effects the nation. And the other two reasons said understanding the techniques and investigation of microbiology in epidemiology where making isn't for the scientists and later also for other persons. To understand the transmission routes of infectious diseases. So although. I showed you to divorce a huge decrease we still have infectious diseases and we still have such as these. So therefore it's yeah maybe for you to question why do we still have. Infectious diseases. That's because there are still changes which. Favored the emergence of new presidents i present you a few examples for example in ecological and foreign. Meant you see for example intensive farming in china and its will. May have led to the development of avian influenza. Due to behave. Behavior of people who travel a lot. You see also distribution of new or. Best agents. By traveling off. People you have spread of infectious diseases but also traveling in the next of food products because food products. Now a days are prepared. Or if it manufactured. On large scale and also distributed all over the girlz we have you have food items. Contaminated with infectious diseases they may spread. Very widely. And bioterrorism is something which is currently not so actual anymore about a few years ago in nine eleven. We did a tech in the usa. It was something which was really feared of. So which. Microorganisms did. Develop last decades for example here's a whole list of various microorganisms which are new in the last decades and. For example the crowds for jakob disease. The new variant of course bill jackalope in the u.k. in kettle meet the source which developed from china hong kong and. Reached canada and had a lot of persons who died it's of. Virus fifth. Leading to very severe respiratory syndrome. To fund them influenza. You may all remember that's the mexican flu or for two thousand and nine. And now. Recently or actually already two years ago. Virus develops. Which is very similar to sarce and also has a very high morbidity and mortality rate. But fortunately it's not transmissible from human to human and that's why we don't have so many cases. Yet but we are very afraid that this might become a larger outbreak. Do you have any idea of the impact of the infectious diseases i want to show you of a few sleights on this like you see the desk resulting from infectious and parasitic diseases and you can clearly see the main impact of course in africa. Actually in the whole of africa more a bit to south in part of africa. And that's also what you see on the next flight. These are desperate for children under five years olds. Until you see also due to infectious diseases that africa has the largest impact in the world and. Eastern mediterranean region in southeast asia. And it's. Malaria. Is more important africa compared to other countries. And on the right hand side. You see. Also global infectious diseases deaths for the total population so not only kill them. And you can also see that. Subsaharan is larger as compared to other regions. And inception herron aids is a very large factor and diarrhea. And in the global. Graph you see that aids is also important to book closures. Diarrhea and malaria. Then for you to understand how how you could control infectious diseases it's important to understand the transmission cycle of infectious diseases. You can always it's easy to start with the source of an infection for example a person having a flu. If a person with flu is coughing. He may transmit his. Flu containing droplets. To other person so he and next may expose other persons. They may become infected or deceased and day they'll become a source again. So actually that's a kind of to human to human transmission cycle. If you also have a. Infectious disease. Which is occurring in animals or in. Victorious. Who transmit. Infectious diseases. From i do or. Object or an animal to a human. Then you may also talk about a reservoir. But for disliked your i left it a little bit. Out of context. So how do you prevent or control in this cycle. And now one option is that you. Six hundred persons. If a person is fixing a says that after exposure. He may not or he will not become infected this person. And not become diseased. If you have an infectious disease for which you can fix the nates then for some infectious diseases it's possible. After a person has become infected. That you give prophylactics in order to prevent c.s.. For example if a person is. Bits in by a dork. Wave or a b.s.. You will give this person. A post exposure profile x. is giving him. Immunoglobulins and fix the nation. Against ray b.s. in order to prevent disease. Occurrence. And that. Treatment and disease say you. You understand that prevents. Morbidity death. If you have an infected often does or in diseased person live in severe infection or saffir disease. You may decide as a medical doctor was a public health organisation to isolate this person. In order for the person not to be a source of other persons that it was done in the mexican flu situation in the beginning. Persons visor days because of public health or medical authorities were afraid that it was a very severe type of flu. So people had to remain at home. In the last. Oh one option is what i talked about if you have animals effect as being a reservoir. You may do ecological management which sometimes. Means that you have to to eliminate this reservoir of animals off or vectors. And lastly for sure you can if. If you are a source of infection. If you do have flu. You take precautions not. To spread out his flow by covering your mouth when your coughing and coughing or using handkerchiefs. So in a way you won't expose your. Infectious particles to a lot of persons. So to summarize. There are some differences between infection and noninfectious. Diseases epidemiology explained to you. Last century or a century before from one thousand on that. You could clearly see a time trend over the hour and a decrease of day infectious diseases. Mortality and. You have to understand that there are several options for prevention and control of infectious diseases. And depending on the possibilities of prevention and control you can interrupt in the transmission cycle.",

You will see that something goes wrong. And you have to improve the thinking. In the exercise who have to do. This slight. Provides the rate of head and neck and neck cancer in smokers. brinker's. nonsmokers nondrinkers. And the combination of the two. Was these rates per one hundred thousand years from years. So that would imply if this is. These are the facts or do they know that among. Drinking smokers. You could ask the question what percentage of the hep heck. Neck cancers. Among these subjects. It's caused by smoking. Well then we have to look in this country ok what would be the. Rate. If these people would be nonsmokers and. Out of every twelve cases. There will still be three will remain. If they said those cases did not smoke. So seventy five percent. Are there. Because of the fact that they smoke. You could ask the same question. Among those who drink and smoke. What percent of the head had the neck and. Would be caused by drinking alcohol. So then we have to look at the other direction. Out of every twelve cases. There will still be four. If those cases. Did not drink. So eight of the twelfth that's sixty seven percent. Are caused by drinking. So that means that by smoking and drinking. We can explain. Eight plus nine is seventeen out of a total of twelve cases. That doesn't seem logical that it's not possible. So apparently. We make a fault or a mistake in our way of thinking here. Are intil to with of course that reason is not going well. But what is going wrong and is it to you to solve this question using a sufficient course component course model. I can rotman.

                "text": "In this clip. I will introduce you. Into the concept of. Counterfactuals. Maybe. Most of you have not heard about. Out of factual. So far. But at the same times. I'm quite sure that. It's a concept that you use in everyday life. Even without being aware of that. And counterfactuals. The way of thinking about it is. If you think in terms of. What would have happened. If it's a way of thinking that we all have. Of human beings. It's the tendency to imagine. Alternatives to reality. How would things have turned out differently. If only something else had happened. If i would not have done that if. Another thing would have been present in my life. Or. What if this had been different. What who would have happened. In a disease. But all of you. If only a certain fact or a. Must have been present a certain exposure wouldn't have been present at that time at that place. In that situation to that person. However this what if thinking is completely contrary to the effect that. We sting think about it. Given the fact that it has happened. So it's. Counterfactual to reality. That a has been present. And that fact. Cannot be changed anymore. So we can only know what happens in an auto wise. Identical case when all of us things are the same. Are equal. Although. All those things being equal. Can we ever created the situation to find out what a course is. In that case if you would like to do that if you. You would have read me to reroute the program of life style restart your life with a reset button. And do everything i exactly the same except. One thing. And then see what happens next thing you know what of course this means that you need to have an identical person. That is the same as you. On as many characteristics as possible. Except for this. Single one factor. This one. Exposure. A hypothetical twin. In the identical parallel universe of. First for instance. Well of course but that still is a mental exercise we can all the a real twin. In real life could be an alternative. Or it might be that you yourself. Could be exposed at one moment. And not exposed at another moment and see what happens. That could happen. Could. Could be you could be used. If you have short. Exposure direct effects etc. In a crossover study. But even then the time at which it happens and the conditions under which the exposures present and moms. Present is still different. So you will never find that person that. Exactly the same to you and only differs in this specific factors and. Even if you would find that person. You can never generalize the results to and the other person. Because it's a highly specific individual. Course. So how can we say anything ever. About causes them. If it's so difficult to arrive at this counterfactual. Comparison. Well the pragmatic solution. Is the randomised control trial. There used a group of persons. That's clearly defined. And relevant to your problem. Would you find this group. And then. Imagine your problem would be. Whether folic as sick as it is related to cognitive function changes in for caulking caulking to fiction and elderly. For instance after a three year period of exposure to folic acid. What would you do then you randomly assign the exposure folic acid. As a pressie bow. To a group of people. To the same god that originated from the same group. And you do this randomly. To get n.t. the comparability. Of these two groups. Because of this randomization. On average the. Exposed and exposed persons will be exactly. Similar on average. However all other factors that these persons have and that are relevant to the causation of these will vary and. They will also have their effect. But as the groups. Are on average the same forty will affect us. That affect the average out. So what you see in the end. Will be just the effect of the folic acid. So that's the way of using an r.c.t. as an answer a pragmatic solution to the to the counterfactual problem. That's also the reason that there are mice. Controlled trial is. At the top of what we call the evidence parliament. It's here and of course a summary of all randomized controlled trials on the same problem is even stronger but. Designed to run the most controlled trial is the gold standard. You could say. And all the types of studies like cohorts case console case series. Case reports etc etc. Can be characterized in a way and that's. That. The best things. Depends on the discrepancy between their design characteristics. And the r.c.t.. The less. Those differences or discrepancies in the sign. The lower the risk of the biases. The more the discrepancies. The higher the risk of bias. Will be. If you would start look at a controlled trial. And compare it to all the controlled trials as you do in systematic reviews and meta analysis you considering the external followed. Of our study. When we look at different designs and comparable to our city. We look at the internal. For liberty. And then of course. On top of that. We have to think about a better official logic. Mechanisms. As a biologic. A way of understanding. When we integrate. The evidence. So counterfactual in thinking. It's an intuitive. And logic concept. For thinking about celibacy. And the art of study design. Is to try to approach. The counterfactual approach. The counterfactual. Way of thinking. And to implement that in our study design. Randomised control trial. Is the pragmatic solution for counterfactual thinking and all the observational studies. Should be evaluated on the basis on the discrepancy from. This counterfactual model. From the discrepancy. From the us city. Espec medical solution.",

                "text": "In this clip i want to explain you why it's relevant. To think about causation. Causation is relevant to everyday life. And it plays a role already in the newspapers. For instance about an accident occurs like a ship that sank the costa concordia and his example. For the italian coast. Who has to be blamed. Was that a technical defect. Was it kept in that had drunk or was it something else. And what measures should be taken to prevent such events can happen again. In the future. Of course. When an accident like this happens. There are many things that go together with that event. That are associated with that event. But they are not necessarily. The courses. As an example of this. That it also happens in health and. Prevention is the relation between. Ice cream consumption and. The drowning. Of children. There is a very strong positive relationship between that. But it would make no sense to do to say that you should not eat ice cream. In order to prevent drowning. It has nothing to do with the ice cream because ice cream is not the causal factor. The causal factor. That's related. Is related to the fact that people in summertime. Tend to swim. A lot. Another example is the relation between. Chocolate and the nobel laureates. And you can imagine that it would make no sense to. Advice. Comfrey. To consume more chocolate. On a per capita basis. In order to have more. Nobel laureates. It's not the causal factor. But it's just something that goes together with maybe well for well being in a country and a high level of. Scientific developments in their country. So no causal factors. Would not be affective for prevention and. In fact. Sometimes they might even produce. Counterproductive results. If you think about the situations. Well as efficient. Could be many faults have many shapes. But you have to sort out. The ones that are a redo really matter. One of the way of sorting out is that the sister called this thing so there's a lot of attention for statistics in epidemiology. And there's also a lot of attention for studies and because if you have produced. The data or the data originated from floor study design. Then the results will be biased and you have an artifact that you are not studying the facts of nature. But. Biased results. One. When you have fulfilled. Those conditions. Your associations may still be co-founded. They may be on affect us. That are related to your exposure you are studying and that's of course themselves. And you have methods for adjusting for that may also be. Factors that are related. But not in a causal way. And we have to sort it out by scientific reasoning. We have causal factors. In the end. And we have causal factors. Even do understand the mechanism. It's note to note that the. Thing we are looking at or before. Identify. Causal factors. When you think about prevention and its reality. However factors like. Confounders are risk factors and effect is that even norm. Are known causally related to the disease. May be helpful in predicting the disease. So you could predict. The number of drownings. In a population. By by their ice cream consumption. In a population or during a certain period. In the year. But it doesn't help you. For prevention. To sort to make this. Selection of. Causal and non causal factors. We need. Course. Effect. Models are simple models. Complex models. Simple models like the core. Postulates that originated in the time of the infectious diseases. For parasites. One course related to one disease. Nowadays however. You have to do with. Complex diseases. Move the factorial. It's eulogy. Numbers of risk factors that act together and interact together to produce a disease. And we need guidance then. In sorting out of course as. Causal among causal factors. Biological mechanisms are one way to look at it. What is the way that the exposure or the agent makes from being the. Exposed to the disease what steps happen in the biology. To produce the disease that would have rolled us. Genetic and acquired susceptibility. Play a more severe that's a good model. Is the model. There is sufficient cause a component course model. And that accounts for. The fact that there may be different sets of of of course effect of that together produce a disease. And that the same disease. May be produced by different sets of factors that have only part of. All factors in common in a certain disease. So that's an other way of looking at it. But anyway we need this type of models. To the right click here to have criteria. To evaluate the strength of the scientific evidence. So it's very relevant. To think about causation. At a higher level of understanding because humans like to see. Causal associations. Even if they aren't all there. And that could lead to wrong inference. To wrong conclusions and to preventive measures. That do not work. And might even be counterproductive. And the you don't want to be cheated. So the complexity of the human biology. And a lifestyle. Cannot be properly understood without. Causal simp thinking. Causal thinking will not be easy. And it requires hard thinking. But it's certainly worth the effort.",

                "text": "In this clip. We will explain that epidemiology. Can be looked at both as an academic. Science and then applied science and in fact these two are complimentary. Aspects of the same thing. Two sides of the same coin. That belong together. A way to explain this is to start with. Thinking about what a clinician. Is doing. Epidemiology has a to do a lot with health of disease so that's a natural comparison. And what a clinician. Assent. Essentially is doing is tensely thing. Scientific knowledge about how the body functions how diseases my or. Her. What is normal function well this. Apology etc and the clinician translates this. Two questions to answer the question. What is the best treatment for this specific. Space and. So it's about. What's the best. And it's about the specific. Patient. The first has to do the best has to do with the notch. What the best of our knowledge. All the science is in that part. And the specific patient. Is the application. In a real life. Context so these two elements are present here. And that fence place also to epidemiology is. As you know epidemiology is about. Not about individuals but about the populations and. Therefore epidemiology in the academic setting. It's about the questions. Well the scientific questions the best three minutes in the clinical setting. But that's how can you be sure that the specific. Effect of the exposure. Is independent of the context of this person or population that's what science is about the general question. Is this always through its exposure always causing this disease. Or is this just. Chance or. An observation death. Has no causal nature whatsoever. But of the other hand. The epidemiology in the at them eulogist in the public health setting. Has to answer. Treatment question for a specific. Basin. Well. In this case not. At individual level. But in fact clear. And epidemiology just in a public health. Setting is a doctor for the population. As to who the diagnosis. And i to say ok given that. This is the health situation and this are these are the exposures in a population. This should be x. and i have to do now. I have to work on changing certain habits certain exposures. To prevent that at cetera. So what is the best prevention strategy for this specific. Population this specific risk group and. A good public health epidemiology combines the knowledge from the academic setting and. Their real life. Public health. Context. So another way to illustrate it is that in the academic setting. You could think about the. Epidemiology just as this scientific. Detective. Asking questions about who gets the disease. Or when in life or. In what circumstances. That's the disease. Occur. What places do people leave. What are the conditions. Why. What is the. The defect or that affects afflicts the occurrence of disease. So it's about analyzing the patterns. And the courses. Just like a detective. Aims to analyze and the stent. Who has done the crime. What in the end is the person who was responsible and. Detective tries to find the evidence. To come to where judgement. And say and this is the person or. This is the person who has done the crime. Well of the other hand. The public health at them eulogist. Is working on prevention. Of the crimes. So there the question is should we look our. Bourse in the evening. It's about. Is c.c.t.v. and effective means of reducing. Crimes and burglary. Etc. So that's the practical application in a specific context and. Epidemiology is about using the scientific information for prevention in populations. And that can be done through policies to. Programs to specific in the fence and depending on the place for the public health. Epidemiology is is working. And this seems to be a sort of. That discrepancy or conflict between these two applications but. In fact they are two sides of the same coin. In the economic setting. The focus is on. Generating more that knowledge. On things that are general. Generally a political. While in the public health setting this is a plight. And then you go from one to the other. When you go from the academic setting you know for sure that the certain factor. Might be a course. But when you apply that in a specific situation you also have to do is all the causes of the disease you have to do with the context was the ability to change certain things with existing policies etc. And you have to incorporate that into the design of your actions. While at the older hands. When you are in the academic setting. You start with the real life setting where all the factors are presence all the different. Determinants of disease all the different exposures are present. There is a wide array of. Disease health and disease patterns. And then you have to figure out what you can eliminate what factors do matter and what factors do not matter. In the end to figure out which are the causal factors. In a specific way that a general. Generalizable worldwide. So in the academic setting. Issues like the validity of the officiation and the exposure assessment theatre and the pursuit. In a very in importance. The to come to conclusions. On causation. Hume's that. All other factors. Are the same and the focus can focus on only the effect of. One specific factors. But in the end that we say. Well. If this persists specific facts or if doing something is a risk factor for all conditions. Then it is relevant to many kinds of anything. Time. At any place. But when you are in the public health. Setting. You use that information. And you apply it to say ok if this moment from the academic setting. Is also a pleasurable to my population. That's good to know. But to make it work. And to use it in this practical situation then you have to be sure that academic information is generalizable to your setting you have to be sure that the effect that you have. Determines in your analytical epidemiology academic setting that. This effect is also relevant and important. To the total health situation. In the population you're working it. You're using the best prep best practices within the societal context there. And it should be relevant to me here and now. But. To this specific population. At this time. At this place. So epidemiology and public health. It is about health and disease. And populations. It can be about against intestinal tract. It can be about the kind of physical a system can be. About being fit and active. It can be about mother and child can be about hospital care etc. But before death. And especially in the this. This discourse on the in the traditional epidemiology it's about nutrition it's about nutrients and about dietary habits. About the intake of foods. And that's means it's about fitness. It's about fitness it's about smoking. It's about alcohol. As main. Factors. To health and disease. And of course figuring out. More details on what's behind these rather rough. Observations what are the responsible factors. But you can take this is step further and say ok but why do people. Either would eat why do they have these habits. And that often has to do with a much wider. Societal context in the production of our foods. The food chain as a whole. How is our social and environmental and built environment. Organized where do we live. How what shops that we have how it is organized it has to do with our economy. It has to do with our health care et cetera. So. Epidemiology in the academic setting. Is then mainly about the right side of this figure given that we know the exposure of the v.f. method the exposure and the dietary exposures. The food the dietary habits and the intake. What. How does that affect the risk of a population. And what a causal factors. And often. The biomedical way of thinking is here. The basic underlying. Way of looking at. Courses. Of disease. But then we are in the public health setting. Often we want to change. The distribution of dietary exposures lifestyle factors etc and changing that. You can either focus on the individual who has to change his or her behavior. Or you can focus on the environment. That produces the conditions under which people show this particular behavior or. The interaction between the individual characteristics. And the environment. That together produce those behaviors. Well. There you are in the domain of the prevention and health both promotion. Changing these factors. In order to come to a different distribution of. Exposures which in the end sleeve two different. Hells and this is better. In a population. Another way. To visualize this is what we have called. The dish. Model. Where in the area of the production and the food chain the social built environment the societal context we talk about the determinants of diet and lifestyle that. The d.. About it. And that produces or leads to or shapes the conditions for certain intake of food and nutrients dietary behavior dietary habits. Which in turn. Affect the body. The status the nutritional states of the body. The function of the body different chanelle of tea the biochemistry etc. The nutritional status. And in fact. This middle part in taken state is that the classical domain. Of nutrition the research. And the right sites. When we ask the question how does. To get a fix the health and disease of people. Then in the classical epidemiology domain. What's the relation between intake status and. Health factors. So the right side of the very much biomedical. Why the left side is more related to the social factors human behavior etc and. These two domains. Need to work together. In order to prevent disease. In society. So epidemiology. Can we can distinguish both the academic. And the plight. Site of epidemiology and most relevant. To be effective. As an epidemiology just in research and in the applied setting.",

We can go on for a long time like this. Some people are lonely. Or are socially disconnected on or are socially. Very healthy. And it may be better luck and good luck. Just in the end.

Experience or everyday experience was motivate you to go dig deeper into. What's behind the real life. Health and disease. Of people in their life's. Epidemiology. Well you know the word. Epidemic. And it often refers directly to. Epidemics. But it's not only about the classical ideas of. Epidemic. There are new cases of this in a certain population group. During some period of time think about the flu. At certain periods in the year and there is a higher rate of flu. I was held as an epidemic. At this moment and that's in fact that there's a higher risk or more cases. Occurring in a certain time period than you have seen just in the recent period before. Higher than expected. On your previous experience. That with epidemics. Are about. And it also shows that the whole idea of epidemiology emerged from infectious diseases. But when the military. Develops furder. Also order words to describe disease patterns and to to give it a bit more details in that. Are the terms and their mic and their mic. Penda me is an epidemic. That's press corps a very large region. For example through a whole continent or even. Ruled by it you could think about the epidemic. As being a pandemic. Affecting afflicting. Populations of worldwide. When you think about. Endemic diseases. It's more true to stress the fact that it is a disease that is in a specific and vitamin that the specific place in a specific region. So is more the local nature. That is stressed in that bird could think about malaria in certain regions of the world. In certain whether are storms and things like that. So that's much more local. But you could also think about cardiovascular this disease or diabetes being. And then make this he says. In effluent western societies. Epidemiology. Yeah. It's the dirt is clear and it has been defined in epidemic logical. Textbooks in different ways. And if you look at the past fifty years. Ninety seventy. One of the first. Well make epidemiology just. In that time was. Mcmahon. And he defined epidemiology very simple as the study of the distribution and the terminals of disease. And you so see both the disease. And the determinants. That's a simple say. The course of the facts of the course the disease. Very commonly used. Definition. Is from. Last one hundred eighty three and. He has a more extensive. Definition. You still see the distribution. And determinants. In place there. But instead of the z's it now talks about the health related states and. Events. So it's a wider concept is not only just about disease but also about. Factors that preceded the health states. And then also at the turn population. Two to the definition. And that's indeed an important aspect of epidemiology that looks at populations. Rather than the individuals. And the search warrant. That is notable. No thirsty in this definition is that it talks about the application of this study to the control of health problems. So it's not only. Knowing about the distribution. And determines but also using it for a certain poem per post. And others to act upon it. And that relates very much to the very start and the very first life that i have presented. What motivates you to do epidemiology. You want to make a difference. In real life. Of normal people. And then in the end that the most recent a more recent definition. Is by weapon and maim and. It's much shorter but in fact it's still kept you're still sensuous. Of. Definition by lost. It says that epidemiology is about measuring health's. So the disease. In the earlier definition. Has been replayed. By health. And it identifies courses of ill health and. Into of and it's on. Interfering to improve health. So the study to control health problems of control of health problems. Is translated to interventions. To improve health. To the action. So what is epidemiology in the end in a very simple way about. It's about discovering patterns and discovering patterns. Is not easy. But when you see them. You cannot deny them they're clearly there. So if you can identify the patterns of health and disease. In a large amount of information on a number of. Lifestyle factors in the traditional factors. Etc and the number of possible health outcomes. Then. You've done a god good job. And to do that you need a very systematic. And they'll assess of the data so that's also part of epidemiology the way of discovering the partner. The pet terms. And this all is aiming at understanding those but thems and in the end to prevent disease. To maintain health. By interventions. So that's what epidemiology. Is about.",

                "text": "Welcome in this clip. I will look back with you on the module on milk and bone health. I will give you the broth picture. Because in the month you are you focused on a lot of details. And now we take a step back and see if there are some general principles. To learn from this module. Do you see the topic of this model. You are studying. Milk intake. Because you mean tick. And the effect is almost you bro sis. Or fractures. But of course there are a lot of steps in between. If you take milk. You consume more far to mindy. And you have certain levels of vitamin d. and calcium and. You have something happen with your bone within your body. And then you have a certain bone mineral density. And in the end. You get osteoporosis. Or knots. And what you did in this mall you were studying. A lot of different studies. You start with an animal experiment and animals experience. Focus on mechanisms. Most of the time or a lot of details about what happened in the body. So you focus on separates individual. Subscripts. You also study it and human intervention study. And in this study. You look at milk intake. You mean thick. People got some calcium supplements. And you studied what happens with bone mineral density. And finally we have a professional studies. So just looking around in a population and studying people in real life. What they would eat an already healthy or not. So again. Exposure. Is the intake but the out call off. Observational studies. Are most of the time. These. Peace or health. And because these are. Most of the dime large studies. With a lot of subjects. There's not that much. There are not that much possibilities to study. The intermediate steps. So. Blood levels or. All the biomarkers. And that it's possible. Most of the time. In the intervention studies. Well first we take a closer look at the animal experiments. This is a very difficult part of the more you know a lot of listening to interpreting resul it's a lot of details. And again i try to take a step back and see the general principles. Why are we doing animal experiments or cell line experiments. Well. Because we have a lot of opportunities to really look into details details mechanician us and buy. Well for example. Because we have a difference. My small bills. In this case. Normal my. But also something went wrong. For example mice in which there are no active for timing. The reception the cells. Well that's not something you can study in humans. But if there are my small goals. You can do it. And all her strengths of this kind of studies. Is that you can if. Difference going to. Diets. And in this case i call slim diets. But also fights i mean d. injections and all the different types of diets are possible and you can study. Very detailed information. In the body example cause you left us in the blots. But also in this case. The length of the bone. And that's also something that's not really possible. In human. But you don't. Because you don't want to give people something that's alters their bone lives. But then animal experiments. You. Disposable. So i will not focus on the results. That's what you'll get in the more you will. But the. There are some general principles. Telling you right to do. Animal experiments. And you'll see the results of this experiment. Far from india and the far to me. D. of scepter. Are in for. Well. Now we have a striking resoled first. Look at the. Intervention studies. Most trials show the boss the defect of milk intake and cost him one bone mineral density. But let's comparative studer observational studies. Studying a free living will predation. In those studies. The results are inconsistent. And some fairly recent and largest studies. Didn't show an effect of milk in tick. The frick here a risk. So these results are inconsistent. And by are these. Resells inconsistence. Well. Part of the clue is in this. Ching several prospective studies showed that low ball mineral density. Was associated to trick to risk. So evidence. That's. This jane. The school system. But all of the fractures rule one who didn't have a low. Bone mineral density. So maybe distain is not that strong. If. Hall full of fractious. Or q. or. Even if here it's nothing wrong. So that's me. Ok if you saw my id right. You have inconsistent results. So you see that. Using this kind of diagram helps you to order. All results and to look critical. To all your resells. And of course you also need to be to create a need to look critical to the individual studies. Because there are a lot of differences between those approaches. For example to study population. In animal experiments you study. Relation is federal. Very homogeneous. All animals live in the same room. In the same gate with the same. Laertes and so on. Well if you study. A free living human population. The population is fairly heater genius. People behave differently if different. And so on and the human trial. Is in between. You can controls. Some things. But not everything is possible to council. And the same as with exposure. In this case. Milk or cos you intake. You can control it in fairy detail in animal experiments. And here you only observe. And in human intervention trials you can also control. Your exposure. And if you can't control your exposure you just gift people a low or a high doses of. For example call some shipments. But then you may have a problem with compliance. Do people take the superman. Yes or no but you can have a very large school interest. Between low intake and high intake. Well in observational studies. You just study habits your intake. And most of the time the contrast between low and high. Is not that large. You just a study of what people do in their normal life. And there you have may have a problem of information bias. Do you really. Mesure. Know what people eat or not. Sometimes difficult to assess. And the same as with diets. He focused on the explosion of interest. And the whole remaining diet. Because people don't eat. Only milk or calcium. Well again in animal experiments very much controlled. Well in the facial studies. No control. And as a refilled. The maybe confounding bresson's an observational studies. All the other aspects of diets or. Older behavioral aspects. May disturb. Shift relation between milk intake. And to health i was going. Well. If you have more controlled study. Let's call phone in his presence. But also with respect to the outcome there are differences. Are a already explained that in animal experiments. It's possible to look at b.u. markers of. Intake or of star status. Well in all facial studies. Most of the time. You you've looked at health outcomes. Well. And now. Now you have a lot of recent different studies. How to integrate these results how to get the total body of evidence. Here you see the evidence pyramids. I think you know it by now. It lists. Several going to studies with. Studies that provides a strong evidence for data intake health officiation at the top. And studies that provides. Lower evidence. More at the bottom. And of course. It's not always the case that's an extra day. Is better than a case control study. Because a not so well conducted s. day. Not necessarily provides more evidence than a very welcome. Look at case control study. So there's not a rule you can apply. You still have to think and to get yourself. And therefore we have more detailed. Big kiss and diagrams that helps you to judge the strength of scientific evidence. And this kind of diagrams. Not only gets to study type. But also the amount of studies. And how well the studies are conducted. And just to give you an example. Suppose you have some small. Human studies. Well then you are here on the evidence. And if you have more a larger human studies. The evidence becomes stronger and stronger. Let's suppose that you are here larger intervention studies. But. Observational. These contradict the results will then you move back on the scale of evidence. So you see. Much more details. But still not a step by step approach. And usually you need. A body of experts. Go in together. Looking at the whole body of evidence. And yet showing what is the final conclusion. So no rule. But still you need to think and in the end you can draw an overall conclusion. And this is not for example the world cancer research fund to do it. They roll. Conclusions. For all kinds of dietary intake and. All kinds of cancers. And they say it sets. All the confidence of the decreased risk. Or may be convinced of an increase of this. Or maybe they are not so sure. And to do this. The judge the number of studies the study type. The endpoints. But also the quality of studies. Everything is important. Well took if you know example. About photograph it and spina bifida. The scientific community is almost totally convinced that there is a decrease the risk so that's very clear. But what about milk and osteoporosis. Are you really can fins of a decreased association. Or maybe you say well. Eighty percent. Financed but the still may be limited evidence available maybe there is not a final study that's. Gifts to final evidence. So maybe we are not for a few yet. And not about cost him osteoporosis. Well this is up to you to get this kind of study if that's what you did in this in more detail. And maybe you don't have a final answer. Yet. Well that's. Scientific life there are not always. Final answers. But i hope in this model. Your learned how to approach such a problem. How to use f. the spirit of myth how consensus development. Goes. And so on. So that's your job as a scientist.",

                "text": "Welcome to day i'm going to introduce you to the more you are in the marsh trials. And the focus of this more you is on the assessment of liberty. He to see a whole list of studies. Like case control studies cohort studies. And here you have to randomised control trial. That's the focus of today. You see all those studies are lists that's from studies that provides a low f. against for a certain ratio between intake and health. And at the top studies that provide high evidence. And you see there on the my school trial. It's almost at the top of the spirits. And therefore because of called standard study design. Vi estis run the march at the top. Well there's a low risk of bias. And the internal political the into an affinity. Is very high. So that's the reason that a randomized trial is called a cold standard. Well. This trial is what you are going to studying in this model. You see the first debate. As you see the topic of this morning is in take a photograph it's. And its effect on the court and to functioning. In the elderly people. So if they take photographs it's. If they had their cognitive functioning improved. And as you see here. Most part of this more you'll focus on the facility. It means. If you see the results of this study. Do you really trust. The refills. Are do you three still fillets. Or are to some areas. So that's the question you are going to answer it is more you hear you see in the fairy important bits of the model. This back and back again all over the model. At first start. It's seems that there is a lot of information on this. But what it shows. Are just the steps. You are going to do in this. First you see the populations. You are going to study. Well you're studying. An elderly population. So that's two population of interest and. Then you will see some results. And if you study the resorts. They will shown in that box. But the most important question is are these results from it. So these steps. Steps four five and six. Are the most important. You are going to look at selection endorse information or if and maybe confounding expressions and every time you study such a topic. And you will come back to describing. You will find more information. So all the results of your studying is summarized in this page. So at the end. Dissipates gives you a complete picture of everything you did. The a c. an expat or. Bates of the module. You see this is an exercise. It looks like the kind of personal you are going to solve this bustle and the whole model will consist of this kind of exercises. So you are studying by doing. Just doing exercises and then you will learn about the rent differ in the trial. Built. This exercise is about the populations. You are going to direct all these boxes. To the right place in the diagram. And in this way you are going to figure out how your population will. Looks like. These are elderly people. But what about their medication and. What about the thesis. Are people that this use is included yes or no and that's something you are going to decide. So this is the way you are going around in this model. Doing a lot of exercises. And please note to to remind us you're going to study. Because if you want to solve these exercises of course you need to understand a lot of to yuri. And. Theory. You can find here. So it's almost time to start with and what you. I will shortly summarize the learning objectives. As are set you are going to look at a randomized control trial and your most important task is to see if the resul softish trial fell it. So you will look at the information bias. Selection bias. And confounding bias. And maybe you are not yet filmy familiar with these terms. That's not surprised them. Because that's something you are going to learn. And maybe you notice are going to of. Terms that are used in a pretty logical resul it's the shirts. So you are looking at the effort the more you will from a logical point a few. And this be fair to all the modules. Yes case control studies and covert studies. So it is an epidemiological. Way of looking. So now it's time to start with the more you. And find out of this. But on the my school trial can be really a gold standard study design or not. Well. And joy.",

                "text": "Hello welcome to the third clip. On multiple regression. In this clip we go on to discuss the t. test. Conference in the fall and. Prediction. Let me first show you where we are on the map. So we started with a discussion of the multiple regression model at least squares estimation and after that we looked at the you know for a table in the f. test. And now we're here. And we start with a t. test. In multiple regression. The. This is procedures for estimation and testing of individual coefficients be the j. level prediction are similar to those in simple simple requests. So the t. test for an individual. Slope b. to j. uses. The test that is the key. Which is the least ques estimate of b. to j.. And you subtract the value. Specified in the no hypothesis and you divide by the standard error of the slope. Typically this value that you test against is zero. A comfort in the hole for the slope be to js the find s.. The squares estimate. Person minus the standard error of the slope times the point from the t. distribution. Typically the alpha is equal to five percent for a ninety five percent confidence interval. And the degrees of freedom is n. for the t. distribution is n. minus capers one. With case in the press for ninety five percent confident a full five percent. This t.. Value. Is close to two. Usually it's a bit larger than to. The closer to sort of confidence interval. Is the estimate. Plus or minus two times the standard ever. We look at. Yes the mation of a mean response. At new values of x. one two x k. And we look at the. Prediction of a new response. Which yields the same value actually the formulae for stener there is a for the coefficient coefficients themselves. Are different in multiple regression compared to simple of aggression. But. The results can be read from the output by the. sadistical software program so we don't bother. Again we look at the. Weight loss data. The response of why is the. Weight loss of. Some chemical compound in grams. As related to the exposure time in our. Effect with four levels four five six seven x. two which is. Develop the humidity during the exposure. We have twelve experimental units. And we fit a multiple regression model. And here is the. If it is refreshing play my least with. So we focus on the t. test for a single regression coefficient dow let's focus on b. to choose which is the slope for humanity. The new hypothesis states that. There is no humanity effect. Be to two his zero first is the alternative hypothesis to be the two not equal to zero. And we used the t. test so here's the output from our that we can use here are just the least squares estimate of the coefficient. Here is the standard ever. And if we take the estimate of the square system that subtract the value under the no hypothesis which is zero here and to five by the standard error we arrive at minus two point eight two three. The value that you see over there. We compare with the t. distribution with and minus capers one. Nine degrees of freedom and. These degrees of freedom are connected to the lead wafer estimation of the research of a fairly insecure square epsilon. Let's focus on the p. value of the t. test the p. value. Is given here by our point zero two zero. Well we arrive at such a p. value have to look into t. nine distribution. The outcome of the test that is the case here. Minus two point. Two three and a pet peeve value that we need here is twice the pink area. As two times point zero zero nine nine. Equal two point zero two. Which is mentioned here in the our output. We find people use small of the five percent so we reject the no hypothesis and we conclude that. He made it he has a negative effect here. Here's an exercise. So suppose we want to test the same no hypothesis but first is the alternative hypothesis that beat two is negative small of the zero. Which is a more logical alternative hypothesis because we expect weight loss to decrease if you mean the t. increases the distance. That's the to stick he says before the outcome is minus two point two three. He was the t nine distribution. But what's the p. value now. And what your conclusion. And what if the alternative hypothesis. Is to be to two is larger than zero. Well here's the answer. First the alternative hypothesis be to two negatives. So the p. value actually sleeping area. In the left of the t nine distribution to the left of the outcome minus two point two three. This b. value is zero one let's say. If you base it on the two sided p. value from the our outputs. We take the. Two sided p. value and if we divide by two. To arrive at point zero one as well. Smaller than our five percent. So we reject the no hypothesis. So we conclude that we found evidence for this. Alternative hypothesis. What if the alternative hypothesis is better to larger than zero. In that case the p. value. Feluda we need is the blue area it's this large area. To the right of. Minus two point two three and the teen and its the pollution which gives you a people you equal two point nine nine. If you base it on the two sided p. value from our you have to do one minus point zero to defy to buy two during the same. P.. Equal two point nine nine. Which is much larger than the alpha. Of five percent. So we do not find evidence for this alternative hypothesis. Naturally. As we already. Estimated the slope to be negative so we never go on to conclude that it is a positive next to confidence in the fall for an individual slope. And into full confidence in the fall for b. to j. consists of all these values of b. to jerry that are likely on the basis of the data. Well let's take one example. Value. Minus four point one four one four beat or two. Which is actually the least quiz estimate. Be the two had itself. Well that is certainly considered likely. If you would put it into the test. If you would test but it would be to my be equal to minus four point one four one. You will find that that not office is enough to reject it. So it will be part of the confidence interval. Actually it's in the center. The confidence interval for b. the two. And the standard error. Of the slope be to two had will tell you which order. Larger or smaller fell use of b. to a lively as well. So let's construct this. Confidence interval. So the point estimate minus four point one four one is in the center of the. Confidence interval. And we have a lower bound. And we have an up about. And how do we arrive at the lower band while we take the least quiz is the met minus four point one four. Given here in the our output. And we subtract. Fell you off to eighty nine distribution. Actually does two point two six to its this value from the teen and distribution. For the tail areas to an office sent. And we multiply with the standard error of this low one point four six. Seven. Which is given here in the are put in the lower bound is minus zero point four six. The upper bound. We take the least where system it. And we at the point in the t. distribution times the standard error. Yielding minus zero point eight two three. With a function. Confidence. We get those. Confidence intervals directly. Here we find the same results. So when ninety five percent confidence in the fall for b. to two is equal to minus seven point four six to mine this is zero point eight two. All these failures of beat or two are likely. According to the data. Next we look at estimation of. The mean and. Prediction suppose that we want to estimate the mean weight loss. You chemical substrates for which the exposure time. X. one was equal to five point five hours. And humanity. Next to it with two point five. Well these values did not occur in the data set. And we would like to predict. Estimate what the mean weight losses. Well. Just fill in those failures facts one the next two. In the us the made to the equation is the least ques estimate of the intercept. Of slope b. to one of slow be to two. If you do the calculations we get an estimated mean. Weight loss equal to four point eight six two grams. The prediction y. had for an individual substrate with the same values of x. one an x. to get the same value. By had is equal to be desirable to one at x. one b. to do it x. to push the ever but the best guess for an error is equal to zero so in the end y. had is equal to mewe had. With our. We get these predictions in the following way. First we have to define the data. The ring. Vesa failures for which we won't have to predictions. So high point five for x. one point five for x. two and. We predict. With the predict. Function at d.d.'s request a fair use and using the linear model object. And one. We hear we also ask for the standard ever. And we ask for a comfortable for the mean so here is the estimate four point eight six to estimate new hat. Here is the standard you had. And here is the lower and the upper bound of the ninety five percent confidence interval for the mew four point six two plus or minus a point from the ti nine distribution times the standard error to meet the prediction of a new response via the same fell you four point eight six two. In summary. The test. And the confidence interval for individual coefficient peter j. are handled as a simple regression. So for the no hypothesis to j.c. for the zero we use a t. test with a test that is the t. is the ratio of the estimate. The squares estimate minus to tell you one of the know how of a hypothesis the father by the standard error of the slope in the crease of freedom for the t. distribution as a z. and minus cable as one a confidence in the full for an individual slope. Is defined as. The least ques estimate of the slope. Plus or minus. Points from the t. distribution. Times the standard error. Speaking for a ninety five percent confidence in the fall. We take. Yes the math. Plus or minus two times the standard error. The estimate for me responds. And prediction for a new response. Are the same. Thanks for your attention this year the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to the third clip. On multiple regression. In this clip we go on to discuss the t. test. Conference in the fall and. Prediction. Let me first show you where we are on the map. So we started with a discussion of the multiple regression model at least squares estimation and after that we looked at the you know for a table in the f. test. And now we're here. And we start with a t. test. In multiple regression. The. This is procedures for estimation and testing of individual coefficients be the j. level prediction are similar to those in simple simple requests. So the t. test for an individual. Slope b. to j. uses. The test that is the key. Which is the least ques estimate of b. to j.. And you subtract the value. Specified in the no hypothesis and you divide by the standard error of the slope. Typically this value that you test against is zero. A comfort in the hole for the slope be to js the find s.. The squares estimate. Person minus the standard error of the slope times the point from the t. distribution. Typically the alpha is equal to five percent for a ninety five percent confidence interval. And the degrees of freedom is n. for the t. distribution is n. minus capers one. With case in the press for ninety five percent confident a full five percent. This t.. Value. Is close to two. Usually it's a bit larger than to. The closer to sort of confidence interval. Is the estimate. Plus or minus two times the standard ever. We look at. Yes the mation of a mean response. At new values of x. one two x k. And we look at the. Prediction of a new response. Which yields the same value actually the formulae for stener there is a for the coefficient coefficients themselves. Are different in multiple regression compared to simple of aggression. But. The results can be read from the output by the. sadistical software program so we don't bother. Again we look at the. Weight loss data. The response of why is the. Weight loss of. Some chemical compound in grams. As related to the exposure time in our. Effect with four levels four five six seven x. two which is. Develop the humidity during the exposure. We have twelve experimental units. And we fit a multiple regression model. And here is the. If it is refreshing play my least with. So we focus on the t. test for a single regression coefficient dow let's focus on b. to choose which is the slope for humanity. The new hypothesis states that. There is no humanity effect. Be to two his zero first is the alternative hypothesis to be the two not equal to zero. And we used the t. test so here's the output from our that we can use here are just the least squares estimate of the coefficient. Here is the standard ever. And if we take the estimate of the square system that subtract the value under the no hypothesis which is zero here and to five by the standard error we arrive at minus two point eight two three. The value that you see over there. We compare with the t. distribution with and minus capers one. Nine degrees of freedom and. These degrees of freedom are connected to the lead wafer estimation of the research of a fairly insecure square epsilon. Let's focus on the p. value of the t. test the p. value. Is given here by our point zero two zero. Well we arrive at such a p. value have to look into t. nine distribution. The outcome of the test that is the case here. Minus two point. Two three and a pet peeve value that we need here is twice the pink area. As two times point zero zero nine nine. Equal two point zero two. Which is mentioned here in the our output. We find people use small of the five percent so we reject the no hypothesis and we conclude that. He made it he has a negative effect here. Here's an exercise. So suppose we want to test the same no hypothesis but first is the alternative hypothesis that beat two is negative small of the zero. Which is a more logical alternative hypothesis because we expect weight loss to decrease if you mean the t. increases the distance. That's the to stick he says before the outcome is minus two point two three. He was the t nine distribution. But what's the p. value now. And what your conclusion. And what if the alternative hypothesis. Is to be to two is larger than zero. Well here's the answer. First the alternative hypothesis be to two negatives. So the p. value actually sleeping area. In the left of the t nine distribution to the left of the outcome minus two point two three. This b. value is zero one let's say. If you base it on the two sided p. value from the our outputs. We take the. Two sided p. value and if we divide by two. To arrive at point zero one as well. Smaller than our five percent. So we reject the no hypothesis. So we conclude that we found evidence for this. Alternative hypothesis. What if the alternative hypothesis is better to larger than zero. In that case the p. value. Feluda we need is the blue area it's this large area. To the right of. Minus two point two three and the teen and its the pollution which gives you a people you equal two point nine nine. If you base it on the two sided p. value from our you have to do one minus point zero to defy to buy two during the same. P.. Equal two point nine nine. Which is much larger than the alpha. Of five percent. So we do not find evidence for this alternative hypothesis. Naturally. As we already. Estimated the slope to be negative so we never go on to conclude that it is a positive next to confidence in the fall for an individual slope. And into full confidence in the fall for b. to j. consists of all these values of b. to jerry that are likely on the basis of the data. Well let's take one example. Value. Minus four point one four one four beat or two. Which is actually the least quiz estimate. Be the two had itself. Well that is certainly considered likely. If you would put it into the test. If you would test but it would be to my be equal to minus four point one four one. You will find that that not office is enough to reject it. So it will be part of the confidence interval. Actually it's in the center. The confidence interval for b. the two. And the standard error. Of the slope be to two had will tell you which order. Larger or smaller fell use of b. to a lively as well. So let's construct this. Confidence interval. So the point estimate minus four point one four one is in the center of the. Confidence interval. And we have a lower bound. And we have an up about. And how do we arrive at the lower band while we take the least quiz is the met minus four point one four. Given here in the our output. And we subtract. Fell you off to eighty nine distribution. Actually does two point two six to its this value from the teen and distribution. For the tail areas to an office sent. And we multiply with the standard error of this low one point four six. Seven. Which is given here in the are put in the lower bound is minus zero point four six. The upper bound. We take the least where system it. And we at the point in the t. distribution times the standard error. Yielding minus zero point eight two three. With a function. Confidence. We get those. Confidence intervals directly. Here we find the same results. So when ninety five percent confidence in the fall for b. to two is equal to minus seven point four six to mine this is zero point eight two. All these failures of beat or two are likely. According to the data. Next we look at estimation of. The mean and. Prediction suppose that we want to estimate the mean weight loss. You chemical substrates for which the exposure time. X. one was equal to five point five hours. And humanity. Next to it with two point five. Well these values did not occur in the data set. And we would like to predict. Estimate what the mean weight losses. Well. Just fill in those failures facts one the next two. In the us the made to the equation is the least ques estimate of the intercept. Of slope b. to one of slow be to two. If you do the calculations we get an estimated mean. Weight loss equal to four point eight six two grams. The prediction y. had for an individual substrate with the same values of x. one an x. to get the same value. By had is equal to be desirable to one at x. one b. to do it x. to push the ever but the best guess for an error is equal to zero so in the end y. had is equal to mewe had. With our. We get these predictions in the following way. First we have to define the data. The ring. Vesa failures for which we won't have to predictions. So high point five for x. one point five for x. two and. We predict. With the predict. Function at d.d.'s request a fair use and using the linear model object. And one. We hear we also ask for the standard ever. And we ask for a comfortable for the mean so here is the estimate four point eight six to estimate new hat. Here is the standard you had. And here is the lower and the upper bound of the ninety five percent confidence interval for the mew four point six two plus or minus a point from the ti nine distribution times the standard error to meet the prediction of a new response via the same fell you four point eight six two. In summary. The test. And the confidence interval for individual coefficient peter j. are handled as a simple regression. So for the no hypothesis to j.c. for the zero we use a t. test with a test that is the t. is the ratio of the estimate. The squares estimate minus to tell you one of the know how of a hypothesis the father by the standard error of the slope in the crease of freedom for the t. distribution as a z. and minus cable as one a confidence in the full for an individual slope. Is defined as. The least ques estimate of the slope. Plus or minus. Points from the t. distribution. Times the standard error. Speaking for a ninety five percent confidence in the fall. We take. Yes the math. Plus or minus two times the standard error. The estimate for me responds. And prediction for a new response. Are the same. Thanks for your attention this year the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to the second clip. On multiple regression. In this clip we go in to discuss the a no for table. And the f. test. First i would like to show you where we are on the map. So earlier. We discussed the multiple regression model and least ques estimation and now we continue with you know for travel. And the artist. The data that we go on to look at again. Are the weight loss data where the response is why is the weight loss of some chemical compound measured in grams. And this y. is related to two x. one. The exposure time to air. Measured in hours. Which is an experimental factor with four levels four five six and seven. And also in relation to x. two which is the relative humidity of the air during. Exposure which is an observed. Value in total we have twelve. Experimental units. Recall from simple regression that you know for table is about three sums of squares. We have a total sum of squares. Connected to the response itself. We have for every question someone squares as s. are connected to the systematic part of the model. And we have an ever so much quiz as is connected to the aerator absalom. Let's build such an a no for table for the data that we have here in little steps. Well step number one is right down the table with three rows corresponding to these three sources of variation in the heading that we will get something like this. Source total. Split into. Regression and. Ever. We have to different columns. What do we already know so we go to step two here. What do we already know we use least squares to arrive at the parameter estimates. And then the squares we minimized. The ever so much squares. So we have the s.s.e. already. Connect. It is as if either our mind escape was one degrees of freedom. Where k. is the number of requests. If we take the ratio. We arrive at the embassy which is the estimate or of the arraf areas. Or if areas of y. eliminating x. one. And x. two. If we use our to get these. Quantities we could do something like this we fit the model. With the alarm function. We used to function deviance to get the error some squares. We would this function the f. that we said you will we obtained. The error degrees of freedom and if we take the ratio we arrive at the embassy. And let's fill in those numbers in the table. And here they are. Please note that the embassy here is nicely in the center of the you know for temple. Step number three. Let's switch to the bottom row if you know how terrible the the road corresponds to the total. Well the s.s.t. may be calculated as a simpler equation but now we take a slightly different approach. We would like to know whether x. one and x. two are really needed here. So suppose they're not. Let's remove them from the model x. one. And x. two. Are removed from the model and we arrive at the model why is b. the zero plus epsilon in this model is called. The no model. It only contents. And in deception. Well it is a model. So we can use a least quiz to get an estimate of this be to zero parameter. And if we do it. We will find that the least squares estimate is just the ordinary sample me. So the ever so much squares of this no model is actually the s.s.t.. It's the sum of the squares of the observed. Sufficiency. Around the sample mean. We have n. minus one degrees of freedom here. And if we take the ratio we arrive at sigma square. Which is the estimated fare and so why ignoring x. when the next to it is just the ordinary. Sample fairy and. In ari. It looks like this. We fit this no model. We only have one here at the right hand side of this formula. Model formula. The deviance gives us. The ever so much quiz. Which is the s s t the total sum was question now thirty two point five. We have eleven degrees of freedom twelve minus one and. The ratio is the mystique. I fill it in. And you know five table in the bottom row. Another question for you compare the arrow sums of squares of the multiple regression model. The three point four two the arrow some squares of the no model. Thirty two point five. The question is which of the two models do you prefer. And why. Well i certainly prefer the multiple regression model because this. Everson was quest is so much smaller. Three point four. Compared to thirty two point five a small. Ever so much squares means that the predictions are much better the predictions are much closer to the observed values. So i would prefer the multiple regression model. Step number for. Let's fill in the row for the regression. The question is that we have is how much better is the multiple regression model compared to the snow model. And for that we can just take the difference between the s s t. And yes is he and this difference is the regression was ques that we need. We could calculate a different way. But this is the way we use now. We have. K. degrees of freedom which is the number of requests. As the third agrees of freedom poor as r. and if we take the ratio we arrive at the. Mean square. The real question. Here are the calculations done with r.. And if we fill in these numbers. We. We get the first part of the you know for table filled. Step number five. We would like through our answer the question where are all the slopes might be equal to zero. And for that question we use the f.. That's that the stick which is that of a show m. s. are over yemen. If x. one and or x. two are related to y. then we will find that the marines of to requestion will be larger than the mean square. Of the ever. So the ratio f.. Will be larger than one. If we do the calculations here. We find a failure thirty eight point one. So we find that v.m.s. r. is much much larger than the embassy here. Let's fill it in their egos. And then finally last step. We need to piece all you. For this new hypothesis. And by the way. Saying that all the beat us are equal to zero in which that would be something like the model has no explanatory power. How lauch should this be to prove that the no hypothesis is wrong. Well if the no hypothesis is true then this. Ass that is to be like her venom draw from an f. distribution. With k.. Which is the number off. Regresses two in our example. And and mine escape was one. Go to nine here. Decrease of freedom put in the nominator. The p. value. Can be obtained it r. with the p.f.. Function. And we find a fairly small piece value. Equal two point zero zero zero zero for a few words about these f. tests. So here you see the density for the f. distribution with two degrees. Two and nine degrees of freedom. The outcome of the test that this is point. One is located here actually it must be. Shown over here. So you see that is very far in there vital of the distribution. And the p. value is the area to the right of that. Thirty eight point one five. And it is fairly small. Point zero zero zero zero for. This be a smaller than the five percent. That we take. So we reject the null hypothesis and we conclude that the x. want to have predictive value for y.. So part of the fairy ation why. It's explained by x. one. And or x. two. Are has an function over. And if we would use that. Function we. We get an over demo which looks slightly different. So here's the a no for function. And here is the n.l. for table produced by r. what we see here is not the real question so much squares but we see some squares four x. one a four x. two. So d.s. is already split into different components this will be discussed in a later clip. Another thing is what we see here is that the total sum of squares is not given. So if we if you want to see the s.s.t. we. You need to do a little bit of extra work. For instance. In this way. Fitting the no model. Or in a more straightforward way of calculating the sum of the squares of y. around the meat. In summary. Comprises three simpson squares s s t s s r s's eat corresponding to total. Systematic i read the part. And in essence the end over to paris two models. The multiple regression model. With a no model. Containing only the intercept. And the regression somewhat squares. Is to difference in error since the squares of these two models. A larger difference as is our. Indicates stronger effort is evidence that the model has explanatory power. And to test the no hypothesis that. All the slopes. Equal to zero. We use an acid to stick. Which is the ratio of famous oral for amisom. And under the no hypothesis this af. F. distribution. With k. and minus capers one degrees of freedom. Thanks for your attention. I see you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Welcome to the course food chemistry. My name is julie advocate. And i'm one of the teach yourself this course. And i'm also the core denethor of this course. Now in this. Introduction clip. I'm going to introduce the. Course to you and also go into more detail in the course materials and the course schedule. So let's first talk about a content of the course. In this course we study. Food products. Gradients raw materials for example. If you look at the reaction down below you see sugar. Which is an ingredient. And you see. Cocoa beans. Which is a roman cereal. That we will study both. But we will also study. Real food products like a chocolate. A compost product. And we will study. What wills will be studied from this. We will study to composition of these food products. So we will look at to a diprotodons that are in there in the carbohydrates in the lippitt etc. And we will do that in a lot of the tools for example. About those leopards we will look at the fact the assets that are present in the lip it's. So we will look at the composition. But we've also looked at the structures of these food components how do they look like a nut. Next to the composition we will also look at. Changes that take place in food. Changes take place because during storage or during processing and. These changes are mainly gamma culture changes so we will look at the gamma call changes. How it changes the structural food components but also how this will change the composition our food product. Or how this will influence the quality. And the properties of the food products. Now i want to discuss the course cultural with you. You have fourteen weeks of education. Normally you would have lectures but. This is a distance course. So we have the fall of. All kind of knowledge tips for you. And we've provided all the learning materials. That you need to fire. Our website. Have divided up. The learning materials over the fourteen weeks. That you have. The first three weeks. You will work on carbohydrates. And this topic is taught by me that after those first three weeks we will work. Three weeks long you will work on proteins. So work. Week four to six. Which is thought by my colleague pizza of asian cup. Then in week seven nine. And a little bit and week ten. You will work on the topic limits which is again taught by me. And then. In return we will start to work on the components. Phenolic compound. And so week ten eleven and twelve. You will work on phenolic compound which is taught by my called a coffee cup. And then finally the last two weeks we will spend on. Anti mother. Reactions which is taught by my colleague. Kapil. Now then you've come across all the main topics of food chemistry. And you have your exam of course. And after the exam period you will have two weeks of lap classes. And in these lap classes you will be supervised by one of our colleagues. Now here you have pictures of the teachers involved in this course. So here is a picture of me. The course coordinator. And i'm in full thing called hydrates and lip it's. Them my our professor holly clipper who is teaching phenolic compound. Pay to view teaching proteins miriam kabal. Teaching enzymes. And then here. Who you will see. During the lap classes of this course. But if you want to know more about these teachers. Then you can go to our website and look up the introduction movies of each of these teachers and you can learn more about them. But i already told you that we've divided up. Our course materials over the week. And. For each week. We will tell you but you have to do that. Week. So for example in week three. You have to do several topics related to carbohydrates. So we have the file of several knowledge clips for you. And we will tell you which of the knowledge flips you have to look at. Than from our. E-book. That we will provide the blackboard site also we tell you which chapters of the ebook you need to study. We will also tell you which exercises you have to make. In week three. On which calculation case you have to work in week three. And finally when the question hour will be. And this week. Not normally a question hour will always be on friday at four thirty and. I also have to tell you that for the calculation cases we will provide. Time for you in a computer room. To work on these calculation cases. Not to get more. Acquainted with all the information that we provide to you i would suggest you to look at these instruction clips. We have an instruction clip on how to use our blackboard side. How to use our. E-book how to make the calculation cases. And also how to use the blocks that we will provide to you. Each week you will see a block of derisive students who shouldn't block. Where you can post questions and. You can answer questions of other students. And we will have a blog that will help us to know what kind of questions do you have for the life question. Now i hope you will enjoy discourse. And also. My teacher. The other teachers my colleagues. We all hope you will really enjoy our course.",

                "text": "And this knowledge clip. I'm going to talk about photo oxidation a flip it's. So it's one of the. Oxidation reactions that can take place in lip it's. Maybe you've noticed ones that. If milk has been standing in the light that. This milk has a different taste than milk that has been standing in the dark. And this is because. Because of the light. Liquid oxidation has been taking place in this field. On this knowledge clip. I'm going to talk about what kind of photo oxidation can start to take place in milk. And other food products. Now it's known already for a long time that the quality of fat the creases. When it is in the presence of flights. So from that we no doubt light. Trigger slip at oxford ation. And here is was a study in which do you have studied fish or in this case mackerel. And it was start. In the dark and into light and compared with each other and they've measured to peroxide values over time so over the story each day since the peroxide value is an indication of the amount of oxidation that has been taking place in the oil. And you can clearly see that when the product was stored in a dark. Much less peroxide. Was formed. Than when the product was stored in the light of this all has to do with how light. Triggers. Fat. Oxidation. How does that work. So in a. Oriel or in a fat. sensitizer presence these are molecules that are sensitive to light. Not to light hits the product and then the sensitizer takes over the. Energy light as energy. It takes over the energy of the light and becomes an activated sensitizer. This activated and sensitize or has much more energy. So it will react. Or you can have two types of sensitize or as we call them type one type two. When i talk about type one sensor size there's the nice. Enza ties are after they have been activated by light. These sensitizes react directly on the lippitt compound. And start a liquid oxygen reaction. The type to sensitize are sensitised search that. After they have been activated. They're not reacting with the lip at compound. But they are reacting with oxygen. And they are reacting with a triplet state oxygen which is drunk state of oxygen it's normal. Oxygen. And it turns it into. Singles oxygen. Which is more active state it has much more energy than the triplet option. And then this single oxygen reacts with the lipitor component. I will discuss the two and a little bit more detail. So first here to type one sensitizer. sensitizer to take over the energy of light. And then to activate it sensitizer. Reacts with a fatty acid. And affect the acids than turns into an a kill radical. In other words. The sensitizer that has been activated. Takes off a hydrogen from the fatty acids. So that the fatty acid turns into a radical. And then. Than this. A kill radical. Reacts further into how to oxidation reactions. But a type two reactions. Then the sensitizer thought are present in the food. Heart. Are lit. Hit by light. Take off. Take. In the energy of the light and becomes an activated sensitizer just as in a type one or only then to activate a sensitized the now reacts with triplets oxygen. Normal state oxygen. And the sensitizer is now not activated anymore. It gave its energy to the triple is oxygen and a triple is oxygen. Has turned into a single. Oxygen. This singles oxygen has way more energy than the triplets oxygen. And because of that this single it off children will die. Directly. React. On a sat fat molecule on the on the fatty acid. And from here directly. One hundred peroxide has formed. So no radical is formed. But a hybrid peroxide is formed. So this will not go into the out. Oxidation process from here. Now let me go into a little bit more detail for the type two. So this single it's oxygen. Very reactive. Oxygen will react directly on the double. Bond of the fatty acids. Now what you see here is double bonds. And now the. Singlets oxygen will react. I here on the ninth or. On the thun thun carbon of the fatty acids. If it react on the ninth. Than here. An option. Will attack. And the double bond. Will shift in that direction. And then this product here is formed. So hydroponic site is formed directly. If its reaction to thanks carbon. The oxygen. Here. Than the double bond will shift in that direction. And here the oxygen. Will react on it. So down on the tenth carbon. One hundred peroxide is formed. A good example as i sad to read in the beginning it's a photo oxidation of milk products. And its dairy products are very sensitive to light oxidation is because of this molecule. Riboflavin. Which is presence in in milk its fight him and be too. And it's a very strong sensitizer so when. This molecules hit by light. It takes up the energy it becomes activated. Then they will react with option. And turn your oxygen into the very reactive. Oxygen. And then. This reaction will take place that i just discussed. A hydroponics will be formed. But i have a question for you now that i've explained photo oxidation so you know that light has an influence on fat oxidation. Let's see if you can answer. Her discretion. So yeah. I'm talking about fat oxidation that limits. The shelf life of milk. And we can prevent this. Fat. Oxidation by. The struck of flight. By using a certain. Packaging material. Not it. Here in this study. Three types of. That packaging material were attached to it. So the milk product. Was eliminated with lights over time. And then the peroxide value is measured so. The amount of oxidation that has been taken place. And the three different packaging material are a nontransparent. Packaging material. A mono layer transparent. Packaging material. And the three layer transparent. Packaging material. Which of these three. Packaging materials belongs to which of the three lines. In the graph. So i guess it's not difficult to realize that when the packaging materials nontransparent. No light will go through. So. Almost no peroxides will be formed in this. Amount of time. So the nontransparent one is to the line down below. And then the transparent. Packaging material life will go through this material. But clearly. The more normally or transparent. Will have more. Peroxide forms. Over time than the three layered transparent. Packaging material so the three layers. Help. The profession. To prevent. Lippert oxidation. So to summarize. I've talked about photo oxidation and lip it's under influence of light. sensitizer has become sensitized nardo two types of photo oxidation. The first type. Is that the. Activated sensitizer directly react on the lip it. And the second type is that those activated sensitizes react with oxygen. And then turn. Oxygen into a single to oxygen. Then this single of oxygen. Directly reacts on the double bond off of fatty acids and turns it into a hydra peroxide.",

                "text": "When you have leopard oxidation. Don't suffer of products or forms. In this knowledge clip. The going to explain you the difference between. Primary oxidation products. From the production nation and secondary oxidation products from liquid oxidation i let's first look at to do. Overview of the reaction to take place and. I'll talk sedation. Here's the overview. First you have an initiation reaction in which the fatty acid turns into a radical then and the propagation reaction. This radical. Reaction to with oxygen into a peroxide radical. And then later just peroxide radical reacts with the fatty acids. And two hundred three peroxide. Now those radicals that are formed the peroxide radicals and a kill radicals. Can react with each other again. In determination reactions. But from all the reactions that you have here and from the reaction products. When we talk about the primary reaction products we are actually referring to here. To the hydra peroxides that are forms. These are the primary oxidation products in the fatty acid oxidation. Now those how drew peroxide which are the primary. Oxidation products are not stable they are very unstable. And because of that they will decompose. And they will decompose into what we call the secondary oxidation products. And these are mainly carbonel compounds or think of. Ketones and. L. the heights where you see the short structures of that and. These smaller compounds. Are relatively stable. Now what is the main difference between the two hundred per excites which are very unstable. Are nonvolatile. And they will not give any taste or odor to your products so you don't notice it yet. When primary oxidation products are formed. But we are when they are decomposed into to smaller. Sounds. These are full of tile. And they get a taste and smell. And these sort of predation products. These are the oxidation products such you will notice. And that is when you will notice the rancid smell or taste in a food product. So now here you ask a question for you. Here you see a small. Product it's hex inal it's a second r. oxidation product and. Maybe you can come up with. Fatty acids. From which the second. A very oxidation product could be formed from. Now here you have the answer. If you start counting the number of carbons one two three four five six. Then it's should come from fatty acid that has. Somewhere around. The six carbon has a double bond. Starting from the non acid site. So for example an old one got six fatty acid which has the first double bond on the sixth carbon. Could have been formed out of this. Yet. Did so hacks know could could have been formed out of an omega six fatty acid. So to summarize. I've talked about a liquid oxidation product and are two types of products primary. And second their execution product. The primary oxidation products are the hydro peroxides. These are non volatile. And they're very unstable and they will turn into secondary oxidation products which are smaller compounds like al the height in ketones. And these are very full of tiles and will give the oxidation smell.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip. Is about oxidation a flip it's or more specifically about. Outtalk sedation a flip it's not. Outlook sedation a flip it's is a gamma co reaction and it's an oxidation reaction and it takes place in the presence of. Of course oxygen. But also often because of you feel your revelation either happens between. During storage but if it can also take place during processing so food. Now the effect of. Out oxidation of lip it's pretty severe. You can get a lot of play for a loss of color loss of anti-oxidants. Also all kind of run off play first can be formed. And finally give to degrees and a nutritional value of the fat. And this knowledge clip. I'm going to discuss the outlook's tradition of flip it and. A lot of detail. Let's start with an overview. Heat here you see the three main steps in the outer sedation process first you have an initiation of the reaction. Then there is a propagation. And then there's a terminations reactions. Not all three reactions. As but of course first you need them but after initiation. All three reaction. Can take place at the same time. That started in each ation reaction. Now what you have is a fatty acid needs to be. Becomes oxidized. And this happens in the outlook's addition riddick catalyst a catalyst. Reacts with the fatty acid. And that the fatty acids. Turns into a kill radical than in the propagation. This kill radical reacts with oxygen. And then it turns into a. Peroxide radical. This. Peroxide radical. Can done. React. Again. With a second fatty acids which you see here. And then. This first peroxide radical that has reacted with a fatty acid. Turned into a hydropower excite. And a new fatty acid. Has turned in and. A kill radical. And that's second to kill radical can. Again react with oxygen. That is what we call there's a propagation reaction this reaction. Keeps on going and going because every time new. Radicals are formed. That can attack. Another. Fatty acids. At such or not this keeps on growing but there are also terminations reactions. I just think this thing goes three types of. Terminations reactions. And it's that the products react with each other so for example. Through a kill radicals can react with each other or. Approx side radical can react wouldn't kill radical or true peroxide radicals can react with each other if two radicals react with each other than. The products that are formed. Here are none reactive anymore and that is why we call them. Terminations reaction it stops. The out. Now i will discuss these reactions. Now in more detail. And the requirements of these. Oxidation reactions is that you need a presence of a free radical. Because that is what you need an initiation reaction. Also of course you need oxygen. That is what you need in propagation reactions. And the reaction can take place on saturday it is fatty acids but it's normally taking place on. Unsaturated fatty acids so you have you need. Unsaturated fatty acids in your food for fat oxidation. How can you speed up these reactions. Now high temperatures. Lall or high water activity and. The presence of pro. Oxidants like metal ions. This all speed up the oxidation reaction. Here now i will discuss the initiation reaction in more detail. How the. Look here at this try. It killed. So i have to back bone. And then three fatty acids. Russia jews. I'm going to look at one fatty acid dress and you hear it has one double bond and. It is that a radical if a radical. Attacks. A fatty acid it will always start at a double bond. This is what happens to catalyst. Will react with the carbon next. To double bun so not on the double bund. But one place for it or. It will substract. A hydrogen atom from this carbon. Not this is what you don't see. So the weakest hydrogen. Is now taken away that. And then here. This. Carbon here. Turns into a radical. Itself. Now that we have a radical. The first to the next reaction can start to take place. And that there's a rest in ns that takes place within the molecule. So this radical here. Will the fight itself. Over the double bond. Here. And the radical here. It will divide itself. Over this part of the molecule. And this resonance. Gifts the reason for the products that can be formed out of this reaction. After resonance. Now in the propagation. Oxygen. Appears and oxygen. Might react. Either on this carbon or. On that carbon. On one of the two. Because of the rest and then. They're equal in where the oxygen might attack. But in this case the option has to test a tax on that carbon. So this is not a peroxide radical that has formed. But it could also have reacted on that other carbon. And then the. Radical would have been formed. On the other carbon. Now this is the first part of the propagation. Soda reaction with oxygen and then we have a peroxide radical. And now this peroxide radical. Is a radical. And it. One's to substract one hundred one from a second. Fatty acid. That is what happens here. So here in new fatty acid appears. And this radical here. Will take all of this hydrogen here. And then. This molecule. Turns into a radical itself. While the peroxide radical here now. Becomes a parasite. So this is not a hydropower excite it's not a radical anymore. But a new radical. Is formed. And this is a kill radical. Will react again. With oxygen at such in the propagation reaction. Now and then the final reaction is determination reactions to. Radicals are reacting with it child or. Resulting in an none reactive product. And this normally. Especially takes place when the concentration of radicals is very high so if you have a lot of kill radicals. Then these two will react with each other and this is an example of a product that. How that looks like so to a kill radicals. Has reacted to each other in a final product. Here you have a peroxide radical reacting with in a pill radical or here you see the peroxide and. A kill. They wrecked the react with each other there is no radical anymore. Or if you have two peroxide radicals. Then you see the two double. Options here. And there is another oxygen still that. That. Also needs to react and that is to auction of that this. Form to guns who a new offshoot of molecules form back again. And this termination reaction. Now you've learned about the talks today shit about the. Three types of reactions that can take place in each nation. Propagation and terminations. Not a question for you so this is about the initiation reaction. Here i have three molecules and. I would like you to tell me which hydrogen atom. Will be extracted from the fatty acids by a radical in the initiation reaction do that for each molecule. Now here you can see it so it is always next to the double bond. So if you have to double bond here. Then it will be either on this carbon or on that carbon that the hydrogen will be extracted. If we're talking about two double bonds. And then. The hydrogen that is in the middle of the two double bonds. Is the weakest hydrogen it's the easiest to substract so that hydrogen on this carbon. Will be extracted. Earlier than for example the hydrogen here or there. And then when we have three double bonds. There are equal though. So do. The two in the middle between the double bonds are equal easily extract it so dish two will be extracted easier than for example this one. Or death one. Now i have a second question for you. How many different hydra peroxide can be formed from this. Fatty acids it's a lake as it has one carbon. One double bond home and the difference hydra peroxides can be formed. When this. Fatty acid is. Oxidized. Now here are the answers. Because it is a single bond. The hydrogen will be extracted either here or there. But after the extraction you will gather resonance. So the resonance will be eiter here. Or. The russians will be i will be here. And because of that reason. The oxygen. Can attack on four different places. It could attack here. Or that for the first russian instructor or here and there. For the second. Russian and structure and that is why we can get four different hydra peroxides. One on the eleventh. And one. On the eat one. On the ten and one. On the nine. Ok so summarize. In this knowledge skip. I've talked about how talk sedation a flip it's not takes place in three steps first you have the initiation reaction. This is where fatty acids react with a radical and. A kill radicals or forms. Then you have to propagation. Where to kill radicals react first with oxygen hydro. Done hydro peroxides are formed and new kill radicals are formed. And then in a termination reaction. The radicals react with each other and then non-reactive products are for.",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this clip. About confidence intervals and prediction. In simple linear regression. First i'm going to show you where we are on the men. We're actually over here. We have only one clip to go. We have talked about. Estimation. And testing and now we're going to talk about conference intervals and prediction. The leamy data will be used again. We have to ten carcasses. We have. The percentage lean. Of each carcass the response. We have to set that measurement. The explanatory variable. We want to predict. Y. from x. to a conference in the fall for be the one actually consists of. All values for b. to one that are likely. On the basis of the data. Like a value of. Minus zero point seven five. That's considered likely. When the knowledgeable to say is that b. to one is minus zero point seven five. Is not rejected by the t. test. When the size of the t. test is usually. Point five. The confidence level of the interval will be one minus alpha. Which is point nine five. I will tell you more about it later. Now. Here you have a line. Running from left to right. And it consists of all the values. They'd be to one can take. We're going to start to walk along the line. Will pick up values for b. to one along the way. We put them in the t. test. And we'll see whether they are rejected or not all these values are rejected. An example is value minus one. Which is rejected by the t. test. All these values. Are simply too small to be matching up with the data. After a while you get into a green area. These are all the values that are not rejected by the t.t.s. and example. Is minus zero point seven five which is not rejected. And finally when you walk on. You enter into red. Territory again. Because these are all the values will be the one that are too large to match up with a data like fail you minus zero point five which is again. Rejected by the t. test. So the area in the middle of all the values that are not rejected. That is to conference interval. Now this is a rather elaborate procedure you might think. To decide what the lowest. And the highest value in here is because you have to do so many tests but fortunately. You can show. With a little bit of algebra. That the lower bound. Is actually the. Estimate and the estimate is from here. Minus a multiple of the standard there. Which is from here. And the multiple itself. Is from a t. distribution. Degrees of freedom are eight. From the sum of squares of error. And a two point three one actually. Over here is the point. With area. Point zero two five. To the right. Point zero two five. Is half. Of point zero five it's a two sided test. You so you have. Off on each side. The upper bound. Is looking very much the same. Except that we have a minus sign here. And a plus sign there. So if you plug in these this information. You get a lower bound of minus one. And an upper bound. Of minus zero point six one. And had to fall is actually from minus one. To minus zero point six one. The lower in the upper bound. Are kill q. lighted. From the data the data are realisations. Of then the variables. So the lower in the upper bound. Are realizations. Of random variables too. And together with a probability of point nine five. They kept the true value. Of be the one between them. That's why we say that the confidence of the interval is point nine five. Here's an exercise for you. Read the information over here. You are asked to construct a point nine five conference into full forty intercept. Because iraq. And then. Without performing a t. test. You're asked to explain whether the knowledge of all the says that b. to zero is sixty. First is the alternative that it is not. Would be rejected. At the size of the test. Is five percent. The usual size. So please stop the clip now. Think about your answer and come back. When you are ready. Oh. Here's the answer. The lower and the upper bound. Start with the estimate for the intercept. Plus or minus to say multiple as before. Dimes to stand there. You can read. The estimate. And the standard error. From the output. So here you have the interval. Value sixty. Is not in the interval. It's actually to the left of the lower band of sixty five. So it will be rejected. Because only failures that are not rejected. Are in the interval. A little bit about. Estimation and prediction. You can imagine that the recent. Interest in the population mean of all carcasses. With respect to lean meat that have a certain fed that. Like a fed that of fifty meters. It's very easy to estimate this population mean. Because we simply plug in the value for x.. In the equation. That we derived. For the regression. This is the. Estimated intercept and minus zero point eight zero three five two. Is the estimated slope. So we end up with fifty six point three percent. That's the average. In the population. What he estimated the average of all carcasses would have fed they have to fifty millimeters. Now a related question is when i come up with a new carcass. And i only have the fed dept. And it happens to be fifty millimeters. What could the response why be. We want to predict. Why i had this to prediction. The prediction consists of two parts. An estimate for the systematic part of the model. Involving. Estimates for intercept and slope. And of course. Also we need to guess what the new epsilon for the congress might be. The first part. We already discussed this is just the new head that we talked about before. The fifty six point three percent. The epsilon. Is a problem. We don't know anything about it. We only know that all the excellence in the population together. Have mean zero. So our best guess for the new absalom. Is zero. And for that reason why had the prediction. Is the same as me you had the estimate. We actually predict. The value for the new caucus by the. Estimate of the average. Lean meat percentage of all carcasses. In the population that share that same value for fed that we can make a conference in the fall for the mean you as well. And here. It's convenient to use our. Our will give us the fifty six point three. That we calculated before. But it also gives us the standard bearer. And the lower. And the upper bound. Over here. They're calculated in the same way as before. The estimate. Plus or minus. The same multiple as before. Dives. The standard there. So that's the general form of the interval actually a little bit about prediction. Because it's important for the lean meat data. How accurate are the predictions. Well. We make two mistakes in y. head. The first one is the mistake. We make because we use. You head instead of new. That involves estimation error. In the intercept. And the slope. In a way that's easy. When we have time and money enough. We can take a very large sample size. And the larger the sample size. The smaller the estimation error. So the first mistake that we can make. Can be made as small as we like in principle. The second mistake. Is that we replace the epsilon by epsilon heads which is zero. So that's. State of size absolute. And the size of epsilon. Depends upon the size of sigma epsilon square or rather the square root of that. Sigma absalom. If that standard definition is lauch that mistake will be lauch we cannot make it smaller. With a lot your sample size because save lives long as a population parameter. It won't change because of the sample size. So if these mistakes you make with epsilon. Are too big because. Sigma epsilon is too big. There's nothing to it. But to look for an other x. variable. That is more closely connected to variable y.. So in summary. Confidence bounce. Are actually even the variables. They kept your to true value of a parameter between them. With a probability of point nine five. When the elf are the size of the test. Is point five the end of zero comprises all values that are not rejected by a t. test. And these are actually. All the values that. Match up with the data that are likely. On the basis of the data. The estimate for the mean. And a prediction for a response. Are actually the site. Yes the maisha never gets to zero when you increase sample size. But the prediction error does not. Thanks for your attention. See you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this enormous clip why we're explain. About the taste of that face in a mine as his with. Of course on the knife and proteins posies himself have no taste. But during processing suggest the fermentation are dosing of coffee or other posts s.-s. peptides and a minor s.s. are formed. That actually do have a taste. Examples of these products. Are found in and symmetric hydrolysis processes. For instance in. Infant formula. And science are used to hide that i suppose. But also information products suggest cheese and ham. Where the hydrolysis of. Both ends by lactic acid bacteria. Is one of the important. Starting points for the taste of header meant. In the product. In addition to the internet a catalyst as poster says there can also be a chemical had losses. Mostly using. Very strongly acidic conditions. And very high temperatures. Such as for instance for formation of fish feed from. Fish meal. And there are actually a lot of c. a man assets are formed. To understand the taste of the bad guys and. My message we will look to the. Interactions that take place. But first a very good example of. We find. Sweet tasting peptide. Is asked for farm after farm is known by many people it's used as the placement of sugar in the products. So we have the sweet days without the energy of the glucose. And in this case it's a di peptide for them but there is a group. On the cob of civic. Terminal and of the. Peptide. And this combination gives a very sweet taste of the molecule. So that is one of the reasons why people are interested in. The taste. Because we can replace. Glucose. If you have a sweet taste but also. There is a lot of interest to him place. Sold sodium chloride. To also get some how was salty taste or both the taste different. Peptides and the man s's have a different taste and this depends on how they interact with the taste receptors on the tongue. But this is set aside divided over the top in different areas. So we have sweet. Bitter salty and. Acidic taste. Mommy is betting we also regard it as a taste. But we focus mostly on these. The general structure of the sept or. On the taste but it looks like this. So that i see elements in the subs are. There is a location where we find a binding spot for potable accept or in this case the car books in the group. This can take or interact with supposed on. On the steps or. We have a total no nor the fia my no group. In a positive charge state. Can interact with total acceptor on the perceptor site. And in addition the rest of the. Because after which interacts with the site change residue of the a minor as it. And in this way. What is important is the distance. For instance between the. Posts on. Except for and quote on down or location on the molecule. On the taste molecule and also the. Polite it easy for instance of. And the size of the side as if you. If you look down to the different the mynah assets we can see that the taste. Can depend a lot on the seattle chemistry. So if you look to. Element as it's already a man as it's they have a different taste. And this is because they are still isomers and the sepsis rather binds who are actually still selective. So if you have a. Big a polar side group. That's a jew. We have a bitter taste for elemental assets. But we have a fetish suite a for d a minus it's. Knowing that. In natural products in postings mostly elemental as it's aqua. It means that the fear man as it stands would be better. All of smaller able goods. Then the difference becomes a little bit less clear. But still for element as it's. Some of them have a sweet taste. More have a neutral taste and that they are minor as are mostly neutral. If you look to the relation between the height of a busy city so the properties of the site changed as a jew we can see that it changes the taste. And actually. Here is a list of. Acidic a minor as it's a spark as it has it in which is a little bit more. Idol for big. Lucene more hydrophobic and tips of on the most wonderful become minor as it of this series. It can clearly see that in the l. for that it goes from neutral to bitter. And it's interesting to note that here bitterness is expressed as equivalents in cuffe in concentration. So that this i'd have them scope on that is used and in the deform. Most of the compounds are as. I have a sweet taste and then it is expressed in. Equivalent. sukkoth consultations. A minor as is are not the only compounds that have a taste. From. Because also the peptides are important. But that's a typically. Quite bitter. And there are several who also assume that they may not be exactly one hundred percent correct in every location. But as a whole of simple. A man as in a pet fight are more bitter than. In feed for a fee of mine as it's known terminal amana acids are more bitter than the terminal amana as it's and. Specifically the large. It's are not bitter. As i mentioned at the start of this knowledge eclipse. In tech code seems typically larger than tank you know dell times. Do not have a taste. So in normal protein isolates they should not be a taste. Birds as i mentioned during had losses we can develop taste. My question at the end of this knowledge clip is if you can describe how the taste of a protein. I don't listen to it changes. During the hydrolysis. So starting from a native posy. As a function of time and continuation of the i'd rather suppose as. What will happen to the taste. If you look to the had low doses process we start with very large high molecular weight. Proteins interposed genes. During i will assess the evidence molecular weight goes down because we get. Peptides formed. And as the power plants are formed at some point. They are also degraded to lower molecular weight and. In the beginning the interposing. Has no taste. The peptides are very bitter. And that the end the fed has small peptides and the fear mine as as have almost no taste. In summary. And if you look to the taste of proteins and peptides. This importantly lies of some but i have a very strong sweet taste. For instance aspart found. However that the bad guys can also be neutral or. In taste or actually larger five stand to be bitter. In addition. What you see is fear mine as is can be sweet or neutral or bitter.",

                "text": "Hello and welcome in this no less clip i will explain a few. poting analytical techniques. Protein and then this is very important for people who buy ingredients for industry. Also in that he sets of course it's important that you know which techniques you can use to analyze. Or quantify the proteins in the sample. And this is another fairly simple issue in this knowledge clip i will only focus on the most important question. The first. Most important question that people have. And this is how much both into i have and. What proteins so i have. So the basic techniques that we will look at is the question. How can i quantify the amount of protein that i have and. If i know how much. Which proteins are present. And this information for instance is useful in the labeling. If you look to food packaging that you have. There's always an amount of protein. They built on the product. The question is how do we know whether this value is coming from a very basic system and that list of proteins is to determine the content. The amount of proteins and this is what this use enabling. And the most basic approach. Is by dumont's or killed our methods. These are two different approaches but they do the same. And they determine the total nitrogen combs and. In foods. And because proteins. As compared to carbohydrates and from older compounds and gibbets are one of the few actually buy that has a lot of nitrogen. Typically most of the nitrogen can be related to poti. Do mussing killed are can be used for soluble as well this insoluble materials. In addition for soluble materials. Soluble proteins or solutions. We can use spector photometric essays. And we can do direct observation. Of the signal. That is coming from postings. As i will explain later or. In that act and. In the in direct measurements. We put the proteins in the solution. In addition we put a he agent. Di dio hate phonology agent or commodity agent. And these dyes form color to complex when in the presence of a protein and then the increase in color. Relates to an increase in potent course at station. But first let's look to the could. Total protein content by new mussing kell down. As mentioned or minor as is contained nitrogen. Sugars and carbohydrates to pick lead to not. So perfectly speaking we can use. Nitrogen content. In many foods made he says however. And also in a food labeling if you consider for instance a peach salva sausage. You cannot just dissolve it and put it in a spec of how to meter. So what we have developed. Many years ago. It's a message called kel tao and do mass. And they are total destruction. So we put a powder. And they killed our methods we put the powder or the product in concentrated so far as it. We boil it at c hundred fifty degrees so these are very extreme conditions and. The whole made this matrix is completely destroyed. Liberating the fi atoms of hydrogen. In the must we also have a total destruction of the system we burn. Without any s. it. So it's more safe to use for our people in the laboratory. That we burned us up at twelve hundred degrees celsius. Again we get a complete combustion of the sample. And the nitrogen is released as nitrogen gas. This nitrogen gas is then determined. Analyze and quantify it in different methods. And do. It's done by g.c.. And then we know how much nitrogen. Came out of the product so we know the amount of nitrogen per gram of that i matter. To know how much protein isn't in the products we need to to convert the gum of nitrogen. Per one hundred gram of the meth or two gram of protein and for this we use a coating conversion factor. This can be calculated based on the composition of the. poting and. A minor as it's and. If you looked a little. Literature. Almost everyone is using effect of six point two five. So it is in a way safe because many people do with but in most cases it is wrong. Because you can't calculate the cost factor for each man as it. And therefore also for exposing. To show with. What do we need to be needs to know which of mine assets we have the molecular weight of the amount as it so we know the gram of quality or mine as it. We know the amount of nitrogen molecules. We know that great molecular weight of nitrogen is fourteen dealt them. So we can calculate four go to instead consist for instance only of. Glutamine or glue to make acids. The corresponding nitrogen conversion factor. And if you can see here if i have a posting that whose only consists of truth of mine. By conversion factor would be five point four point five six five have only glutamate as it is nine point two. So this is to illustrate that the fact of six point two five. Is not always called that. It's a nice exercise to practice maybe for yourself. If you can leak out the later values that are shown in the table and if you can calculate. Similar values for proteins. It also shows that. To determine the correct. Nitrogen conversion factor we need to know the. A miner as head of the poty. Or the feet of material that you are using. Or the food material. But. In addition to the total destruction message. We can also look in the specs of how to meter for uble proteins or solutions of postings where we get different types of signals. The signals that this most used in the poting analysis by the specs of how to meter is based on the. Absorbance. At two hundred and eighty nano meters by the i don't get excited chain. Mind assets to perform for new i mean until you can see here the can you get the systems. That course. Told us at two hundred eighty nine a meet us. So if you measured a spectrum of these individual mine assets. You see here the. Absorbance first is the wave lengths and it is clear that there is a very strong. Absorbance in that area of the you feel spectrum. And the nice part about you feel spectroscopy is that the signal that we get the. Absorbance. Here. Absorbance at two hundred eighty nine to meet us. Is linear they lead correlated to the concentration and. To convert we only need to know the motor extinction goldfish and. Absalom. And the pass way. In the in the cell. Typically one centimeter. And amount of absorption coefficients of these mine as it's typically now. So if i know how many of these are mine as it's i have in my posting i can calculate. The motor exing should go fish out of my posting. And then determine that actually the concentration from the you feel sick now. Of course similar to the do must and they tell dow. If i have not one protein but. Different types of quoting present in the sample. It is bit more difficult to determine the mode to extinction of a chance of the mixture to compare. The two techniques. I found the gist of killed our total nitrogen content it's fast. It works with insoluble materials. Specter fota meet us. Maybe slightly cheaper. And also they are fairly fast. The disadvantages of the technique is in the mass and it determines. All night again. There were many people forget is that not all night vision comes from. Proteins and especially not from high molecular weight proteins. So we can have non-protein nitrogen from a man as it or small peptides. But also for instance from. Ammonium nitrate or order. Nitrogen containing compounds in the sample. For the specter of automatic. Essays. The biggest this fantasy is that we can only use all uble materials. And in addition. The signal in the u.v. can be influenced by nonpolluting compounds successful older compounds that also have ever mattick things. Then. Also we have determine the protein content. The question is which quality as a present. And a very basic technique to study the posing composition is. As the s.. Bait. As he has is a low molecular weights effect and. And what that this is if i add it to a podium solution. It binds to the outside of the peptide chain. If binds to the hydrophobic domains of the posy. The process. The negatively charged scoop. Of the s.e.'s has a very good interaction with the solvent. So it unfolds the poty. And in addition n.a.s.a.'s space what we do is we at d.t.d. the t. o. t. it's all of that from a cup to ethanol. Which is a reducing agent to big guys for five betas because some proteins are present as. Complex peptide chains. So in the as your space message. We dissociate. The coatings. We don't break the proteins but we dissociate so we have all the poli petty chains. Individually. In the solution. And then. We apply it on a probably a clue. Might gel. And then we apply an electric field. And depending on the size of the molecules. The molecules move. In the electoral for i think. Field. Large molecules. As you can imagine have more trouble passing through the medium so they are slow. The small molecules. Tend to be fast. And go further in the jail after a certain time. We also are always on s.s. speights a marker. Which is consistent of. Known podiums with a normal like the weight. So basically by putting the marcus' and the sample we can see that this poti has a molecular weight of twenty. Killadelphia. And this posing as a molecular weight of thirty killadelphia. In that way we can elevate the molecular weights and then if you know what type of sample you have. You can also identify the type of proteins. At the end of this. Not a split i have a question to test. If you have a clear distinction of the methods. And the applications. So if i have a way protein isolate which is a quite pure protein isolate. Of way. Way poaching concentrates slightly less pure some mocked i was present. And the soy protein concentrate. So from a different source. How would you distinguish these. Using the methods that are stored in this knowledge to claim. If you want to compare these three materials. You have to analyze what there's a difference. To isolate and of course the tate. Defer in the quantity of coding. So you need. poting constant. Determination. And the most easy one would be then. Killed all or do most to distinguish their way proteins from the things of course and need to look to the. Posting composition. Composition. Which molecules are present and for that i would use that as he has page. In somebody's protein analysis is very important. And there are some very basic techniques that are used. The most important distinction on the first level is the distinction between poting. Owns and. The amount of protein. And the composition. In addition we make a distinction between soluble and insoluble proteins. The techniques i shown are killed all and the mass for total poting specks of ultimately in direct and direct. In addition to as yet space for the political position. And you should realize that this is only the start of the techniques that are used. With sufficient for this in order to claim.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I'm going to talk about. The main guy mccoury actions that can take place in the pits. Here you see a picture of a french fries that are frighten oil. Not the frying of oriel it can also induce all kind of chemical reactions not only in the price themselves. But also in the frying oil. Going to talk about several. Reactions that can take place in fat. But actually there are two main reactions that can take place on lip it's. Oxidation reactions. Which can cost to. Oxidative friend city and. Hydrolysis reactions. That can result in two hundred live like. rancidity. Now both the two reactions can take place either gamma clee or anti metrically and they can take place. On room temperature. But also when you heat up an oil. These reactions can also take place. Now there are several other reactions. And also mainly. These two isomers station reactions. Pull the memories hasten reactions. Can take place when you heat up an oil. And there's not a clip. Mainly focusing on the. Oxidation reaction. Under under one hundred s.. Of the fat. I'm going to discuss first the oxidation reactions. We distinguish three types of oxidation reaction. Out of sedation. So talk sedation and. Oxidation caused by an unsightly. anti-magic oxidation the initiation of each of these three. Can be a little bit different. Without oxidation. It's very often caused by your free radicals. What happens is that the radical. Attacks. Next to the double bottom. So not. On the double bond. But next to it in a fatty acid. When you look at photo extradition. Then. It's light. That is the in the chief. Off this off sedation reaction. It sensitizes a sensitizer and then desensitize or. Will act on the double. So not next to the double bone but on the double bond. In a fatty acid. When we talk about anti medic oxidation than. This is caused by an enzyme this time is called not pictured uni's and this enzyme acts only. When we have a one for. Punted the in system. In effect the acid. Compound here you see death system. So it's a double single single double. System that you need forty enzymes sort at the end time can. Oxidize this part. Now this is only. In short the three main. Oxidation reactions that can take place in food. Now what is the effect of. Lipitor oxidation on the food. There are several effects. First of all of flavor and. Color components can get lost by oxidation. Mainly because d.s. flavor and color components have double bonds. And the oxidation. Takes place on the double bonds. Secondly. All kind of falsely first. Can be formed. And this is what we call. Oxidative. rancidity. Although sometimes these are flavors are. Wanted. So for example in addition of the cheese. Several compounds can be formed. Which are seen as a pleasant. Off flavor. And then the thirds. Effect of flippant oxidation could be a decrease of than fishel fell you off to slip it. I hear you see examples of. Butter or need to and that can get the rest. Rancid because of to dish and. Not to second guess mikkel reaction that is important and hydrolysis reaction. Not hydrolysis is always a reaction with water. And here you see an example of a triglyceride. That is hydrolyzed by adding three water molecules on each. Aster bond so each asked for bond here as hydrolyzed. And the result is one glycerol molecule. And three separate. Free fatty acids. Now this reaction this hydrolysis reaction can be caused by. Strong alkaline. Or strong. Acid conditions very often. Upon heating. But it can also be caused by an enzyme in this case the enzyme is called light pace. Not a result of the hydrolysis is. First of all. You can have a kind of smell or taste. Components. Caused by shorting. Chain fatty acids that are formed. So order than the fatty acids separate fatty acids are formed. When they have a short chain. Than they can be smelled or tasted. As a ranch it tastes. And this is what we call. Hundred little. rancidity. Now you can also get soapy taste wondered to change on longer than you might notice a soapy taste in the food product after. And also with silk. Tones could be formed because after all the lip it. Now here are two examples of hydrolysis that can take place in food. For example if you're deep frying snacks. Here you see the french fries that are deep fried. The price themselves the snacks often contain water. So when you are having a high temperature. You heat up the oil. To a high temperature. Then the reaction with the water of the snack. With the fat can start to take place and then a hydraulic system of the astor bond. So you can get a free fatty acids in the fat and glycerol this florus the p. h. of the fat. And that is often. Ashur to for example in kitchens. The measure p. p. h. of the frying fat to see if it's still. Defying fed is still in high quality. After hover single fruits you can also get hydrolysis. A good example is the lie pieces that are present in palm fruits. After. Harvesting the palm fruits the light places that are present in the cells of the palm food. Start to hydrolyzed the fats that are in the palm fruit. So to stop this hundred list station we have to. Heat shock. The palm fruit. To do nature. This and time. If we don't do that than in the palm fruit free fatty acids will be formed. Glycerol be formed and often a sharpie taste. Appears. So this lowers the quality of the palm fruit. Oriel. Not the effect. As i already said of. Hydrolysis. The formation of short chain fatty acids for example in butter. And this could get a rancid smell or taste. Not discussed to important reaction. Oxidation. And hydrolysis. Now i'm comparing here the fatty acid composition of for herring. Which is a fish which. All of. And i have a question to you. Why is it that the fish oil this herring oriel is more sensitive to oxidation. Than the all or for oil. Not the answer. Least that the fish oil has way more pulley unsaturated fatty acids. Than the all of oral has dipali unsaturated fatty acids even have. Like here to see twenty five. Has five. Double bonds. And here. I even have one with six double ones. I do more double bonds you have the more sensitive the fatty acid is to oxidation. Because these are present and. Relatively high among these fatty acids will be oxidized. Very easily. So to summarize. In this knowledge. I've talked about a few important chemical reactions that can take place in lip it's the main two are oxidation. And hydrolysis. The reaction. Taking place. Could be and i know some magic reaction. Or a gamma call reaction. And. Both can lead to. Desirable or. Undesirable. Properties and a food product.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I'm going to talk about a melting property so flip it i hear you see an example of chocolate and chocolate is famous for its melting properties when you put it in your mouth and it slowly starts to melt away. How does that work how does a solid fat. Which is crystal. Than. Liquifies into a liquid. I'm going to talk about that in this knowledge clip. Now first of all i need to explain you what a difference is between a liquid and. A solid fat. So here you see a sunflower oil. Which is a liquid at room temperature and there you see lard which is the solid fat. Room temperature. Now when it's a liquid it's none crystallized then when it's solid it's crystallized. If you compared it to if you compare sunflower oil at large for its composition in fact the us hits. Than you that it has a high percentage large high percentage off saturated fatty acids compared to some flour or oil which has a much smaller percentage of saturated fat as it's. And if you don't look up. Add to the amount of little lake acids. Here little league acid and due to oil. Then you see that lard has only a small amounts. And this is this has to double bonds linoleic acid. Supposedly unsaturated fatty acid and it has much more president as some flour oriel. Not the difference in the composition. Is a good explanation of the difference in its melting point. The reason that some flour or oil is liquid a trooper in future is related to the amount of pulley unsaturated fatty acids that and that is in there. At large is solid at room temperature because of the high amount of saturated fat the acid in their houses. How does that work. Now here you see what happens with a fad if you cool it down or heated up. Here is a warmth. That which is above its melting point. So it is. Interest no structure. And when you cool that down. Than slowly. A structure. In the molecules. Start to appear to molecules. These are fat molecules. Start to line up next to each other and we call that a crystal. And if i heat up this crystal again. It will lose its crystal structure. And it will become a liquid again. In which there is no clear crystal structure a precedent. Maybe go back you see that each molecule. Kill is to try glycerin it. And these triglycerides need to line up with each other. I hear you have a tri close right with only such a rated fatty acids. Here you have a try closer right twit. To unset or eat it's fatty acids in there. And here you have a try close right with more on chattery that fatty acid polian such treat it. So if i compared it to. Then hear the this saturday it is fatty acids have a street. Structure. Street. Long chains. And these trade chains can easily line up with each other so it can easily make a crystalline structure. Well if i look at this pulley and saturated fatty acid. And it has a band that structure. These fatty acids and because of that it's less easy for these triglycerides. To line up with each other so i need a much lower temperature to crystallise. This flip it. Compared to that lipitor. Which will already chrysolite as a higher temperature. Now during several properties of the lippitt that will influence its melting point. The first one is to. Or did the the length of the chain. If i look at the chain length and look at the melting point. Then i can clearly see that the longer to change. And the fatty acid. The higher the melting point of that lip it will be so. Small. Fat triglyceride with short change will have lower melting points than triglyceride. With long chains. It's because she's long change will make more interactions with each other than shorter chains. Second property that influence system melting point. Is the amount of double bombs. There. If you have no double bombs. And you compared then. This same fatty acids but then with one. Double bond in there. Then you see that the. Melting point. Dramatically drops. So that the more double bonds you have in the triglycerides. The lowered the melting point. Will be. This is because you need. You need to cool down to a very low temperature to make these. Triglyceride with a band of structure to make them crystallize with each other. Now. These were to do to dick cheney length. And the amount of double bond. The two very known properties. Of how it influences melting pointers the third important property. Of the fat. And i'm going to explain that with this graph. This is a graphic. I called up the solid fat content of the of the lippitt. So i increase the temperature and i look how much solid fat is present in the lippitt not at the low temperature. This is for cocoa butter. At a very low temperature let's say five degree celsius. About seventy five percent of the fat salt. And when i warm up. Then of course the solid fat decreases. And for cocoa butter. A round. Body temperature thirty seven degree celsius. Almost all the fat. Has melted and became liquid. That is why it liquefies. In your mouth. This is for the whole. Cocoa butter. But if i look at the fatty acids. That are present in cocoa butter. Then. It's had eighteen. Two eighteen one sixteen zero and. Eighteen zero. And if i look at the. Melting point. Of these pure. Fatty acids than eighteen zero has a melting point of seventy three. But when i'm. Heating up cocoa butter. At seventy degree celsius. It's already. Melted. For a very long time. It's already melted at thirty seven degrees celsius. Or in other words. It's not only to fatty acids that are in there but also how does fat the assets combine with each other and triglycerides. And also to try to strike competition. That influences the melting properties of the fat. So not only chain length. And the amount of double bonds but also the composition of the tri glycerin in the limpid influenced the melting properties. Now after explaining this. I hope you can answer this question. I have here. A few pure lippitt so. Imagine you have a pure lippitt. But only eight hundred two or a pure lip it would only eighteen general triglyceride or a pure lip it would only eighteen one triglycerides. Etc. What would then be. The melting points of these pure. Limpets. Now here are the answers. So maybe you remember dad. If you increase the amount of double bonds that this. Dramatically decrease. The melting point so this one with the most. Double bonds will have to lower melting point. And if you den has less. Double bombs. For example in one thousand one than. The melting point becomes higher again. And the higher the longer to change. Are still compared to fourteen zero sixteen zero zero. The hired of melting point will be. So to summarise. In this knowledge clip. I talked about the melting properties of. Facts. I talked about liquid. Which is none crystallized first which is crystallized. And then i talked about what influences to melting point and it's mainly the chain length of the fatty acid. The amount of double bombs present in the fatty acids. And then the composition of. Star glass writes. Themselves.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I'm going to discuss first philip pitts and some. Unseparated feibel compounds. I'm going to discuss these components because they have specific properties in the light lipped. For example here in this picture. You see the fruit of a pom pom fruit. And it is pretty red in this is because of one of the unsupported feibel compounds. In the palm fruit. Now let's first discuss again the difference between step on a fiber and step in a fight will all try to cook the sorites for example are supposed to feibel they haven't asked for bond so i can supply the fighter bond. The other molecules here are untapped in a fireball they don't have an ass to bond. I'm going to discuss these components here the forceful limpets and then a few of the inception of fiber components. So let's start with a forceful it's first philip it's a curve for example in several fractional oils. And the importance of a forceful lip it. Is that it has a force for a cast group. You see the group. Appear. And then it has two. Fatty acids wrested use. On it instead of three like it's with the tri killed this rules. Now the difference would a normal tri killed this role as a force for rick. The phosphoric acid group is. Hydrophilic. So it is a surface active substance because it has a head reflect part. The so for rick as with group. And the hydrophobic part due to. Fatty acid chains. Because of this. Surface. Active property. It can be used in several product. For example this husan chocolate. Or in mayonnaise in an ice cream. Not want to show you an example of meanies. Here i haven't me any s. and if i look at the ingredients list of mayonnaise i see that it contains a lot of oil. And it contains from water and vinegar. And also some. Now. It is done. Make sure old. Oil and water you could see oil and vinegar. So let's see what happens if i mix or lin vinegar. Here i have some oil. And then i add a little bit of vinegar. Just like in i'm a nice. So let's see if i mixed it to whether i could make him a nice mix by shaking. Let's look at the product that we made. You see that the. Make sure it's knowledge. It's. It's not clear anymore i cannot see through. What i also notice is that it's not really stable. It might take a little bit. But if you look at the product then i see that the oil droplets are merging with each other and if i wait long enough done i will see that the oil. Will float on top of the finger and. You probably know already that. Oil and water don't mix also oil and vinegar don't mix. So you can. Wonder yourself. How did they do that in to me a nice if you look at the ingredients list. It also set x. or accurate and that is one of the ingredients that make sure that the oil. And the water or the fin and they mix with each other i hear no you clearly see that there is an oil leak or on top of defending earlier. So it separated. Out how did they do that in the me a nice. It's the first full lippitt study at two to me in a soda ingredients of the main is our oil that and some ak or ak yorks some vinegar or and water. And then often there are sold in sugar or other components for taste. Not if you mix the oil and the vinegar. I do that here you see the oil droplets the yellow droplets. Mixed with the blue dye the divan. Water part. After some time. They separate. Too. But aggy if you add the akyol. The ag contains less attend class atin is a complex. Group of limpid components. And one of the important limpets component the last with an as a forceful it. And this forceful lip it is. Surface active. Meaning that it will act on the surface of each or droplets so it will round. Each all droplet. And by surrounding it all droplets. Profound. Oil droplets from merging with each other so to supper ration of the oil and the vinegar will now not take place. So the last of ten acts as an e. mails of fire. It's the forceful lip it's in there that. You may also face. The main. Not that was about first philip. Now let's talk about some other lip and components the unsupplied of fiber component. So again. And suppose a fiber component is a component that has no aster bond. Many of these components out of present limits give specific properties to deliberate. For example gives color to the lippitt. It can have an oxygen property and it. Very often also have a biological function. But i'm going to discuss. Three unsupportive feibel compounds. Sterols. Karata noise and to talk of fields. So that start with just a rolls. That is sterile. Also called. Steroid alcohol. Are the repetition of steroids. They have a clear biological function. And they can be asked. Certify to a fatty acid. Done it's still done it as has happened a fiber compound. But in this case here. It's a sterile and. There's zero it group is not free so it's not just step on a fiber compound but an unstoppable fiber compound. Now. Occur in plans. We call them fight just they're also a good example of bad toast to just roll. And here you see the picture of the beta sitosterol and animals. Most of this there also are you also have that in your body. And here is the example of cholesterol you see dr the molecules are very like very comparable with each other. So i doubt about steroids. Not. The next one stop in a fight will compound is corrupt to know it's a crutch annoyance are a known for giving for example color. To fat. It's an unstoppable flyable compound. And for example it's present in palm oil palm oil has a red color. And this red color comes from a better carotene that is present in the palm oil. The betacarotene. Has a long clean you gated system. Now how do you recognize it can you get it system. A can you get it system is a double single double single l. terminating. Fashion so its ultimatum double single double. And if it has seven. Double bonds in a row then it's long enough to give color to a compound. Not in this case it has. I think. Over eleven. Can you gauge its. Bombs. So it gives a lot of color. And in this case a rat color. Also because of this long you can you get it system it's also an antioxidant and. Because it is only a carbon and hydrogen chain. It is also a very solid will and limpid and. In an organic solvents. Not the next. One step in a fiber compound as took a few rolls. Also known as. One of the took a few rolls as vitamin e.. It's universally spread in many fat fat lip bits. And you have different kind of took a few rolls. Depending on the substitution on the molecule. The general structure is. To ring structures. Of which one is a benzene within or each group. Connected to it. And then there is a long chain on the r.. And depending whether it has or has not a double bunks it's either a took a fear or. A took a trial. Now what you see here so it's the benzene ring with the age group. And that makes that this molecule is an anti oxidant. That's for example president and palm oil. Palm oil contains about six hundred two thousand parts per million. Took a few rolls. And the four main types are these four different ones. So tikrit took a few rolls and trying also and. It serves as an antioxidant. In the palm oil. So i came to the end of this knowledge clip and i have a question to you. If you look at the structure of fish tocopherol. Can you tell me rather discuss. Molecule as an anti-oxidant. And could you tell me whether took a few rolls gift color. To a lip at yes or no. So the answer to that question is that no it doesn't have any color property. And you can see that by looking at the size of the coin you gated system. And this case i only have here. Three gated bonds. Meaning that this can you get it system is too small to get any color. Is it an intoxicant. Yes. Of course i already told it. But you can also see it from the structure. This benzene ring would an age group. Makes that this molecule has anti-oxidant property. So to summarize. In this knowledge clip. I've discussed. A few important molecules that are present in lipitor i've discussed a forceful lip that's. That it can be surface active and. Can make sure that you're me in a state stable and then i've talked about a few unsupported feibel compounds that give color or have an toxin and properties or biological functions for deliberate.",

                "text": "Welcome in this enormously but i will explain about the chemical the excess the chemical or on proteins. Chemical reactions kernel on potent. Doing poses saying. Well for instance heat treatment has a lot of effect. But also sometimes. One thought processes such as protein hydrolysis. Is used to degrade. Proteins for. Nutritional purposes or to decrease and it's in this city. As a result of heat leaman we can have formation of the new all that if it is. Basically these resulting cause thinking and loss of the i guess ability. Reshuffling. And formation of the eyes of his. D.m. addition or decoupled salacious. So if i loosen my nickel for a couple of citigroup and. My yacht he accepts. I'm a yacht he acts as a fairly well known and illustrations of the effects of these pows s.s. are shown in the picture. Coffee roasting. For instance. All the flavors are for the last part due to my r.d. accents. Also the color of the brown color and. Smell and taste of. Brown that. Ordered the cost of that bakes that is due to does the actions. Typically these are not elevated temperatures quite high temperatures. And most of the reactions or go faster at extreme ph so very high ph. Eight nine ten. Or very low ph one to see what this effect of these reactions. Well. There can be different types of consequences the most important. Of nutritional perspective. Is that we lose essential or minor acids because they are. Degraded. We can have course making of proteins as mentioned this lethals in the loss of digestibility. Again loss of nutritional value. But it can also lead to loss. In so you've been. Changes in texture. Also changes in. Functional properties such as foam and the mill simple pity's change in an agenda. Potential. Especially upon hydrolysis for instance. The formation of omar compounds and or flavors is very important because of this new term and. For many products g.'s have coffee etc. The taste. And the quality of the products. And what we sometimes forget. He's a lot of these chemical he acts as if they are on charges of mine as it is that we came to the charge of the mine as it is and thereby the chance of the podium. To start with. I will discus hydrolysis of proteins. There are different types of find all nurses we can do and some method kind of alyssa's. Birds. For a man as is the nemesis we have a fair to storm. Condition six mo to huddle close it as it and. Boiling at one hundred degrees celsius for twenty four hours so this is a very extreme condition. But under those conditions. The peptide bones. In the posing are high the mice and what we have is the release of fee a minor as its. But of course during milder conditions. Not six lb of the lower concentrations of as it. And different times of heat and we still have some little assess. And as mentioned we can have. And some other kind of offices secondly the action is moth or gurps during. Heating is the formation of the heel of a new thus a juice that in the energy cells in these you know of the needle that if it is from asia. And the first step of this reaction can take place on different the mind as its. Seen a system you know. Nina. And the side go bless the jews. Because they are partly active. Going to the act under different conditions and splitting off the hydroxyl group. Splitting off the silverado group. The thing of hydrogen is built in the formation of the heat of the new. And this compounds you can see here the double boned is still he active. Because of the presence of the double bond. And then the second step of the reaction. These. They have all of the new compounds that we formed can react with other a minor as hips. And depending on the side lissa do. We get different products. So there can be a reaction to liason then we get the heel of the new. Formation. The scene of the nina. Only toe on an inner or lancy only know what is important in those reactions is to realize that this a man as it is can still be part of opposing. Chain. Of a prototype chain. So what we can have here is the coarsening thing of different parts of own poting or different proteins that are course linked together by a covalent bond. That cannot be degraded by enzymes. So if you did. Digest. These proteins. These cause things will prevent further digestion of the. Of the types. In addition we have larger coatings. We can. That aggregation. And thereby also loss of your ability with cells also negative. For the digestibility. If you look to real life situations. This is an example of. The formation of least you know. The need. In the. Voiding of an ak. You can see here that the contents of this compound is increasing significantly. Even when you heat an act which is one hundred degrees of course. There's a relatively at a neutral ph. And it is important to know that this compound leashing are the mean. And also the only two i mean and none to nina. Have been used in the process indicators of the heat processing of food. In addition to these reactions. We have the deisel five blitzes which can form. And be broken. And they can shuffle. And this is called. Oxidation all the diction of those fights bridges. So the diction of it is from the. Fee for to the as aids to the fees for final form. Otherwise if i have to two feet still find little groups. They can form together. And or sedation to form a coursing and discourse things are normally present. Inside of the pose in to stabilize of structure. The joy in processing they can become available and we can also have the shifting of the eyes of god but it has its looks like this. So i have a deisel felt that we see in different parts of protein one. Also have different vibe it has with in poti two and during that election heating or. At ninety eight for instance. I can have a shifting so posting one is causing this protein too. And vice versa. A consequence of this is again that i have a post linking between proteins. This leads to aggregation. And consequently losses for you billet he and it can also change. The texture. And last example is that. If i have a feast of ideal. Are you all this can be costly and cheerful. Existing deisel five dates for instance here. So this is a last example of shifting. And all these reactions can occur. More or less imitating asli an all or chemical reaction that orchis quite a lot is the simulation and the emanation. These reactions are based on the group that is leaving the puppet of the mind i said so in the decouple salacious i did lease couple actually. Carbon dioxide. I loose my cup of said it as it grew up. The consequence of this of course is that if i loose a couple said it as it. I lose a charge. Negatives out. On the posing. In addition i can have. The emanation. Where i loose. The fee among the group by the lease. Of a man. To the to the media. This. Typically is the reaction course by. Michael by all spoilers for enzymes present in my close. Result in the formation of these compounds. Basically it's very bad because it can cause. Of flavors and. It's a declaration of your product. A combination of the elation and the emanation is called. The stack of degradation. And this. These holes in the formation of. L. the hides. The reaction schema shown here's how i have my basic model s. it have a dick of a new group that can attack. And then basically a split of carbon dioxide. And i split of the group. And then in the end. I did lisa here on the top corner. My elbow height and it is important to realize that all the highs are quietly active. And then the addition they tend to be quite full of tile. So this is often the source of. The formation of flavors. And also subsequently axioms that dictates the polity of the products. Examples of the products that are formed during microbial spotted by decouple chelation and the emanation are listed here so called of in the m.p. to siena are the breakdown products of lice and on the tina. You may mention from the names of added that these compounds spell very terrible. Yet this is the corpse. Smell of death animals. In addition. It will be too i mena and i mean a bit erratic as it very well known because they are also very followed tile. And they have a very strong smell that this not appreciated by customers so is this related to them say that of products. Another example is histidine. Because if it is over rated by dicko books elation you get hissed histamine and histamine as you may know is related to allergic responses. So the. Persons of histamine in a food product when you ingest may lead to a false or. Pseudo allergic reaction. And this is very dangerous. So that is why actually these reactions are quite relevant. At the end of this enormous clip. I have a question for you to describe to advantages and to this of competence. Of heating. Of food products at fountain chisel feeding of food products are of course. An increased. Flavor formation so in many cases this can be controlled and then we have a positive influence on taste. We can have an improved. Texture. During the bonding of an akc aggregation and i still find it from asia. That this it found that yours however is if it goes to find that we lose the essential amino acids. Especially. Lies in which can react in a my yardy action. In. And in addition to other new formation. And other reactions. And lastly. We have possible. Course linking decimalization. And these result in the loss of the i guess ability and the loss of nutritional value. So to summarize. Chemical reactions or grr often if it is very important to realize. They change the quality of the proteins and. It depends on the temperature. Consequently it can result in these riots. Or indeed side changes in the food products.",

                "text": "Welcome to his first clip on multiple regression. First i want to show you where we are on the map. He see the map. About multiple regression so we are here in the beginning. And we will discuss the model and estimation in his first clip. And many topics will follow like. Topics about the elephant table the t. tests. Asquith simpson squares etc that. These will be handled in next clips. The example that we will look at here in this first clip is an example about the weight loss of some chemical compound. Why. And we look at the weight loss due to. Aerial. Exposure and relative humidity. So here today they are shown there are twelve observations. Twelve. Experimental units known faerber y. represents the weight loss of the. Of the compound measured in grams x. one is the exposure time to air which is an experimental factor with. Four levels levels four five six and seven. And x. two is the relative humidity. During exposure which is an observed variable. And the question is is the response why related to requests is x. one. And or x. two. First little bit about the terminology. And why it's called a response but we could also call it the dependent variable by variable or the requests and. And the x j c and we suppose. I suppose that we have k. of them. But we have to call to requests is sometimes they are called independent variables x. variables or. What was it. Explanatory variables. If we're interested in relationships you could make scatterplots. So here we see bad guys cut the plots. Of weight loss first as exposure time weight loss for several the few minutes he also exposure time physical. Humidity. And together they form a scatterplot matrix. And this moment we only focus on two of the little. Subplots. So here to plot the weight loss first is exposure time. And we may see a positive relationship here. Of y. with x. y. and in this plot. We see possibly a negative relationship of y. with x. two. With relative humidity. But the question that we have is. What is the simultaneous relationship. Ship between y. and x. one and next two. For that we have to go through a three dimensional sketch the plots. So here you see such a plot. With the relative humidity on this axis exposure time and axis. And weight loss on the third axis. And the points are shown here. In three d. and. Instead of finding a single best line like we did in simple regression. Now we want to find the best fitting. Plane. And here. This. Best fitting plane is shown. To estimate this plane. And we have to do with testifies that this local model. And this is the school model for the data that we have fair. Looks like this. And we start with why the observed weight loss for an individual experimental unit. And we ride y. as a sum of two components of a systematic part in a random part. And the systematic part. Actually to be does erupt as be the one x. one plus b. to two x. two. You see that the beat us are combined linearly. And together they form. The population mean for the weight loss. With exposure time x. one. Develop the humidity x. two. And the venom part. Tells you about the departure of an individual weight loss. From this me. This is similar to simple in your expression. But now we have multiple requests and if what is called multiple regression. The venda part of the model. For the record part of the model we have a number of assumptions and they are exactly the same as in simple. Repression. So we assume that those epsilons are differences but expected to mean. And therefore they should ferry around zero. Those epsilons have ferrie and sigma square epsilon. Which is supposed to be constant. And the absolutes are normally distributed. And here you see a plot of such a normal distribution around zero with standard deviation. Sigma absolute on. Telling you which fell use. Are likely. And which are not. Furthermore we are sure that those absolutes are independent and correlated. So that's all the same as what we add in. In simple repression. There is a difference between simple and multiple regression especially with respect to the into potations. Of slopes in simple reversion to beat a one is the expected change in y. for a unit change in x. one. But the multiple regression this becomes the expected change your why for a unit change in x. one. While keeping all the other regress as constant. If you change checked one then the other axis should not change as well. They should remain constant. In this example that would mean that b. to one is the expected change in weight loss. For one extra hour of exposure. While keeping relative humidity at a constant value. Now you may think yourself about what interpretation of the intercept is and go back to the. Simple regression. If you need that information. How do we get the estimates of the parameters well we usually squares like we did this simple request. Now we have to find three parameters b. to zero b. did one beat or two. Such that the sum of squares of the said utils is the smallest possible. Well recall what he said your lists. Every city will. The research will be archived for a position i is the difference between you observed why. And the predicted. Why. Why i am minus why i had. He had to indicates. The prediction. So did. Why i had to be to zero had to be the one had x. one. Would be the two had x. two. And we tried to find those b. to fell use for which the sum of the squares of those we said you'll see is as small as possible. The research you will see. In this graph are the small distances that you see here defer tical distances between this point. And the point on the plane. And you could look upon it as a realization of the aether. Mathematically here we have a minimisation problem. And really you remember from high school that you could solve such a problem by taking. Derivatives. So by differentiating the ever sums risk with respect. With respect to every question coefficients. And that would lead you to a system of linear equations which are called the normal equations and. The software. Why car. Is solving systems. Of linear equations like b.s.. Ok so we know now how to get estimates for the for the the b. to parameters but how do you would get the estimate of the. Of the ferry in sequence. Well if we do it in the same way as we did in simple of a question if you would know the epsilons. The estimate of the ferentz would simply be. The f. rich. Of the squared. Everest's. But of course we don't know these. Ever terms. So instead. We used to reschedule z.. And. Well if we do so we should not be five by twelve. Because we estimated. Inbetween three parameters. So three degrees of freedom will last. So leaving twelve minus three. It's nine degrees of freedom to. To estimate to ferry and so in the end the estimate. Of that he said will fair ians is the sum of the squares of that he said you will shown here. Defied by. One city. In the general case. The estimate of the city will ferry insists the sum of the square is the airbus. The residual the fight of by and minus capers one where we have k. every christmas. And we need to add this one because there's also an intercept evolved. So we find here. The formula. Sigma square epsilon. Is easy and. Some of the squares with the errors. If i did my and minus k. plus one. Ok this term is called m s e. The mean square forever. If we fit. Such a model with our. We get output it looks like this. So in this part. We see the least question estimates for the intercept. And for the slope. For x. one. And a negative slope before. X. two. And we find that estimate for the central standard deviation up for the fair means for the standard deviation to get a fair means we have to square this number. So it would yield. Point three zero one. And we also find here. The research of the piece of feedom twelve minus thirty sequel to nine. In summary. So the multiple regression model for the i think spring mental unit looks like this. While i is b. to zero up a b. to one x. one i put b. the two x. two i plus. Well as many terms as we need. Up until the case one be to k x k i. Plus the ever term epsilon i.i. the model some shows that we have. Follows for this the systematic. Blue part of the mean of y. can be written in this way. And for the of n. the bard epsilon i. We assure him that we have a normal distribution. Constant fairy and superscripts alone. And independence. The parameters to be s.. The made that of the day the r k plus one question coefficients. Namely the intercept. And the slopes. But also we have an error of fermions parameter sequence where absalom which need to be estimated. The slopes are now. Partial coefficients they put represent changes in the expected y. for a unit change in x l x j. While keeping all the other requests as constant. The repression coefficients are estimated using least ques as we did the simple regression and the araf ariens. Is estimated using. Mean square forever. m.s.e.e.. With and minus capers one degrees of freedom. Thanks for your attention this you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "A main question in epidemiology is what causes disease. When we talk about a study on the causes of the seas we talk about. And the standing the etiology of the disease. On one hand we have exposures. Determinants. Agents or with vectors. And we want to know where the disease could influence. Outcomes. Diseases. Illnesses. Or maybe some health indicators in statistics. These two arms are also called. Independent variables. And dependent variables. A causal for these. Mostly is not a single calls. This is a conceptual scheme. For the causes of disease. Taken form the form wasn't. He you can see that there can be three sets of course are all leading to the same disease. Every set of courses. Consist of separate components causes. A cost. Is not a single thing. It's a combination of events. Conditions. Or correct mistakes the plain essential imports using the disease. A component of course is one factor in the total set of courses. That contributes to watch disease causation. But it cannot do it on its own in necessary cause is also one component of course. But one. That is required for the development of the disease. The combination of causes that eventually produces the zs is called the sufficient cause to illustrate. When you look at these different sets of courses. You can see that. Each of these letters a b. c. d. e.. And so on is a component of course. Each of the sets. Has the letter. A which means that eight is necessary for producing the disease and. Each of these different combinations. Is called called a sufficient cause. Of course there's an important will. Of time. A component of course. Is part of a cause or action or causal chain. And throughout time. These. Change develop. In the end. Causing these east's a cause can be positive. When the president of the exposure. Or deal with factor. Is causing more disease. Or cost can be negative. And that means that the whisk factor or the exposure. Prevents against the disease. A major feature of course. Is that it's always preceding. Disease. Occurrence. But the time. Order of these different components causes. Is difficult to assess. Maybe you now understand that most diseases don't have single causes. It may look like for example cystic fibrosis is caused by single gene mutation. But that are also other factors that need to be questioned to cost a disease. Some other diseases may be only due to environmental exposure. Like as best as exposure and lung cancer but also there. The may be other factors involved too. Eventually cost of easy's most diseases. Especially quantic diseases are multi causal they. Result from gene in fine went into action. And an example is given here. For breast cancer. So when they so we lay ssion or causal. Is this a pool of global warning that over time. The types of. Underwear changes. Of course not an hour explain why. In epidemiology. We often observed. S. associations. We don't know whether the exposure. Really cost. The disease. We find that the both are related. As i said before. It's only call so when the determinant. Preceded the seas in time. But it could also happen that the determinant is a consequence of the disease. Or it could just be there. As a result of some other in the line process. Without causing the disease. So called. Innocent bystander. We know that it's called so when we we moved to determine and or the exposure because then did the occurrence will change. And it's of course important for prevention. To know whether something is causally related. Because the prevention. We want to we move to whisk vector. And we want to change the occurrence of to disease. The cost must always preceded the effect it's an absolute requirement for being of course. But then that condemn your maci. Especially when we measure with fact and. Disease at the same point in time. We don't know exactly what came first. Was it the exposure. Or did the z's. For example. When we measure body weight. And at the same time. We let people fill in a question l. physical activity. And we find some s. association between the two. Is the body weight then the consequential fish are quick to fatigue or physical activity the determinant of body weight in these people that's sometimes hard to find out. When we find that a quick factor is actually a cause of the disease we talk about that we first causation. So dan we find an association that you know on direction. Instead of with factors causing the d.c.s. to disease. Is to is the determinant of to waste factor. We want to avoid that by choosing the right. Epidemiology course study design. Which you will learn about later. So now you should know what it yalit she is that a course could consist of many components. Some of which are necessary. While others are not. And that not all. Associations are truly causal.",

                "text": "In epidemiology. There are two main types of we should. One hand we have to descriptive epidemiology. On the other hand we have the analytical epidemiology in descriptive epidemiology we are interested in the amount. The frequency of disease or other conditions in certain people. At a certain time. Or at a given place. So we ask ourselves. Questions like what happened who got to disease. When did it happen. And where did it happen in. Analytical epidemiology we go one step further. We want to know why the people got the sheraton you see so we're interested in the etiology of the disease. Or the causes of the d.c.s.. We now focus in this clip. On the descriptive. Epidemiology a descriptive study. Is no more than just taking a snapshot of a certain population. You can collect all kinds of data and a population like the factors. The presence or the prevalence of the disease. The presence of risk factors behavior. And so on. It's important to take a we put tentative sample of the population. Otherwise you won't describe the population well. Why do we need these descriptive data. Well it's important because for public health policy. We want to know how behaviors. Are present in our population. Which diseases are present. Which we expect that our present. We may study. Find trends or specific populations ship kooks like those with a lower socioeconomic status or children. And we want to have a basis for. Planning and be a fairly ration of. Community interventions. And descriptive data can also be interesting for further analytical studies. This is an example of a descriptive study here we. Asked boys and girls. To fill in the questionnaire on the physical activity behavior. And here you can see the results for different age groups. You can see the pattern of physical activities in boyce. And in girls. And we can put some public health policy on this. This is an example of another descriptive study. Here you can see mortality rates in the question of federation. These mortality rates are just registered at the health statistics. In that specific country. So we have these data where the weatherley available. And what you see here. Is there's a peak in mortality. At the sheraton time periods. And it may ways in hypothesis. Why did this. Peak. Occur. And could we find out something about the cause of mortality in that specific time periods. So now you have learnt about descriptive epidemiology. And later on in this course we will go deeper into the analytical epidemiology.",

Case reports or case share base preference thirty's also called surveys and studies based on hells which is twee or other one thousand li collected data in a case we poured a deed to a detailed description is given by the medical doctor. On the symptoms diagnosis tweets meant. And swarm of. Individual patients. It's important for the early identification of health problems. For example. If x. is diseases. That certainly occur. In the population. It may also generate hypothesis about potential causes of the disease. In a case we port. Description of one patient is given an indication at least a description of more patients is given. In a prevalent study. The presence of a condition at a particular point in time. Called point prevalent. Or appear we are to court the period. Prevalent is described in the defined population. You may for example describe the total number of people with a short in the cease. And in the picture you can see their prevalence of multiple sclerosis. In the world. And those countries. Indicated by the way it has the highest prevalence of the disease. You may also describe the distribution of risk factors like smoking. Blood pressure obesity. All other characteristics for example seatbelt use. The prevalence. Is influenced by the incidence of the deceased. The disease duration and also. Other factors. For example. How likely is it that the disease is identified. Why is a preference study important. Well it's mainly important. For politicians. They want to know the burden off of these least in a population. And to assess the need for health services. It's also interesting to compare the prevalence of disease across populations or to examine. Time twenty indices performance or disability. Of the disease. Where you do a prevalent study. It's important to take a we presented to sample. For example. If you want to assess the many body weight of the entire global population. Who should not just to lex some people. But make sure that you take the we put entity. Sample of the entire world population. Based or weighted on the site of these countries. So don't do it like this where you. Over. Emphasize for example the u.s. population. But do it like this that you weigh. Dense populations. More heavily than populations. With less inhabitants. Here is an example of a large. Nationwide survey. Called t.. And haines. Which is a survey to measure the health and waist factors. Of all americans. Of course they don't measure. All americans. But they take the we please entity of sample. Another type of descriptive studies. Can be based on health which is twenty's or. Routinely collected data. For example. What tell it where quotes or spittal ization records. It can be based on records. At the g.p. office. But also. Child care data. Or infectious disease morning talking. Be careful because when you use data that are within the collective the state are often codes. And the coding may change over time. Where you have a different. Cold for the disease. You may also get a different. Prevalence of the disease. Which is not a wheel change but it has to do with. Way the disease is classified. I end up with one question for you to think about. Nowadays. What people suffer from the condition called. Attention deficient. Hyperactivity disorder. Eighty eight. Does it weigh flecked a to increase in the prevalence of the disease. Or does it have to do. Maybe. With the way the disease it die is diagnosed. So in this knowledge clip. You learned about different types of descriptive. Epidemiology.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. You will learn about different survey designs that are used in analytical epidemiology. You first heard about descriptive epidemiology. There we studied if we can see an amount of disease or other characteristics in the specific population. We are mainly interested in persons time and place in. Analytical epidemiology we are interested in the course of disease. We want to study the. Etiology of the disease. We ask ourself the same question as in descriptive epidemiology but we want to know also. Why did these these are correct in these people in this place. At this moment in time. Now we will move on to discuss several studies chinese that are used in epic. Analytical epidemiology. On one hand. We have observational study these sites. And these can be divided equal sectional studies. colwich studies and case control studies. On the other hand we have expert in mental study designs. And the main one is the way in the mice controlled trial. Course sectional studies. Part of the observational study the science. We have a given population for example. A population based survey. In that survey we measure. All kind of things. We also measure all kind of. Exposures and we measure all kind of diseases. You can then divide the population in those who are exposed to a certain factor of interest. And in those who do have a disease that you're interested in. For example. We can t. fight. Smokers. First as nonsmokers. And within the smokers we can define. People who have lung cancer. And those who don't have lung cancer. We do the same. In those who don't smoke. Now you can make a two by two table. To see where the smoking. Is associated with the presence of lung cancer. This is another example of course sectional study. Here we have descriptive data. In boys and girls. On the frequency or physical activity. At different ages. When we ask these people how much they exercise. We can at the same time measured of body weight. And for example give them a questionnaire on their dietary habits. We can then study. Whether. For example body weight. Is related to their dietary habits or body weight related to the fish quick to fit the pattern. Or maybe physical activity related to their dietary habits. So we can make associations between all these factors that we measured at the same moment in time. A cool watch that he is different because in a cold study. Time plays an important role. We start with a sort of population. We divide the population in those exposed to certain factor. And those mother exposed. And we followed these people in time for the occurrence of disease. For example we can defined. Defied a population we spoke with and nonsmokers. We can follow them for ten twenty or thirty years. And see who will be philip lung cancer. And who won't be philip lung cancer. We can then compare the incidence of lung cancer in the exposed. With the incidence of lung cancer in the middle next post. And then we can study the association between smoking in the weights. Of lung cancer. A case control study. Works the other way a wound. Here we start with the disease. For example we have people who have lung cancer. And. People who don't have lung cancer. And we study. Whether they smoked. Or did not smoke. In the past. We can do that by asking. These people. Or we could provide a questionnaire. But the main thing is that we go back in time and. Ask about past exposure. So now you know about sui different types of. Observational study designs. We have to cohort study. That goes forward in time. We have to case control study. That starts with the disease or the outcome. And goes backwards in time. And we have to call sectional study. That measure exposure in the z.'s. At the same moment in time. Then we have to experimental study the sign. Also called when the much control trial. Or sometimes the clinical trial. Here we start again with the population. But he had the main difference with the ct study. Is that the investigator. Assigns the exposure. So by when the medication. Investigated he cites. Who will get to basic fact or the exposure order treatment or shouldn't work. And who does not get it. Then again we follow them for what in time. To she who will develop the disease. And who won't get to disease. So the main difference between the when the much control twi you and the prospective cold study. Is that the investigator. Signs the exposure. So now you know the difference between descriptive and analytical epidemiology. Different types of to facial studies. To call sectional study. The case control study and cold study. And you should know by now. What or when the mice control. Twi always.",

                "text": "Welcome. At this clip. About measures of the seas occurrence or frequency measures and. Now i would like to explain the relation between an instance. And a preference. You could think of a bucket full of water in this case and. Think about the prevalence as. The total amount of water which is in this bucket. And then. Think of the fact that the duration of a certain disease. Will make your prevalence. Higher or lower. So. Also depending on your. Incidence of the disease so the incidence to makes the number of new cases within a population. Or the water drops within its. Bucket. But also. There are people getting out of your cohort so there are people dying they're cured or. Lost to follow up. So you're dropping water in this case. So the prevalence. Is depending on the number of new cases in your study. As well as the duration of the disease. So for example. Think about the. Instance which may be low. But you duration of your disease because everybody. Is not. People are not cured. They're not lost to follow up so the duration of the disease is very long. Your instance is. Small as compared to your. Prevalence. Or your prevalence large as compared to instance if your prevalence is low because of the short duration of the disease. Your prevalence will be small. As compared to the. Instance so if for instance if you have a cold. Which is cured fairly fast but there are a lot of people who catch that cold. Your influence. Is high as compared to your. Prevalence within a population. Now. These are the estimated number of new cancer cases the instance. And as well as the prevalence of cancer. In two thousand and two. So the prevalence are the green bars and the incidents. Are the are the yellow bars. Now just as an example look at the first one. This is breast cancer. You see that the prevalence. The green bar. Is very large as compared to the incidents. Now think what would that mean. This means that your. Prevalence the duration of the disease is low. Which also means that people are not dying from breast cancer. They still are living with breast cancer. Although sixty percent or more in the world is cured. Of breast cancer. But the incidence remains. Small as compared to the breath. Prevalence because there are a lot of women in the world. Living with breast cancer they don't die from it. When you compare that to lung cancer for instance. You see here that the prevalence and the incident. Incidents are almost the same. Now what does that mean. It means that people do not live long. We have lung cancer. There they are diagnosed. And then they are treated. But oftentimes people are dying at an early stage. So this means that people are not living long with that disease duration of diseases not. Long sort of prevalence and the incidents. Are almost equal in this case. So when they use in incidents and when would you use prevalence you know we use an instance. Usually when we're talking about an accurately a quiet disease. So another disease which exist for a very long time. We are interested in the new cases. And we usually think. About. Instance when we want to know the etiology of certain. Disease when we want to learn about the risk factors of a certain disease. We're thinking about those who develop the disease within a specific point of time so the new cases are interested. What is causing that. What are the risk factors. So we're using that. Usually in each year logical research. When you think of the prevalence this is a more permanent stage. Of the disease. We can look at that as also contributing to it will help. Within a population. And usually we used these measures. Of when we want to think about this was hired to a burden of a certain disease so what are the costs. How many beds do we need how many professionals do we need to be able to take care of these people who have a certain disease so we use it usually in policymaking for instance. And that's the difference between an instance and a prevalence. Now. All epidemiology used may be or people in the world. Like to think of other names for the same thing. As i already said. We can think about all kinds of different names for instance proportion and instance rates. Here is depicted what other named. People came up with for instances or prevalence so we talk about mobility rates mortality rates. Case fatality rate tax rates. Which are all instances. When we talk about disease rates at autopsy for instance or birth defects rates. Were thinking about preferences. So look at this table and try to to understand why the. One is a preference. And while it is an instance. Now with this clip i hope you get a feeling for the relationship between. Instance and prevalence. And when you would use an incidence and when you would use. Prevalence. Thank you very much for listening. Good bye.",

                "text": "Welcome. At this clip. About measures of the seas occurrence or frequency measures. And i'm going to talk about the incidence of the disease today. And incidence. Measures how first. People are catching a disease. So think about how fast you can get. Catch a cold. It considers the new cases. Who get the disease within a certain population. So with a prevalence you think about all cases or all the existent. Existing cases. All people have the disease. We have an incidence you're finking about all the new people who get a certain disease. So it's the number of new cases. Or it's a proportion of new cases. Within a population at risk or. It's a rate at which people are catching a certain disease. The incidence rate. I'm going to explain both of them. The first. The incidence proportion. And some people will also call this. Accumulate dative. Incident. It measures to proportion of people who develop a certain disease. With in a population. At risk and. Also in a specified period and. It's important to specify that period. So instance proportion is the number of people who develop a certain disease in that period. They find it by the number of people at risk of getting that the seas. And think of that. At risk because if you're looking at for instance the incidence of variant cancer. Remember that only women are at risk of that disease. Ok. You can you can calculate an instant's proportion. Only if you're able to follow that population completely. Only when there's no loss of. Follow up. And you can call it then you can call it a risk. If an average risk. Of the population is the same as an incidence proportion. But you need a complete follow up. Here you see an example of a cumulative instance or. Instance proportion. These are twelve. Persons who are followed up for a month. So that's doable. Only twelve people you follow up for a month. Probably is no loss to follow up no competing mortality. No problems with following them. And here you can also see that some people are catching the disease those are those yellow process. And other people will not catch a disease now what is the incidence proportion or what is steve. Risk of the population. Here you can calculate this. As the number of people who get the disease and in this case are seven crosses so. Seven people. Get that disease within these twelve months. So that's point five eight. People who have the disease. Per year. And that stick your meditative instance already in says proportion. Order risk. Of the disease within a certain population. But as i said it sure seems that you can follow them forty and tie your period of time. Which is usually quite difficult in large epidemiology. All studies. That's why we often calculate instance rate. And some people call that the incidence density. And incidence rate can also be a mortality rate. An incidence rate. Is that number of people who develop a certain. Disease within a certain period. But here you do not the find it by the total number. At risk in the population. But. You calculate the number of. Personally years. When people are at risk of a certain disease. This is a difference with an instant's proportion it's not the number of people but it's a number of person years. So it's the time. Instead of the people at risk. And you can express did. This rate. In every number that you would like so. In the power of ten or hundred or five thousand. Etc etc. And here you see an example of how to calculate an incidence rate. It's not a really big population you have only five people your population but you have to follow them for eleven years. That's a total hears at risk they can always leave your study. They can be lost to follow up they can die of something else. And it could also be that they come in later or or earlier in your study. So this is expressed in the time of time. They are followed within the study. That's the time they have been at risk. So the first person for instance has been at risk for six years and. The second person came in later in the study. But also work was followed for a longer period of time so i was also in the study for six years. Now if you. If you look at the number of years at risk of. Each participant. You have the total number of person years. If you calculate the incidence rate then you define it. The yellow process so the number of events did number of people. Get the disease in that period. The find it by the total number of person years in her study. And that's your insurance rate. And that's point. Of five three. In this study. Now for instance as an example look at the. Estimates of incidence rates here in south africa. Overall you see that the incidence rate of infection has decreased over the years in south africa. From two point zero to one point three. You also see that. When you look at the different. Age categories or you look at men and women you see some differences. The incidents raise. Of hiv infection is higher in women especially high among women who are fifteen to twenty four years old. But in both groups it declined over the years. If you look at the men. You see that the incidence rate is lower than it is in women. But you also see that. The infection. Increased. The incidence rate increased in men. In a younger age period. From twelve fifteen to twenty four years old. So this can teach you something about. What are we dealing with. Who is getting the disease in the certain period of time. And what can we do about it. When you think about calculating an instance where you have to make a distinction between can i calculate an instance proportion. Or an incidence rate. You have to think about what kind of a population do i have to have an open population. Or do i have a close population. And we have a close population. It's a fixed mentorship. Nobody can get in or out. Now think about for instance. Birth cohort. Who are recruited on the date. Of their birth. If you can't you can't change that anymore. And you can follow up everybody. So there's nobody lost. To follow up. Everybody's followed. In this case you can calculate an instant's proportion. But you can also go. Incidence rate. If you want. If you want to take the person years into account. With an open cohorts. Are sometimes called a dynamic population. You can take new members within your population that any point of time. Also people can be lost to follow up. At any point of time. They can move out or. In for. Since take a university population like battening university. The number of our students remains the same. But every year. Other students are moving in and moving out. So your population. Is dynamic. It's changing all the time. And you don't have any follow up when the students are leaving. So they lost a follow up to the measure of the caesar curds here is not an instance of proportion. Only. Incidence rate. You can take the number of peers. Person years. That the students. Accounted to your study. Into account. When they were at risk. So i hope that with this clip. You have learnt about the incidents you know what a difference between. Incidents and a preference is. You know the difference between an incidence proportion and an instance rate. And when you are able to calculate it. Thank you very much for listening.",

                "text": "Welcome. At this clip. About disease. Occurrence. Or frequency measures and now i'm going to talk to you about the prevalence of the disease. The prevalence proportion. The proportion of people. In a population who have a certain disease. At a given point of time. And that given point of time is really important for you to specify. So the prevalence proportion. Are all those people who have a certain disease. The fight is by the total number of people. In a population. For example you can think of the prevalence of age i feel. Infection in the world. And this picture. Gives you a go global few. Of hiv prevalence in the world. In two thousand and ten. And you can see that there are red dark red. Parts of the world are highly infected. Infected by age or iffy. So the prevalence of age or if he is high in those populations. You can also look at one population and look at the trend. Of the prevalence of a certain disease or. Hiv infection in this case. In sub-saharan africa. For instance. And you can see the proportion order. Percentage of people who have that. Disease with in sub-saharan sub-saharan africa. In these different time periods and you see that this repertory increasing. With the prevalence you can make a distinction between a point. Prevalence and a period prevalence now the. Point prevalence you can think of as a sort of list snapshot. One point in time that you're interested in. For instance. The first of january. With a period prevalence you're interested in a longer period of time. Maybe the first month of the year january. You're interested in or. A whole week or a month. Or year. Whatever. But that's a period. And not a point. So we have this clip. I hope you now know what a. Prevalence of disease is that you know there's a difference between a point prevalence and a period. Preference. Thank you for listening. Good bye.",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this clip. About correlation. In our square. In simple regression. Before we start. I will show you again. Where we are on the map. But actually over here in the very last clip. Of this subject so if you're frowning your brows now. Don't worry. There will be another subject next. We're going to talk about correlation wise that. Well. That's because regression. Is about a relationship between two variables say. Why next. But correlation. Is about. Association between two variables as well. Beers and correlation. Is actually measuring the strength of association between two. Quantity of variables. And it's actually measuring the leni or strength. That's important. A situation like this is easy for correlation. You have a positive correlation. The two variables tend to move up or down. Together over here we have a negative correlation. When one variable goes up. The other will tend to go down over here. There is no correlation. It's a circular. Cloud of points. So. X. and y. in this case. Are actually independent and the tricky part is over here. There is a clear relationship between y n x. But the correlation. Is going to be zero. Nevertheless. That's because correlation measures the linear. Association and the best fit best fitting line. Is a horizontal line. Suggesting that there is no. Association at all. So be careful with the correlation. It has it's limitations. It's in between minus one and one correlation. And it's a metric. Doesn't matter whether you calculate the correlation between x. and y. or between why next. Points x.y.. Sampling points. Are perfectly on the straight line. When you are at the extremes. Either correlation is one that case we have an upward line. Or correlations minus one where we have a downward line. When x. and i are independent. Like in this picture that we have seen before. Correlation is zero. Unfortunately the reverse is not true. When the correlation is zero. We have seen an example. It doesn't necessarily mean that. X. and y. are independent. So be careful with non-linear relationships. That's called flying in. This is called pearson. His name is actually connected to the correlation coefficient. Ok. Correlation is a population parameter like b. to zero like b. to one likes it must quit absolute. And we have to estimate it from data. The estimate is usually called r.. And when we're only talking about x. and y.. We can leave out the subscripts. When we have a random sample of pairs x. y. y. y. y. running from one to n.. This is actually how the estimate looks like. It looks quite formidable. With a sum of products. Into the nominator. And in a numerator story and a square root of two sums of squares. In the moment i'd. But of course. Our can calculate this value. Easily. For you. Now suppose that we're interested in association between y. next. We have already seen that we can either test. Whether be the one. Is zero in regression. But ultimately fleet. Of course we can also test whether the correlation is zero. In both cases you get a t. test. The test that they stick. For the correlation. Looks like this looks a bit gruesome. With. All the square roots and even a square of the correlation. But it's easy to calculate. And you can refer to a t. distribution. Degrees of freedom. R. and minus two. Actually the degrees freedom. Of the sum of squares of errors in regression. On the right. It looks more familiar. We have the estimate for b. to one minus. The value from another but this is zero. Divided by the standard bearer and we refer to the same t. distribution. Now. Of course. You can sit and think for a long time. To decide whether to use this one. Or that one. But fortunately there is no need to do so because they are actually decide the outcome for the taste. Left and right. Will be to say so. Is an exercise for you to actually check for the lea need. Data that this is the case. So here you have the one expression. And the other. Here you have results from regression. Here you have results from correlation. Please take your time. Stop the clip now. And when you're ready come back. Oh yes the answer. This is the expression for correlation. We take our correlation from here. And is ten. For the carcass data. So we can easily calculate the outcome. It's over here. That's a t. fail you. In case of regression it's more easy. You can read. The estimate for the slope. And a standard error. But you can't directly read the t. value. And it's the same. Minus nine point five zero zero eight. We made up here. Before. So you can see that the outcomes are indeed. The same for the caucus state. Now there's a small method of sampling. For a proper interpretation of correlation. You need a venom sample. If you don't have a random sample. The correlation. Will either be inflated. Or deflated but it will be suspect. In simple. Aggression. You don't necessarily have to take of in them sample. You're actually allowed. And it is even profitable to select the carcasses. On the basis of the fed they have to. X.. If you're aiming for a wide range of values of x.. You get more accurate estimates for intercept and slope. Because if the points are widely spread with respect to x.. It becomes more easy to fit the line. If you take them close together you have a block of points. And the line might feed. So. Regression. In contrast a correlation is. Asymmetric we want to say something about why with use of and then variable. Given the value of x.. And whether x. is a result of random selection. Or whether you have selected the values of x. yourself is immaterial. I warning. A rather important warning actually. We have an outlier over here. And if you calculate a correlation with this outlier. Included. You get quite a different value. Then when you calculate the correlation. Without the outlier. So. Correlation is very sensitive to outlying observations. The same holds for aggression. When this point is included. The line will be something like this. When you exclude the point. It will be like that. You can see that it makes a considerable difference. So don't. Just trust the numbers. But look at the plots as well and be careful with outlying observations. Ok. Our square. An important subject in this clip. Are square. Is actually the square of the correlation between x. and y.. That in itself is not very spectacular. The reason that people look a lot. At our square is that it has an other interpretation. Too. Namely that you can show that it is the rate of the so much christopher question. And the total sum of stress or. If you like. One minus the ratio of the error sum of. Press. And a total sum of squares this is the proportion of variation in y. explained by x.. And the closer to one. The better. We think. The model will fit the data. This is the same output. About least squares as the mason if you've seen before. But there's a little bit more. And actually in here. You can find the value of our square. It's point nine two. Which is pretty good. R. squared is called. The proportion of variation explained in y.. But it's also called the coefficients of determination. Now to warnings about our scripts. First of all. It's a square. Of a correlation. So it will be sensitive to outliers too. And second. And even more important. Are square is often regarded as a measure of quality of fit of the model. The closer to one the better. But it also depends upon the design. If your points. For the explanatory variable. Are close together. Our square will tend to be small. If your points are widely spread and. You can choose them yourself in many cases. Asquare will tend to be larger. So you can influence. Our square by the design. It doesn't only depend upon the model. So if you compare competing. Models. You should compare them. On the same dataset. And not on different datasets because that can be terribly misleading. In summary. The test whether a correlation is zero is actually the same as the test whether the slope and simple regression is zero correlation is symmetric. Regression is not for. Estimation of correlation. You absolutely need a random sample. For fitting a regression line. You do not ask where is frequently quoted. But it depends upon the design of the fitted line in the regression including. The estimated slope. Be to one head. The correlation. R. and r. square. Are all quite sensitive to outliers. Well this was the last clip about simple regression. So when we meet again. It will be with another subject. Thanks.\n",

                "text": "Hello. Welcome back to the subject of one way in over. We're going to talk about. Estimation and standard errors. And i will show you on the map where we are. We're actually over here. We just discussed the model. We're now going to talk about estimation. We'll turn to testing. The last two clips. Pairwise comparison and confidence intervals will be the last subjects discussed. Well yes. The tomato date again. Here you have to dataset. We had three types of tomato. Ground beef or cherry. And for each. We had to taste. What interested in. Systematic differences in. Taste. Between the three types of tomato. So we need. Tests. Estimates. Standard errors. And confidence intervals. Generally speaking. So this will influence. This is the model. We discussed it before and type number three is to reference over here. What we want. Is estimates for. Population means. But more particularly. More interesting. Are estimates between these population means they estimate for the differences. To one. And taught to direct parameters in the model. And actually. The difference between. The round. And the beef tomatoes. The new one minus butu is the same as the difference between two one and talk to so. If you specify. Our policies. About you want you to and you three. And you're interested in differences. You can also talk about the toss to toss or call t. effects. By the way. But also interested in estimation. Of the variance that is common to all three types of tomato. And we want of course standard errors to go with the estimates. Now. The estimate for the mean i for the ifb type is simply estimated by the corresponding sample mean y. bar. I so just. The some of the observations. Forty i've sample. Divided by. The sample size. In this case. The sum of the taste of four tomatoes. Divided by four. Because all the sample sizes for the tomatoes. Are for a difference between two population means. Of course is estimated by. The difference between. The sample mints. So the estimate for tall one. Which was the difference between type one and type three three was the reference remember. Is the sample mean. For type one. Minus the sample mean. For type three. Service is all quite easy and straightforward. Standard errors. Maybe a little bit less easy and straightforward. I hope that you'll recall that the standard deviation. Of a sample mean like y. bar one. Is actually the standard their view action of a single observation which is sigma epsilon. Divided by the square root of the sample size. The sample size. In the meat in the case of the tomatoes it's the square root of four. Hence the standard there. Of no one head. You one head. Is the same as y. bar one is the standard definition of y. bar one. Again. Sigma excell over square root of four same expression. To refresh your mind a little about standard errors in standard definitions. A standard error. Is just a standard def yes should. So the standard error. Of your one head. Is the same as the standard deviation. Of your one head. Which is the square root of a variance. It just happens that. If we're talking about an estimate or. Extend the definition is called a standard ever. Because it is a measure of ecu receipt of the estimate of the smaller. The standard there are the better. Right but interested in the. Francis. So for instance. Told one. The difference between type one and type three. What is the standard there. For tour one head. It's the square root of the variance of tall one head. And tall one head. Is the difference between two. Sample meets the variance of the difference. Because the two sample means are independent. Is the sum of the variances. Over here and. Each of these variances has the same form. Sigma epsilon square. Over the sample size. In case of the tomatoes. Both sample sizes are four. So you end up with the expression over here. And once we have an estimate for sigma epsilon square. We can calculate the standard outer. How do we estimate sigma absolute square. Well we can start by. The sample variance of. Each of the separate samples. We have in general. K. of them. This is the sample variance. Of the i think sample. And since the variances for all types of tomato for all populations are supposed to be the same. We will pool. These sample variances. We do so by multiplying. Each of them. With the sample size minus one. What is going to happen is that when you multiply by and one minus one. This term will disappear. So if you add the terms together. You get one big sum of squares with two summations because we have two superscripts. And we divide by the sum of the sample sizes. Each of them reduced by one. So in the end we will have the total sample size and. Minus the number of four place and scale. So in case of the tomatoes. We have four plus four plus four is twelve for capital and that's the total sample size. And we substract. Three. Because we have three times. What about least squares estimation because we talked about that before for regression. Well. Formally. You can. If you want to minimize this sum of. Where's an analogy with what we did with simple regression. And if you do so you get the same estimates that we discussed before. For instance the least graphs estimates for the toss. Will indeed be differences between. Sample maids. So. Indeed. We're still using the squares. Now. And all that has to regression. We can define fitted values. And residuals again. A fitted value is actually. The estimate for the systematic part of the model and. This is the estimate from you why. Which was the sample mean. Why i bar. The residual. And estimate for the error term of the model. Is the observation. Minus the fit if l. you and. Since the fit value of sample mean. You simply take your profession and you substract. The associated sample me. The minimum sum of squares that we get. Formally poly squares. Is the sum of squares residuals. Again. Two summations. But i forgot. One. J here. Sorry for that. And you get this big sum of squares. For what we still call. The sum of squares of error. Like before. Now we can revisit the estimation for sake maps on square then. Because this was the expression that we derived on a previous life. But actually this big sum of squares. Is the s.s.e.. The sum of squares procedurals. So our estimate for sigma absolute square. Is actually the s.s. eat. Divided by. And minus k.. And when we define this as the mean square for ever and minus k. being the degrees of freedom. Associated with us as we like before. The estimate for sigma epsilon square is the main square. No change. With respect to. Simple regression there. So in summary. And you know from all the name. Will be explained. But not yet. Like in simple regression. Parameters. Re presenting the population means. Can be estimated by the squares but there's no need to do so because you get rather straightforward results. Sample means. And differences between sample means just what you would expect similar to regress. We have residuals. And fitted cell use and. The estimate for the sigma epsilon square. Is like before the mean square forever. Thanks for your attention. And see you in a next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello again. Welcome to this clip. About one way in elf are we going to talk about the f. test. And the innova terrible. But first let me show you where we are. We're actually in the last play part one. We talked about the model. We talked about estimation instead of theirs. And now we're going to talk about the f. test. And in the next and last clip. We will discuss the t. test. We sort of follow the same lines as in simple linear regression. The tomatoes again. You have the three dives. Ground beef or cherry. We have their sweet taste and. Wanted to state whether there are systematic differences between these three types. With respect to sweet taste. This is the an over table. It looks very much the same as in simple regression. At the f l you have the f. test. Is over here and again. It is a test that can be used to see whether. Variable x.. In this case the type of tomato. That's predictive value for response why. Sweet eyes. And of course. Because we only have three types of tomato. It's actually a test to see whether there are differences among the population means for taste for the three types. And like. In simple regression. Before we get into the details. We need to discuss. The other ingredients. Of the you know the table first. Again. The three sums of squares. The total sum of squares. The treatment sum of squares which is replacing the regression sum of squares from before. And the error sum of squares. As as any. Are connected. To different parts of the model. So the only change is that the regression. Sums grass. That is connected to the systematic part of the model. Is now called the treatment. Sum of squares. The three types of tomato. Being regarded as treatments. The total sum of squares is the same as before. And since we have twelve observations. We have eleven degrees of freedom now. Because we have twelve. Differences with sample mean again. But they add up to zero. So only eleven. Can be freely chosen. The value for the sum of squares. The total sum of squares by the way. Is two thousand three hundred twenty one point seven one one. And we did calculate that by r. in general. The degrees of freedom. Are capital and. Minus one for capital and. Is to total sample size twelve. In the case of the tomatoes. The solid grounds of error. We discuss that one in a previous clip. Is simply the sum of squared differences. Of the observations with their. Associated sample means and. When we divide. The sum of squares of error. By its degrees of freedom. We get the mean square for error. Which is the estimate for sigma epsilon square. In this case. The estimate will be one hundred and twenty six point zero two. Here you have our model. With the cornerstone representation again and. Type number three is shown to be the reference. On the left in red there why the arrow. Is indicating the variation in y. totally ignoring. X.. Meaning. Totally ignoring the type of tomato and. In the picture in green. You see the variation. Around. Each of the separate. Means for the three types of tomato. And again. It seems that the green variation. Is smaller than the red fairly ation. That means that. Part of the variation in y. is explained by differences among the types of tomato. The part explains of the total variation in y.. By the three types of tomato that's the sum of squares for treatments. It's a difference between the total sum of squares and the ever sum of grass. And its. One thousand one hundred and eighty seven point five. There are two degrees of freedom. Connected. Now. We had one single degree freedom for the sum of squares of error. We have two now for the sum of squares of treatment. You will see in a moment why. And i mean square for treatments is now the sum of aggressive treatments. Over two which gives us. Five hundred and ninety three point seven five. Why did two degrees of freedom. Well. The leeway for explaining variation in. Taste. By the three types of tomato. Is through. Two parameters. To one and tor to remember. Two or three is zero. You can also say. If you want. The contribution of variation between three needs to the total variation. You'll need to use. Two differences between these means. So we have two degrees of freedom. Associated with the sum of squares for treatments actually and not. Regression. In general. The number of degrees of freedom. Will became minus one. One less than the number of. Populations that we have has the an over table again. The ingredients will be familiar now. This is the f l u and. It is the means graph or treatments. Used to be the mean square for aggression. Over the mean square for error. It is a test whether the two toss are equal to zero. First s.t.l. turnit if that. At least one of them. Is not. Which is the same as. Test for the three means being equal. First is the alternative that. At least two of them are different. And again. Like before. Large values of f. support. The alternative hypothesis. Because they suggest that this is the magic part of the model. Is more important than the random part b. is an f. distribution again. For calculating the p. value. The f. distribution. Is the distribution of the test. istic. Under the novel to says. We have the two degrees of freedom. The of one and the of two again this time. The if one is to. Because the knowledgeable to says involves two parameters instead of one. And the if two. Again. Is the degrees of freedom. Derived from the sum of squares of ever. Twelve minus three. Is nine. In this case. Here you have a picture of the f. distribution. Involved as indicated is the outcome of the f. test. And the area to the right. In blue. And you can read the area. From the our output. As well it's point zero three nine eight. That's the p. value. Is be a low point zero five. So. Four point seven one one for our outcome for f.. Is a very unlikely outcome. When the null hypothesis is true. Therefore. We reject the nano poultices. Invasion of the alternative. And we have shown that. At least two of the types of tomato. Have different. Population needs for sweet taste. In summary. Then over model. Derives its name from the innova table where we decompose. The variation. We did the same thing in regression actually but somehow the name has become attached to the present model. We have three sums of squares. One for total. One for treatments. Used to be two regressions almost press and one for error the esta to stick is to arrive from the means graph for treatment and the mean square for error. And you can use it to test whether there are differences among the population means. And to calculate the p. value. We use the f. distribution again. Thanks for your attention. And see you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello. Welcome to this clip. About one way in alpha. We're going to talk about a t. test. Pairwise comparisons. And confidence intervals. But first let me show you where we are in the map. We are actually arrived at the last clip. Of this series. We've talked about the model. About estimation. About the f. test. Will follow up with a t. test and. Pairwise comparisons. And confidence intervals. The tomatoes again. We're still interested in their sweet taste. We have three types round beef or cherry and wanted to state whether their research. Systematic difference. Among these three types. With respect to sweet ice. Now. In a previous clip. We had this result. For the f. test. The p. value was point zero three nine eight one. It was below zero point zero five. So. Actually the f. test shows that there are differences among the three types. But. Are all three types different from each other or are two types the same. And is the third one. Different from the other two. We don't know. We need to find out more. And we will do so by making pair wise comparisons. Among the types of tomato. With a t. test so that's where the t. test is coming in will make three pairwise comparisons one for psystar three type two first start three. And last. Type one. First type two formally. We are testing. Free now liable to says. One about type one for start three. One about two first three and one about. One. First two. And because these two differences. Are also equal to tall one and toward two. We could. Rephrase the whole thing. In terms of total one being zero or two to top two being zero. And the last one over here the difference between new one and you two is to say. As the difference between the two toss. So when we're talking about differences among types of tomato. We can talk about toss. All the time. And again. They are called the effects. The treatment effects. Now to teach us let's take ground first as cherry. As an example. The knowledgeable to says is that. The difference tall one. Is zero. The alternative is that it is not the tea. Is the estimate for toll. Mine is the value from the knowledge but since with you zero. Divided by the standard bearer. The tall one head. Is just the difference between. The sample means for type one and type three and a standard there is therefore. The standard definition of this difference. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. That will be the sum of the variances. Of the two means. And each one is sigma epsilon square. Divided by the sample size which is four. For both times. For the tomatoes. And we need to estimate sigma absolute square. And we have already seen that the. Estimate for signatures on square. Is the mean square. For error. So that's how our t. test. Actually looks like. We can refer this to a tedious to be ocean and. As always the number of degrees of freedom. Is the number of degrees of freedom from the sum of squares for error. And minus k. twelve minus three nine. In this case. Here's an exercise for you. Here you have. Output. Showing the least squares as to mit's you. To one or two and two of the pairwise comparisons. Are already in the table below. The question is which two comparisons are they that is one. Comparison missing. And you're asked to make this. Third comparison. By hand. What are your conclusions. And finally. What is the interpretation of the. Number fifty four point six one in here. That is indicated as. Intercept by our. So please take your time to find the answer. Stop the video. Come back. When you're ready. Here are the answers. In the table. You will find. Round first is cherry and beef. First is cherry. That's because cherry. Is the reference. Cherry is not in there. It's only. R. and b. that you find in the table. The p. values. They are in the output. Are both smaller than point five so we conclude that there is a significant difference between cherry and round to night outs. And between cherry and beef tomatoes. And actually from the sign of the differences. They were negative. We can conclude that cherry. Has systematically. Higher taste. Then. Round or beef tomatoes. The missing comparison is between round and beef the t.v l. yeast the difference between the two sample means. Divided by to stand there. You can calculate the standard there by hand. But it's actually the same standard error. That has been used for the other two differences so you can read it from the output as well. The t.v. is very small. Close to zero. And the p. value is very large you use the t. distribution with nine degrees of freedom again. P. values point nine one. It's far beyond. Point zero five there is no indication whatever that. Round and beef tomatoes. Are significant a difference article close in is that we cannot show that there is a difference between them. Enticed. It doesn't mean that they taste the same. It only means that we cannot show that there is a difference. The value. Fifty four point eight six one. Is actually the sample mean for cherry tomatoes. Because that was the reference. So dimmu. Is actually the level. Cherry tomatoes. That is estimated by this. Sample me. Now artists that they stick. Will give us a significant result. When. In absolute value. It exceeds a critical value. From the t. distribution. That's the alternative. For using a p. value to t.c.l. is a value. From the t. distribution. Still with the nine degrees of freedom from. Some stress of error. Where to the right. Of this value. We have over two point zero two five. Ok so you can look up this number or. Ask your favorite computer program which is art. In this course. You can rewrite this we can multiply by the standard error and move it to the right hand side. So we have a significant result. When the absolute difference between the two sample means. Exceeds this. Quantity over here. To zero. Times the standard error. We call that. The least significant difference. L.s.d. for short. So to mainz that differ more than the others d. are significantly different. And the others the method. Is actually due to fisher. So when you have equal sample sizes. The lsd is the same for all pairs of means. And in that case. It is the t.c. at all times instead of there and instead of there we have seen before its square root of two times am is the. Over. N. where n. is four for the two made ups. We can look up the ts hero. Here you have to t. distribution with nine degrees of freedom. And here you have two point two six. Which is the value with point zero two five. To the right. So the t zero will be two point two six over here. You can calculate the elysee it's seventeen point nine four. So any two means that are further apart than seventeen point nine four. They are significantly different. So the i was the as a yardstick. You can try to fit in between two means to see whether di differ significantly or not when. Pairwise comparisons are only performed. After the f. test is significant. We say that the other is the med that is. F. protected. Although the effort to act as well as the method is used quite often it's. Theoretical basis. Is somewhat weak. There are alternative approaches for pairwise comparisons. And they protect against so called experiment wise error. An important example is. To peace approach. This is beyond the scope of our present course. And the opinions about the expediency of general use of such methods are rather different. But there is more than fisher's alice to your love. Now bit about notation. This is one way to denote the final result. We have the three types of tomato. The three means in this case ordered from high to low. And any two means in here. That share a common. Letter over here. Are not significantly different so round and before not different they share a b. but cherry is different from round in beef. Because it doesn't share a common letter. The same notation can also be used from left to right. In this case from low to high. Using a superscript. And now. We start on the left with two. Ace. Because beef. And round. Are not different. And we have a before cherry so cherry doesn't share the same superscript. As beef. And round. It's different from the other two but beef and rounds share the same and they are not significant different. And finally. This is the third option. Again we order from low to high and. We give the means that are not significant different. A common. Underline rather than a common superscript. Or a comma. Letter. These are the three. Notations that are most used a little bit about confidence intervals for its paralyzed. Difference. A conference into four may be constructed that's of course good statistical practice. So for round. First as gerry for instance. Type one first dive three. The converse interval is the estimate. Plus or minus a multiple the same to zero. We had before. Of the standard error. This part is actually the i was d.. So to converse interval is simply the difference between the sample means. Plus or minus the alice d. and. For round first cherry. In this case. This would be the interval that we get. Now what's the practical use of such an interval i'm not a tomato expert by the way. But. Just imagine. We have the interval here. Running for minus thirty eight point five five to minus two point six seven. And suppose that you are a company. You're contemplating. To change from round to cherry tomatoes or to increase your production of cherry tomatoes. In the market. And you're interested. Whether it is useful to make p.r. for cherry tomatoes or not. Let's say that they are more expensive than the other tomatoes. It could be that. If the difference in taste is thirty five or so that it is commercially. Appealing because then the difference in taste. Would make it worthwhile for consumers to pray. Higher price. It can also be that if the difference in taste is only two that. It is not. Watch enough to convince people to change the cherry tomatoes. Now. From the end of all you can see that the lower bound in absolute value. Is close to thirty five. The upper bound in absolute value is closer to the conclusion is that our experiment. Is inconclusive. In that respect. We cannot see. On the basis of the interval. Whether it would be commercially worthwhile. Or not to make p.r. for cherry. Tomatoes. So we need a more narrow interval. Which means that. In that case. If we have this in mind. We need a larger experiment. So that's something. A confidence interval can tell you. In summary. After the f. test. We call that. F. protect. Protection. Means maybe compared paralyzed by the t. test. But there are also people who use. Pairwise comparisons even. When the f. test is not significant. Anyhow. It is. Fisher's l.s.d. method and the other is the as a yardstick. Where it fits in between two means. They are significantly different. It is good statistical practice to present. Estimated differences. And test results. Together with standard errors. But also confidence intervals. This was the last clip about. One way and over. Perhaps we will meet again with another subject.

                "text": "Hello welcome to this first clip. About a new subject one way in over immigration we were intrastate what we could say. About a response variable why. On the basis of the explanatory variable x.. And in regression. Both of these variables are quantities. Now suppose that. One of them. The y. is quote that is. But that he explained three variable x. is quality if that's the situation we're going to deal with. Now. Here's an example. We have three types of tomato. Ground beef or. Cherry tomatoes. And we're interested. Whether the sweet taste. Why. Is systematically. Different between these three types of tomato. The x. variable in this case. The explanatory variable. Is the type of tomato. And it only takes three. Possible values. We have for tomatoes. Of each type. And we assure you that these are written them samples of size four. From free populations. Of tomatoes. So the response is to taste. The explanatory variable is the type of tomato. We're interested in systematic differences in taste. Between these types. We need to test. Estimates. Standard errors. And confidence intervals. In more general terms. We have. K. populations. And we take random samples from each. Sizes are. And one. Up to and. K k s three. For the tomatoes and. The sample sizes. All three are equal to four. For each sample unit. A tomato. The response to sweet taste why. Is measured. We have. Unknown population means. You one of two. U.k.. And we wonder whether there are differences among them. If so what is the size. If these differences. So again. A test. Estimates. Standard errors and finally. Confidence intervals are required. A little bit in between a population mean like. New one is actually the. F. rich. Sweet taste. Of all tomatoes in the population. Of round. Tomatoes. We will never know what it is because we cannot possibly taste them all. When one tomato. Is randomly sampled from this population. We can talk about it's expected to fail you eat of why. By definition. It is actually the everything the long run over. All possible samples. Of size one. And you will understand that that is actually does same as the population mean. In this case. So we can talk about and. Population mean. Or about an expected value. Now we're going to build a model. We have why i.j.. To sub scripts now. One eye for type. And one other. Substrate for the number of the tomato. Within each time. We go on to build up the model on the right hand side of the expression. Starting with a base level new. And we going to add contributions toll one two or two and two or three to new. To get the three. Population meets the red dots are the population means for round. Beef and cherry tomatoes. And finally we have the. Ever terms. Epsilon. That will give us. Individual. Observations. So that's the kind of model we have in mind. There is a little problem here. We have. Parameters mew. To one to two and two or three that's four parameters. And there are only three. Population means for the tomato so we have a parameter to may. We need to drop one. Well one popular way to do so is to be shown at one. After tours is zero. In this case. I will shew that. Two or three. Is zero. So here is the base level again. But since two or three is zero. We noted the red dot for cherry. Is right on this base level. Had we at all one and two are two again. To get the other. Population means note that the population means are still in the same positions we moved. The base level. By changing its definition. And of course we have the same observations again. Type three cherry tomatoes. Are called the reference. And new is the mean of type three. There are other side conditions. That you can make there less popular. By now. We have the sum to zero condition. We have shown that the sum of the tours is zero. So you can. If you know. K. minus one of the toss the last one will follow. Death case mewe is the overall mean. Of the three types. Rather than the mean for the reference type. And finally. There is a repressed interation without any toss. Just the new one you two or mew three. Will be in there. Now let's stick to the cornerstone representation because that's the one most popular in software. And let's assume that. Two or three. Is zero. So new one is new plus tall one you can see it in a little box on the right. You two is mule plus two or two. And you three. Is just new. Because two or three is zero. To one is the difference between. The means for type one and type three top two is the difference between the means for type two and type three. So you can see the types one and two. Are expressed. Relative to type three. That's why. Type three is called. The reference. And it's very convenient. But in stating differences among the types and. Two of them are already there. Represented by. Separate parameters. In the model. Here's an exercise for you. In reality. Population means of course. Are unknown. We can only guess. But in an exercise. We can assume that they are no. Let's say that they are. Thirty four thirty three and fifty four. And supposed to type three is the reference what are the values of you to one or two and two or three. So please stop the video in a moment. Think about the answer and. Return when you're ready. Is the answer. Type three is the reference. So new is actually the level. For type three. Which was fifty four. And by definition. Two or three is zero to one. Is the difference between type one and type three. That will be thirty four minus fifty four times twenty. And likewise. Toward two is the difference between type two and three. Which is minus twenty one. So we have actually expressed. New one as fifty four. Plus minus twenty. You two as fifty four. Plus minus twenty one. And you free as. Fifty four plus zero. The other terms epsilon we haven't discussed them. Yet. Share the same assumptions that we had before. For. Linear regression. So they are mutually independent. And that means that we need. Random samples from the different populations. They are normally distributed around zero. And we have shown that they have the same variance. Sigma absent square. For all three types of tomato. So in the model. There will be. Parameters mew. To one or two and sigma epsilon square. That we need to estimate. Still assuming a two or three. Is zero. This is not a view of the model. We have three normal distributions. They all of the same shape. Because they have the same variance. But they are. Shifted. Relative to each other they don't necessarily have the same. Needs. And what interested in the differences between the meets. There are some differences and some similarities with simple regression. On the left. Have to present model. For one way and over with free means for the tomatoes. They can be anything. They are the three dots on the right. There are also free dots in the simple regression model. But there are actually. Infinitely many means involved here because with any change of facts. The mean of y. will change as well and. All these mes will have to be on a straight line which is an extra condition. But the two models. Share the same assumptions about their in terms of salaam. Re presenting variation. Around a means around. The red dots. In summary. In a simple regression model both y. and x.. Are quantity if. But in the one way an over model and. I still need to explain the name i will do so in the next clip. The why is quantity if button. X. is. Quality of. Most common is the cornerstone representation of the model. One of the levels of the experimental fact there will be the reference. We give stock three here. And the other levels are expressed. Relative to this reference to data are shown to be random samples. Possibly of unequal size from normal distributions with the same shape. They share the same variance and possibly. Different location. Thanks for your attention. See you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Welcome in this enormous clip. But i will discuss the physical changes that can occur. To proteins and how they will change the properties. Before i continue it is very important to make sure that you know what i mean by physical changes compared to chemical changes. Physical changes are defined by the fact that they are. Mancow fade and. Bulbs are not changes in aggregation or whatever that do not involve. Chemical boards on bombs. So what do we have you have. Electrostatic interactions. I love public interactions. Either engine boards and front of our forests. These are the four major. Interactions that we consider in the field of protein biochemistry. In addition. Chemical changes in full of chemical board so and next on that they shared between two atoms. That this changed. And this can be. For instance the peptides ball and that this being hydrolyzed. Or the deisel five ball and that this being broke or the physical changes then. For instance are. The nature of the in that situation and unfolding. These poses as or good when the politics is heated one poses a heath and typically above the din that sedation temperature. With his for food proteins in the order of sixty to eighty degrees celsius. The enfolding takes place in a timescale of seconds. Midi seconds to seconds. And then is. Stimulated because the heat. Gives all the parts of the protein molecule more mobility at some point this kinetic mobility of the change is so fast. And so high that the change. Unfolds and then the in. Interactions that were stabilizing the structure are being broken. As a consequence of that unfolding pose as we get an exposure of the height of. Because that were previously hidden in the interior of the posing. And then also we get exposure of the dies of our bombs and. Cecil hi little groups. The groups that were buried in the inside of the posing as well. Of course a grandee the. We have more he activity. The process of. Unfolding. Leads to a gauge untypically because of the exposure of hydrophobic corpse. It is important to the allies that aggregation can also occur and i select a point sometimes we forget this we get. Unfolding an aggregation but also around i select the points we get education. For native postings without unfolding. So let's have a look at what happens during the unfolding process. At the sides of the room temperature if i slaved both in for instance from ak white women. We have a native searcher of the protein. Global or protein so we have some health effects and beat us heat if i start heating. As mentioned the movement increases we get an unfold of clothing. And that can still be pirates. Of alpha helix they can still be part of the that sheath this depends on the type of clothing. And also the extent of unfolding. But most of the protein has lost. The fixed. Surgery and fixed second that his stature. At this moment if i would cool down the system. Now had two choices for the posing. From the informed of proteins are in a very dilute solution. I only have that say one for the posting. If i would go to down. It can fold back to the native states or it kind of falls back to where he fall that state. And these are not identical. And this depends a little bit on the type of quoting again how this happen. But many people forget this. We sink. If i hate opposing it and fault. This is correct. But at the same time if i call down. Typically a party will he fold. It will he fault. Unless actually. Aggregation takes place. And aggregation takes place. If there is sufficient attraction between the proteins. Because of the exposure of the hydrophobic oops in the unfolded state. There's much more hydrophobic effects in between the protein molecules. So even at the ph. Away from the as unlikely point. But the native protein is soluble and for the posing made of silt in education. And therefore a loss of all your ability. And depending on the conditions. The aggregates can actually cluster together and form a see them mentioned all network which we call a gel. And this is in the end what you get when you board an ak. So for x.. Basically we go from native to unfolded to accurate data. To a network. The gel don't work as have for the extreme example of what happens but what's in a less severe case where i don't need to make a gel. So at that moot. Concentrations of protein for instance. What happens is that. I lose the so you ability after heating. For for better not for global in a way poti. I have a minimum of the say ability in the i select a point. Yeah it's not fairly sharp it's not fair to shallow. But that is a minimum and i select the points if i heat. The protein for different amount of time you see that the loss of full your ability is mostly pronounced and i select a point. If i hid under different conditions. The solubility can already be decreased. If i'm away from the i select weak point that the. The time will feed thing on the temperature of heating and the extent of unfolding. And then there are two different processes that can take place. And said he died due to course at asians. Achatz will form. But the aggregates. Are so. Dilute in the in the solution that they don't meet a lot. And basically they just fall out of solution. Into the force of gravity. However if i have a very high protocols and station. And for normal proteins. The minimal course and patient too to see this. Delays in effect. Is around ten percent. At these high concentrations ten percent is one hundred gompa leader. After enfolding i get. Aggregates of the proteins. But in this case before the. Aggregates can fall down. All the aggregates have formed. And these closer together. And then basically i get to see them and so on that's work that stabilizes the whole thirty year and perhaps years the water. And consequently i have a gel. The important facts that. Determine these poses. And what happens is the case for you ability. Aggregation. In addition. And for the proteins. May be more prone to accessibility by enzymes. So post here later and signs to digest the peptide bombs. We can have a lot of biological activity this is important for those proteins that have and symmetric activity. And in lost points we haven't increased the activity because of the dies of our bridges. At the end of this process. And the end of this knowledge slip i have a question for you. If you considered. Two different potent solutions. But of the same quality. And you heat them. One solution forms a gel and the other does not. The question now is what is a difference between these two solutions. There may be different solutions to this question. But one answer is that the high on next things. If i change the before it will tend to solve the. Podiums. That high on extends. Or close the door i select the point. There's not a lot of bills in between the postings. So a certain extent of. Unfolding will. Result of id in education and you'll asian. At the lower your next things are far away from the ice likely point. The aggregation and the generation is a little bit. Hindered it. And therefore more quality is still the fault. So the question is if i have a high on next things. I will expect. To form a gel. Never have i have a very low iyonix thanks i deserve the potency and water. I expect to have a transparent solution. Of the fall that are native like proteins. To summarize physical changes in podiums under his belt. For instance of heating. And they are more golf in and the interactions that result in unfolding of proteins. One. Effect of this unfolding is the formation of aggregates. And an effect on the potency ability.",

                "text": "Welcome to this enormous clip where i will discuss this so you ability of proteins. So you believe it is very important in food industry because he determines many of the appearance and the properties of food products. One of the most apparent. Properties of. Consequences or so you ability. Is the appearance of the solution. So for instance if i start with pure protein solutions of lysozyme. And of album in which are positively and negatively charged that transparency allusions of proteins. But as soon as i mix them. The electrostatic. Attacks in between them. And he sells an aggregation and a target solution. In addition to the official appear them's the texture of products to me changed. Out of particles can be tasted for instance an ice cream organ moves us. In addition to so your ability determines the. Digestibility and. The foam and the milsom stabilizing properties. So many food products you can see consequences that are basically it inflexion of the properties of so you ability to sell your billeted properties depend on pope it is of the protein of course and. Interactions between the protein molecules. And these can be detected with or he will see if the electrostatic. Interactions between light charged proteins are people safe and they depend on the ph and i on next things. But as i mentioned if i mix different proteins together. I can also get attacked of interactions. In addition podiums have. Hydrophobic or non-polar mine as at side chains and. They can become exposed during. Unfolding for instance. Because they don't have a good interaction with the solvent. It tends to lead to aggregation. And the last. Your pity of proteins is that they have a minor assets. And these are constant and. Do not depend on the system conditions. So schematically. We have non-potable munch on some minor assets that don't have a good for the ability and not a good interaction with the solvent. Boulder and none chanced a mine as hits. They are constant. As a function of time and independent of the unfolding. And we have polar charge of the mine as hits. And these penny. Change the charts. State as a function of the p.a.'s and interactions depends also on the iyonix things. So where are these and mine as hits. In a protein sequence. If you look in the primary protein sequence. The amount as it seemed to be distributed to hendon be that in the folder structure of a global opposing that is the distribution of the a minor as it's. Hydrophobic non-polar a minor as it's. I'm basically in the in the core of the. Posy here he presented as a quite solid rock. In blue and had his hands that amount to as it's on the podium that are present on the outside of the. Protein on the surface and these are in the polar and polar charts. Of mine assets. And then if i. Overlap. Both parts of the protein molecule together. I get the normal global opposing off of album and they can see indeed that. All the hydrophobic amount as hits. I bet it's more or less on the inside and a small amount of them is exposed. But all the polar minor s.s.i. clearly visible on the outside of the polity molecule. This third is the germans because it is the minimal fee energy of the system. If you look to the different than mine assets. We can also see how they are distributed. Here is a list. Of the different the mind as it's the twenty a minus it's of proteins and the degree of exposure. To dissolve and. And if you look through this list above you see is a big chance of twenty percent to ninety one percent. Exposure. And if i look at what properties these a mine assets have. It is clear that. Indeed. All died of fall because mine as it. Tend to be present on the inside of the potent molecule. While the polar and the chance of mine as it's on the outside of the it. Call it a molecule. However there are two exceptions. The exceptions are cysteine and polling. Cysteine. Is present on the inside of the posy molecule. Basically because it needs to cause link. Different parts of the poaching molecule together and codeine. Even though it's quite hydrophobic is present on the outside of the poet a molecule. This has to do with the function that it breaks. The regular structure of alpha he says. Now when these poor. Properties of the protein. And the position of the man as it's weakened the star determining how it affects us or your ability. One important part as i mentioned is that john h.. And he has a chance of beth and i took global in as a function of the ph. In the i select take points. There is no child's on the podium so basically she have a chart that has no deep bills and therefore we can expect that these proteins. Start aggregating to some extent. And indeed if you look to do so you ability could have as a function of the p. eight. We do see that there is a minimum and so you ability of and i select the points of the posting here. Around five point four. At the extremes of the i selected. Point so to the left side. The lower p. aids are to the alkaline ph on the right side. You see that. So your ability increases and this is the typical behavior of. Proteins. As mentioned i all mix things is also important and that is important in two ways. The first. Effect of. I on next things is that we see other small increase of eye on next things an increase of solubility of and i select the point. We presented here. And this. You see an increase in the so you ability if i increase the only things which has expressed as the sold concentration here. To around twenty. Medium old or so not a very high concentration that he's in for this whole thing in effect as it is called. Is that the. I on the groups on the posting got a different interaction with water that is he presented in this picture. Where you can see in the native protein the car books in the group. And the fear my no hope. Then they simply shed a podium and form in this way and i am back as in this cold and. If they do this better indeed to have an interaction with it with themselves and not with the solvent. If i now at a small amount of sodium chloride the ions from the sodium chloride break. That i am put there and start interacting. Themselves with the chance to groups from the protein. Consequently does more into the action of the poet in charge scoops with the solvent and the highest for you ability. This is the salting in effect. If i increase the course of the nation of salt more and more at some point. A different factor starts playing a role. And this is that i start changing the. Solvent properties that this new presented here. And in this cold folding out effect. In a normal situation at low i your next thanks the potence are surrounded by water. Hydrated by water. But if i start adding more and more salt. Typically more of them. One mole or up to six mode are sold. And this can be sodium chloride or. Ammonium sulphate for instance that i am full of the salt. Start interacting with the water and. Very roughly speaking. This old audience take away all the water. So the water is hibernating the salt and not the protein. Consequently the protein starts. Interacting with all the podiums aggregate. And then they perceive it ate at the end of this knowledge skip. I have a question for you. If you look to this patient curve of a native poti. And you consider they could do a chemical treatment on this protein. To him move. All the fia minor groups will be the new type they think of this protein. Can you draw it. In this game. After the chemical treatment. If you remove all the fia minor groups you him move. Positive. Scientists on the podium. And as a consequence of this the. Eyes and i think point will shift to a lower p. eight. As mentioned here. In so many. If we look to the podium so you ability. There are a female factors that affect us or your military these are the presence of pono groups on the outside of the protein. Hydrophobic. Groups. On the inside. But they can become exposed and charged. Interactions and the charge interactions depend on the ph. And they depend on the eye on next things and hour or two this seems salting in. And of high cost of place and solving on.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip is about fatty acid composition. All the pits have their own fatty acid composition. And that is often how they have correct rice so we determine the fatty acid composition of the fat stores and the tri glisten right so did the fatty composition of the triglycerides and. Based on this we categorize the food in four groups. So you have to the positive fats of animals. The milk fats. The fish oils and the fetch the bull oils. I hear in this table you see to fat the up as to the composition of these four different groups by an example give an example of beef. Of milk cows milk. Herring for fish and. All of for all of oil. So for the fashionable oil. Here you have to different fatty acids. And the. The numbers that you see are depressed times that shows off each fatty acid. That is present by weight. In that certain lippitt. So for example beef half has twenty seven point four percent of the fatty acids are sixteen point zero. Up in a grey area as that is where you see the unsaturated fatty acids and the rest of the fatty acids are just saturated fat the acids. I'm going to compared to four different script now. So let's first look at beef if you look at beef thing you see it has only four different kind of fatty acids. And if you look at the difference between the saturated unsaturated fatty acid so you see it has compared to the other groups. A relative high amount of saturated soil relative high amount of. Sixteen zero here. Twenty seven percent. An eighteen zero forty two percent if you compared to the other groups than it has has a relative amount. High amount. Also it has mainly only sixteen and eighteen. Fatty acids. Then the second group is the milk. And this case cow's milk. Now what is very different from the other groups is clearly here you see the. Short chain fatty acids are all saturated forty four was zero six zero eight zero ten zero etc. And they're very small amounts but they're not present in the other group so that's a big difference between the other groups. Also some of the unsaturated fatty acids in milk. Can be a trans fatty acids and that is also very different from the other groups which do not have trans fatty acids. Now we look at the fish. From the fish probably look at the composition of herring. And now it's the other way around now you don't have to shortchange but you have the long chain fatty acids. And many of these long chain fatty acids. I have a lot of double bonds for example you have twenty two five or twenty two six. Present in the fish oil. So you have a long change. And you also have a lot of. Unsaturated because of bad. Fish all is sensitive to oxidation reactions. Now and then the last group is the vegetable oils and this case i show you an example of all of oil. It also contains primarily only to sixteen and eighteen. Just as the animal sources. But now you have in comparison to animal sources in general you have often more. Unsaturated fatty acids. Compared to the saturated fat the acids. Not in the lipitor. Fatty acids are not present as separate fatty acids but they are present mainly as try to kill guess rolls or. In short we call that. T. a g. in the lip it's not a composition of t c a g.'s is also very important to know to not only know what a fatty acid composition but also how what effect the acids combined. On the tri killed this rolls. To give that composition of the try killed this rules. We use labeling for the fatty acids. So if. If there is the sixteenth president. Into triglyceride. We use this short notation p. for poetic asked it is eighteen zero is asked for storage as hits. At sats write each fatty acid has its own coat. To say what is this fatty acid. And if we now look at these three tri killed this rolls. Then you. This tri killed this role has. L. and o. so myristic. Linoleic and oleic acid. And the second one is to appeal p. triglyceride meaning to acid have a medic acids and oleic acid in its structure. So to first. The on the as on one position. We have here to am so also to first. Number are the first letter of the code as and. Now if we now look at to try kill closer write composition of. Palm oil. Than there is here this table with. The coach of to try killed last rites and. The percentage. That is present in the palm oil. So for example it has a lot of. p.o.p.. Appeal all. And p o p. Twenty two and twenty nine percent off the triglycerides. Has this composition. And here you see examples of these molecules. And maybe you also already see now the importance of this. So not only the fatty acid composition is important but also how are the fatty acids. Connected to detroit less rights than you see to structure of the triglycerides. If it has a band that structure. It will definitely make different crystals. Than when it has no band structure. Like in this one. And this one here has even two fatty acid. Would have banned. So again. Other crystals will be formed. To try to kill this right composition. It is also important to know especially for. How will the fat. Or the lip behave from a crystallizing to fat. But i have a question for you. To hear you see though. The composition of coconut and coconut is. Maybe you know at room temperature. Maybe you've seen that in a in a can of coconut milk and that it has this fat leader on top. And it's solid at room temperature. While it is a vegetable. Fat. So my question is can you explain that. By looking at the fatty acid composition. Why it has a soul that fat. Coconut fat. If you look at affect the us with composition of coconut. Then you see that it has a lot of these small or short shorts or change fatty acids. And especially a lot of twelve zero. Meaning. A lot of this. Saturated fatty acid. And if you look at the amount of. Unsaturated compared to some three did you see it has a lot of saturated fat the acid. I think it's about ninety percent fat. Saturated. And because of that. High such a reach and that is why it is solid at room temperature. So to summarize. In this knowledge clip. I talked about fatty acid composition. I made the fission between four different groups. Because these groups have different fatty acids compositions we talk about to the fats in animals we talk about milk fat fish oils and fetched of all oils. And then after that we talked about to try kill quest right to compensation. That it's also very important to know not only what fatty acids are present and the lipitor. But also house to try to kill glass right composition.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip is to introduction to lip pits. We have different sources to flip it. You have for example milk. Of which we make butter. And there are also. Animal sources other. Like fish and steaks or. Beef or pork. All kind of animal sources. And then you have to vegetable sources for fruits and nuts. Think of for example of a cow those. That the fruity part contains a lot of fat or peanuts or. Here you see sunflower seeds. They are all use us raw materials to get fat from. Now here you have a table in which the fat content or deliberate content of different sources. Are shown. For example cocoa beans. Of which chocolate later is made. Contains about fifty percent fat. Also peanuts contain about fifty percent of fat. Soybeans. Have a little bit less fat only twenty percent. But it's a big source of raw materials. Where oil is made from. Then all of contain about ten percent fat. And that is where we make all of our oil from meats depending on whether you have maybe a very lean fish. Of about. Only one percent a fad or we talk about a very good steak which has about. Maybe thirty percent of fat. And then to source milk. Can contain the pending on the sores between three point five and eight percent of fat. For example goat milk has not that much fat but. Water buffalo milk. Has a lot of fat and that is why. Goodman sort of was made of milk from. Water buffalo. And then x. can contain about ten percent fat. And it's all. Consistent in the you'll of the eggs and also this contains the cholesterol. That is part of the fat. The leftists have about three different functions in our food. The first function i want to talk about is to talk shit out of can give to food. Think of the maybe nice hair that you see that the text. Of the me and i is just maybe because of the fact that as in the me a nice. It also gives of course a lot of nutrition it has a high energy value. And it can contains all kinds of antioxidants and then think of the flavors. That can be part of the lippitt. Flavor compounds are dissolved in the fats and or. Are made maybe because of oxidation that can take place in the fat. All kind of flavor compounds can be formed. Also think of the creaminess that. That fat can give few in your mouth. Now to exemplify does a little bit more i want to show you the butter. As an example. Here you see the solid bus or. It's solid because of the fat. Molecules that are in here are in a crystal form. And that gives the texture to it about turn by for heat up the butter. Then it loses to structure. And then it separates out. You get to the fact content on top and the water parts. Containing a little bit of proteins. Below it. So that the butter knol lost its effect sure. Because of heating it not also you all know dad of course but there has a high nutrition content it has a lot of energy and also the butter aroma you maybe remember. You know about. Butter aroma that butter has this nice aroma not use aroma compounds are formed. Because of the fat molecules that are in there. And fermentation of the butter and that gives the aroma compounds. I was hard to give a definition of flip it's what is now lift it's exactly. There is actually not one. Leading definition. And most of the time the definition of limits is given by just naming all the compounds that are present in lives in general you could say it's a broad range of compounds. And these compounds are solvable in organic solvents. Not soluble in water. But are solvable in organic solvents made most of these compounds. I hear you see two examples. These. These two compounds are lifted compounds. And they're not the solving water because of the long carbon hydrogen chains that these two molecules have. Which makes them very. non-polar so not the sole thing in the pole are water. Altered definitions that people talk about when you talk about lip it is making the difference between a fats and an oil. If we talk about fat. Than in general we call that when it's absolute. State. At room temperature. For example here the large is solid at room temperature or an oil. Than it's liquid at from temperature for example here you see a sunflower oil. And it's clearly liquid. At room temperature. I hear you have all kind of classes. Of compounds that are present can be present in limits. Maybe. You know about fatty acids it's an important component in lippitt and most of the fatty acids here you have an example lake acid. Most fatty acids are present as an with an ask for bond. In a kilt glycerol us. And the main kill glycerol as in fat is to try to kill that sorrel. And you see an example here so three fatty acids are connected to a glycerol. Also forceful lippitt. Fatty acid but also a fuss for group. And other compounds to. Smaller compounds present in fat arse. Cyril's think of a campus sorrel which is present in plant material or glass troll that is present in animal or. Humans than all kinds of other compounds. For example. Groats annoyed skin color. To fad like the yellow butter is because of the coral to know it's present in the butter or glora feel it's a green compound. That gets for example to green color to all of oil. Now you've looked at different structures that are present in lippitt. And here i show you again. A few structures. And i have a question to you. Which of these structures. Is not a lipitor compound. Now if you took a real good look. Then you see all those long. Carbon hydrogen chains here you see to carbon hydrogen chain and here. So these are the long pole are changed. And these will not dissolve these compounds will. Because of that not the self and water. I hear is one component that is a little different you see more age groups or adams. And that makes that this compound here is much less non-polar and. It will. Maybe dissolve. Better in water. And because of that we do don't do not cold this olympic compound. We call in this case it's a flavonoid and. It's a phenolic compound. So to summarize. To slip it's to you. I talked about a different source where we've got a lip that's from animal sources and plant sources. I talked about the function of flipping some food it can get. Texture to food nutrition and. Of course flavor. It has a broad range of compounds all kind of compounds. But most lipitor compounds are a little inorganic cellphones.",

                "text": "Oh this is the next clip. In a series about simple regression. And this time. It's about. Detest have to map. Of simple regression and. You can say that. Last time we discussed the f. test. And this time we're going to discuss. A competing test. The t. test. And there are still two clips. To go. Again we'll use the lean meat percentage data yet they will be familiar to you. We want to predict. The lean meat percentage. Y. of a carcass from the fet that measurement. X.. And we have ten carcasses. In the dataset. Here we have some output you have seen before. Because in this. Output there r.d. estimates. Forty. Intercept to be to zero. And the slope. Be tell one. And we're interested in the test for the knowledgeable to see is that the slope. Is zero. First is the alternative that it is not the same situation as for the f. test actually. The outcome of the t. test is over here. The t.v. l.-u.. Is actually. Always calculated. In the same way. It's the. Estimate in this case the estimate for b. to one minus the value from an all hypothesis which is zero in this case. Divided by the standard error you can read it from the output stand of the arabs point zero eight four five one. The outcome. Is referred to a t. distribution and the degrees of freedom. Is equal to eight. In this case. It is always the degrees of freedom. Corresponding to the sum of squares. Of error. And again. That's the leeway we have for estimation. Of sigma. Epsilon square. Now the p. value can be found in the output as well. It's very small. Point zero zero zero zero one two four. So we have the same. As before with the f. test. The outcome is so rare that we don't believe it or not hypothesis. We reject it. We conclude that we have shown that the slope. Is different from zero. Incidentally the t. test. Is due to william c. lee gossett. He published under the name. Student. And he worked together with fisher. Here's an exercise for you suppose that we want to test whether the slope is minus one. Rather than zero. We can calculate the t.v. all you again. But this time we want suspects to subtract zero. We subtract. Minus one of the best that is that is two point three two. We have the same t. distribution again. You see a picture. Which will help you to determine the value of the p. value. Now. Plates determine this be value. And give your conclusion. When the size of the test this point al five. You can stop. The clip. Now. And proceed. When you're happy with your answer. Oh. This is the answer. The p. value is four point zero four nine. It's actually be a low point all five. So we conclude that the null hypothesis. Has to be rejected. And that we have shown that b. to one is not equal to minus one. Actually if you had the wrong answer. You could have had a point zero two four five for instance you're excused. But. Refresh your mind then. About one and two sided. Alternative hypothesis and one and two sided. P. values. In this case. We reject the null hypothesis. When the outcome for t. is too large. But also. When it is too small and that means that we have to add together. The area to the right. Of the outcome. Two point three two. Plus the area to the left of. Minus two point three two. And that doubles the value of. Point zero two four five. Now we have seen that the p. value for the f. and t. test is the same for the two sided alternative. Be to one. An equal zero. Actually the f. that they stick. Which is from the an over table. Is equal to the t.. Statistic. Squared. And at least that is the case taken from a table with estimated. Values from least squares. So you don't have to rock your brain. To decide whether to use the f. or to t. test. It doesn't matter. However it does matter. When you have a one sided. Alternative hypothesis. It could be. For biological reasons. That slope. B. to one positive. Is not possible. In that case the alternative would be be the one. Negative. And you need to use the t. test then. That's because a negative. Estimate for the slope. Would support the alternative hypothesis. And they could have estimate for the slope means. A negative value for t.. But the f.. Is the square of t.. So the minus sign would be lost. And we couldn't decide from. F.. Whether the data. Support. The alternative hypothesis. Or not you can also perform a t. test for the intercept. It's in the same table we looked at before. The detail you is huge and a p. value. Is very very small. This is actually a test to check whether the intercept. Is zero or not it is sometimes of interest. To check whether the line passes through the region or not but often it is not in this case. This is a test. That is hardly relevant for the lean meat percentage day. But it is there. In summary. The general form of the teat best. Is like this. And the degrees of freedom for the deed is to be used in that you need to use. Are always the degrees of freedom from the sum of squares for error. For a two sided alternative hypothesis. Be the one. An equal zero. You can use either the f. or the t. test. And the. F. that the stick is the square. Of to date is this statistic. For a one sided alternative hypothesis. Like be the one. Negative. The t. test. Should be used. Thanks for your attention. And i hope to see you back in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this session. It's part of his series. About linear regression. Simple linear regression. And we're going to talk about the f. test. First let me show you where we are in the grand scheme of things. We started off with the model. And then. In the next clip. We discussed at least gress estimation. And now we're going to talk about the. F. test and you know if a table. The next clip will be about the t.t.s. so we'll have two clips about testing. In succession. Well used to lean meat. Percentage date again. Where we had ten carcasses for each carcass. We measured. The response. Sorry. Why of a pig carcass. And the fed that measurement. X. and. We want to predict. Billy meat percentage y. from the fed dept. X.. This is the an alpha title. Or at least. This is how it looks like. In our and. In this table. Actually. Over here. We have the f. test. The f. test is a test to see whether variable x.. Has any predictive value for variable y. more formally. It is a test to see whether the slope of x. feet of one is different from zero or not. But before we get into the details. We need to discuss the ingredients. Of the you know for table first. n.d.l. for table. There are three. Sums of squares. There are actually connected. To different thoughts. Of the simple regression model. On the left connected to the response why is the total sum of squares. In the middle. Connected to the systematic part of the model. And more particularly the part about x.. Is to requestion. Sum of squares and two to write. Connected to the random part of the model. Is the ever. Or residual. Sum of squares. We're going to discuss these sums of squares. One by one. And will do. The total sum of squares first. This is the variation in why. A rounded sample mean. Totally ignoring. Variable x.. So we subtract the sample mean. From each observation. We squared and. We add the squares. Together in our. The result is one hundred sixty point four four five connected to the total sum of squares. Are a number of degrees of freedom. Nine. In this case. And more generally. And minus one where n. is the sample size. Now what about these degrees of freedom. We have used ten. Differences. To make up. The total sum of squares. But since they are differences with the mean. They add up to zero. So only nine. Can be freely chosen. That's why we have nine degrees of freedom. When we divide. The total sum of squares by its degrees of freedom. We get the usual sample. Estimate or. For the ferry and of y.. Again ignoring. X.. The outcome in this case. Is seventeen point eight three. Now in the table. The an over table. You can see that the total sum of squares. One hundred sixty point four four five. Is split into two parts one part. Is the regression sum of squares. Connected to the systematic part of the model. The other part is the. Ever sum of squares. Connected to the rhythm part of the model. And now it's clear. Why it's called. Analysis of variance. Because we decompose the total variance in y. into two sources. This is the metric and of n. the part of the model. The other sum of squares is familiar. This is the sum of squared distances. To the line. That we obtained by applying. Least squares. And when we divide by the number of the grease of freedom. We get the mean square. For error. In this case. Thirteen point. For for the fight at by eight the result. One point six three. Is actually an estimate for sigma epsilon square. The variance. Around the line. Now have a look at this picture over here on the left. We have a white red arrow. Indicating the variation and y.. Ignoring x. this is connected to the total sum of squares. In the picture. We have to green arrows. Indicating federation. Around a line. Connected to the error. Sum of squares. You can see that the red variation. Is considerably smaller than the variation. The green variation in the red fetish. This is because part of the variation in y. is explained by x.. And the explained part is the difference between the total sum of squares. And the error sum of squares. Out of them forty seven point four zero one. There's only a single degree of freedom. Connected to this. Regression sum of squares. I'll explain in a moment why. So to mean square for aggression. The rights of the sum of squares for aggression. And its degrees of freedom. Is one hundred forty seven point four zero one two. Why do single degrees of freedom. Well. Again. The degree of freedom. Is the leeway for variation. This time. Explained by x.. And it's only through. But imo to be the one. That's the only link between why an x b two one is important when b. to one is zero for instance. We have a horizontal line. X. does not explain. Any variation in y. the intercept. Is estimated by the sample mean why bar. The regression sum of squares is zero. The total sum of squares is the ever sum of script so since only one parameter is involved. We have a single degree of freedom. Now here you have the you know if a table again and this time. Most of the ingredients will be familiar. And here we have the f l u. It's actually the rates yo of the mean square foot aggression. And a means for error. A lot would indicate that. X. has predictive value for y. because it indicates that the regression. Sum of squares is more important than the ever. Sum of squares. More formally. The f.. Is a test that they stick for the novel hypothesis that slope b. to one is zero. First is the alternative. That it is not. Now in order to perform the test. We need to p. fell. It's the probability. Under eight zero. For the outcome. Ninety point four and. Anything larger than that larger. Because large values of f. support. The alternative hypothesis. When to be value is small it indicates that the outcome. Is actually to lauch. To support. The knowledgeable to says. We were rejected. Too small in statistics means. Generally that the people you. Is below zero point five point two five. Alpha. It is usually called is the size of the test. Or the significance level. You can use. Lower values for instance in medical research as well. But point zero five is a common choice. To calculate the p. value. And to see whether it's below zero point zero five. We need. The distribution of. S. under the novel to says that distribution. Is an f. distribution. It has two numbers for its degrees of freedom. The f. one. And the of two the if one is one in this case. Because the if one is always the number of parameters. Involved in an ally poultices. In this case only b. don't want. Eight. In this case. For the of two. Is actually the number of degrees of freedom from the sum of squares of error. That's always the case with the f. test. So the if two is always degrees of freedom. Of the s s e. And incidentally. The f. does this cold. After several. Elmore fischer. He was a statistical genius. There's a lot in statistics. That is due to him. Right. In summary. You know for table. Comprises. Three sums of squares. A total sum of squares. A regression sum of squares. And it ever sum of scripts that correspond to different parts of the model. The f. that this stick is derives from the mean squares for aggression. And error. It can be used to test whether. Excess predictive value. That is whether the slope. Be the one. Is zero or not and to calculate the p. value. We use the f. distribution. Right. Thanks for your attention. And see you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this clip. About least squares estimation this clip actually follows up on the previous clip. About simple regression. If you haven't looked at that clip yet. Please do so first. In that clip. We introduced this dataset. We have lean meat percentages why a long deferred to collect says. We have fed debts x.. Along the horizontal axis. They are corresponding to carcasses of pigs. And we have ten picks. In the plot. We want to predict y. from x.. And in order to do so. We want to fit a line through the points. First of all. We draw a line. Just any line. By i. We want to quantify how well this line. Fits. The points. In order to do so. It makes sense. To look at the distances. Of each point. To the line of at distances. Ten of them are indicated here. We need a quality criterion for the fit of the line. That will depend on these distances. And one option is to take their sum is that a good idea. Well actually it is not. If you look at the line over here. The horizontal red line. And the six dots. You will see that. The distances of the blue dots. Above the line which are positive. Cancel. With the distances. Of the blue dots. Below the line. Which are negative. So some of the distances is actually zero. It suggests a nice fit. But the fit. Is actually quite poor. So somehow. We have to remove the minus signs. For distances. The obvious way to do so is to take the sum of. Absolute values of distances. By debt is rather awkward. To handle. Mathematically. And long time ago. A very long time ago. A number of. People. Among them. Karl friedrich gauss. Decided that we should minimize the sum of squared distances. So in order to estimate the line. We look at the sum of squared distances. And we take that line. Where that sum is minimized. That's. The method of least queers estimation. Here you have an exercise. It's just a small one. We have three observations. The diamonds in the plot. And three. Possible lines. You can see the intercepts. The ciro and slopes. Be to one of the lines below to plot. Get are some calculations. Just let me show you briefly. This prediction. Over here. Three point seven. Is obtained by looking at the red line. Where you take the intercept one. And you. At the slope. Point nine times the value of x.. Which is three. You can fill out all the other predictions. Yourself. If you want a distance. Like this one point three over here. It's actually the difference between the observation four and a fitted value or prediction. Three point seven we just calculated. So in a moment. I'm going to ask you to stop this video. And to check these calculations. If you do so. You will see that the winning line is the red one. With a value for the sum of squares of distances. Of one point seven nine. It is the best of the three lines. But. Is it the best of all lines. So please stop the video now. And check these calculations. To see whether you have understood. The principle of least queers elo again a little piece of mathematics. How do we find the best fit in line. The sum of squares of distances. Is actually a function of the unknown intercept be this hero. And slow be the one. We can take the river to fs and equate to. Zero. That will result in two. Linear equations with two. I know it's this set of equations. It's called. The set of normal. Equations. So least squares estimates are solved from this head of normal equations. If you don't like mathematics a lot. Don't worry. Art. Can do this for you. Gladly within the blink of an eye. Here you have some output of are you going to ignore most of what you see at the moment. But here. We have the value of the intercept. Sixty eight point three four. And the slope. Minus zero point eight. Estimated forty best line. By our for you. To summarize briefly. In this plot. You see. An estimated line. The blue line. You see a value x. i four. Variable x.. And a corresponding value why i would response. And a black dot. Is an observation. The blue dot. Is the corresponding point on the line. It's called. The predicted. Or fitted fell you noted by why had i it's a point on the line. It's also an estimate for the population mean. The population mean. Of all units that share the same value x. y. for x.. So the blue dot. At the same time. Is a prediction for a new y. and an estimate for the population and you also see differences in ret. Between hopes of facials and predicted values they are called residuals residuals the noted by the i. It is the difference between an observation. And a prediction. It's also an estimate for the error to an epsilon. In the statistical model for linear regression. Now. We're seeing how to get. Estimates for b. to zero and be the one. How about the variance. Sigma square. Epsilon. Of the era terms. Epsilon. In the model. If these epsilons were known. There are ten of them. The obvious estimate for the variance would be the sum of their squares. Divided by ten. Please note that we don't need to subtract the mean of the epsilons because we already know that the mean of the epsilons is zero. Now we don't know the epsilons. So we use. The residuals. Estimates for the epsilons. Instead. Also we don't divide by ten. Because for technical reasons. You have to subtract two. In order to account for the fact that lead to zero and b. to one. Are estimated from the data that will give. This will give you an on biased. Estimate or. So. The estimate that is the sum of squared residuals. They find that by eight. How does it look in general. The sum of squares of residuals. Is actually decided as the sum of squares. Distances. We talked about before. Now. To define a line. That was fitted by least squares. We call this sum the sum of squares of error or. Sometimes the residual sum of squares. Eight. In general actually. Is the number of observations and. Produced by two. So. The estimate for the residual variance. Is the sum of squares for error the five at by and minus two. Which in turn is called. The mean square for error or. Residual here you have the output from our again. Our. Won't give you an estimate for sigma epsilon square here. It gives you an estimate for sigma epsilon. The residual. Or eric standard definition. It's actually one point two seven seven. If you want to know the variance. Just take the square. And you get one point six three. In summary. Least presents to my shoe means that you choose the values. For intercept b. to zero and stop either one. That. If you. The smallest sum of square distances. Off. The observations. The points in the plot to fit that line. This smallest sum of squares. Is called. The sum of squares for error as as easy or. Also called. The residual sum of squares. Or sum of squares for residual. We have predicted. Or fitted values. The points on the line. We have residuals. The estimates for the average to us the variance. Is estimated by the sum of squares for ever be fired at by and minus two. Which is also called the mean square. For error or mean squared for is it to thanks for your attention.

                "text": "Hello welcome to this clip. About simple regression. Simple regression. Is about the relationship between two variables. One of the variables. Is the response variable the ferryboat of interest. Traditionally called y. the other variable. Is variable x.. The explanatory variable. And we want to know. Given the value of x.. What faile use y. possibly can take i'll give you an example. In all the slaughterhouses. Throughout the european community. Believe me percentage of a carcass is predicted. It is predicted. Because an accurate. Calculation of the lean meat percentage means that the carcass. Has to be desexed in lean meat and bone. That's a destructive process. And it reduces to the value of the carcass considerably. So we prefer to predict. The lean meat percentage for payment. To the farmer. The variable that is used for prediction. Is defect depth of the carcass. At the particular position in the picture. You can see how it's done with a pro. So. X. is fed that y. is lean the percentage the value of the fed depth is known. But for any given value of x.. The value of the lean meat percentage wise may vary so response y. is a random variable. And has a distribution here if you have a small data set. To fit the slide. Of ten carcasses. Are only a long deferred to collect says. You have to lean meat percentage. Along the horizontal axis. You will see the fed depth. There are ten points for ten carcasses. I hope you agree that the points. Are roughly on a straight line. The strike line might look like this with sixty eight point three. As the. Sept and minus point eight. As the slope. The intercept is actually to fell you for y. when x. is zero. And the slope. Of minus point eight means. That with any increase of one millimeter fet depth. The lean meat percentage is expected to decrease by minus point out. You will wonder where the number sixty eight point three. And minus point eight. Are from. I will tell you in the next clip. Meanwhile except this formula. If you do so for any new carcass. For instance. A caucus with fifteen millimeters fed depth. You can predict. The lean meat percentage. Without distraction. The prediction is fifty six point three percent. And it can be used for payment. To the farmer. Now. In order to turn this into a respectable. Statistical problem. And as a step up to the next clip where we going to estimate the intercept and the slope. We need a statistical model. Is that this tickle model. Is just a set of equations. That describes how to date or. Are supposed to be generated. To start with imagine that we take this up population. Of all carcasses. With the same set that the. X. for instance. Fifty millimeters. Suppose that you could determine the lean meat percentage of each carcass you cannot of course but. Just suppose. In that case we could take the mean. Of all the lean meat percentages. And we'll assume. On the basis of our plot. That the mean. Looks like this and intersect. B. to zero plus a slope. B. to one times. The explanatory ferryboat. X.. Since neither be to zero or b. to one are known. The numbers. I showed you before. Were just estimates. Will introduce these unknown. Parameters. Because hero. And be the one in the model. Any individual ups or fed. Differs from the mean by. Absalom. Absalom is the departure from the mean. For any individual carcass. So if you have a number of carcasses. With the same fed there. Ex. They will not have the same values for why. There is variation due to the absolutes. The epsilons. Are representing. Biological variation in the data. Here you have a picture. In the picture. You will see a carcass. Over here. With fifteen meters fat that. For that carcass. We can look at the point. On the line that's the blue dot. That's the mean. Of all carcasses. With fifteen. Meeting with the fed that's the mean for the lean meat percentage. It's also our prediction. We just calculated to value for intercept sixty eight point three. And slope minus point eight. It's fifty six point three. The red dot is an individual carcass. It differs from the mean the difference is. Epsilon. Which is in this case. Equal to three and a half. So the observation. Is fifty six point three. Plus the departure of three and a half. Which makes fifty nine point eight. The fifty nine point eight. Is just one value. From a distribution of values. As indicated in the plot. So if we look at more. Carcasses with the same fed ex you will see more of the red thoughts around to pollute thought. Appearing. Now the epsilons. Are differences with respect to the mean. The mean. Of the lean meat percentage of all carcasses with the same fell you effect that. X.. So the epsilons will vary. Around zero. They will have a particular. Variance. The epsilons. Are actually called error terms. Will assume that the distribution of the epsilons. Is a normal distribution. The variance. Sigma epsilon square is important. Because it tells us about the quality of prediction that we can expect. For instance. If we have small variance. Meaning that yep sloan's. Are small the points the observations will be close. Around the line. Predictions the points on the line. And the observations. Will be close together. But dictions will be goot. But when the variances lauch meaning. Large epsilons. Large departures. The points will scatter. Widely. Around the line. And differences between predictions and observations maybe lauch prediction will be poor. So it's not only important. To estimate the intercept be to zero and slope b. to one from the data. We also need an estimate for the ferry and sigma square. Epsilon. To know how well. Prediction will work. In summary. We have for the. I think. Experimental unit. Why i mean. The blue part b. to zero plus b. to one x. i.i. plus event in the potsherd. The green part. Absalom i bottle assumptions for systematic thought. The blue part where your shoe. At the mean. Depends. Linearly. Up on the explanatory variable x.. For the epsilons. Random part. We have normality. Equal ferry ends and independence. A little bit more about the independence. Actually you don't need to take a venom sample of carcasses. For instance. It's enough to select the caucuses. On x.. You're allowed to do so. But at any time that you list select a caucus for instance with fifty meters fed dept. Death caucus. Has to be a venom sample from all caucuses with fifty meeting needs fit that that's what the independence. Is about. Finally. This is called simple regression. Because that is also. Multiple regression. In simple regression. We relate. Our. Why. To one variable x.. In multiple regression. We have several x. variables. One can be to fed depth. For instance. The other one could be. The thickness of the muscle. Underneath. Both determined by the prob. Ok. Thank you for your attention. And see you in the next clip.\n",

                "text": "Welcome to this knowledge clip but i will explain. The classification of proteins. For food chemistry. The classification. Is mostly based on the searcher and the so you ability of proteins. This is because the structure. Affects the fix an entity of the podiums. For instance the so you build it in. And the solubility is used as a classification because he determines a lot of. The applications of proteins. It is important for posting links. For coffee creamer for instance. And in soups and sources. It is also a very important parameter. If you look to the. Classes of proteins that exist in the world. We see different types of thirty years coming back. And these types of structures are used to classify. Based on the structure. So the. One of the most important classes is the global of postings. Global or podiums are called global zero because it take a very compact shape. Where all the parts of the molecule are linked together. In contrast to these proteins we also have similar podiums where the sequence of the posting is very extended and. In this picture of the fable opposing my use in which is for muscle tissue. You can already see that in the film the protein you don't have one. But i had chain that say to need this is he tickles thirty. Of two podiums. Linked together. Not called fade empty but none called fame and healing together. In addition there is a class of venom coil proteins gay scenes are one of the most important classes of phantom called proteins. The boredom is. I want to show you a picture of a condom called poti. But actually by definition i had them call poting. Does not have any fixed. Structure. In time. So even though you see a shape. In time. This is very mobile. And this will change. While the structure of the fibula proteins and the global a potence is constant in time. In addition to these three classes we also have a class called. Well. All the podiums. And these are podiums that are typically very insoluble. They are present in made thesis. That can be different types of bits one of the more important ones. Is gluten and to show you what gluten are i can show you was thirty year. Because these proteins tend to be course linked together. Sue deisel five bitches for instance. And deford very insoluble. So if you take flour and you wash out. The starch in the end to get this type of good mr chair which is the root and proteins. The difference between the classes. Is mostly on the failure ability. Typically. Global or podiums or current. For instance in bloodstream. In milk in soybeans as well. In the style mouth sells. And then these. Surroundings the property of the global potency is normally two ten sports or two gave the taishan. For these things and that it these. You have to be soluble so potent in the bloodstream have to be soluble. And therefore. Typically global proteins tend to be soluble. In contrast to days fibula proteins are used to muscle tissue. They should not be dissolved. Of course. In the presence of blood. Then i'm quite a polity and are very soluble. Typically they have a fairly good association was water but they also tend to make myself. But still there are global one. As i mentioned the other proteins such as gluten. Are not soluble. That is besides the classification of. Also a classification with names. Depending on the say ability. And this is shown in this light. It started with all sporran who in the development of protein that he said stupefied he leaving a hole and developed a systematic approach. On the isolation of proteins. And he started with. Insoluble material. Wheat flour which was one of the first podium sources that it. And if you take wheat flour you mix it with water. Part of the potency of the wheat flour are to extract it in the soup in a tent. And these we called the album ins. If you take this material and you. Centrifuge. You got that message you. Which still contains files of the proteins. And if you. Dissolve this. Of his suspended in a sodium chloride solution. Typically in the last one particle five percent. You expect a lot of part of the proteins which on the global ends more salt soluble. Proteins are still in the residue that this. Left. You still have proteins and part of these proteins you can extract with ethanol. Seventeen percent. And these are called palm ins. And that has a jewel of the podiums that still is not soluble. Even in seventy percent ethanol. Is called the gluten ins and for wheat. These two last factions are actually very important because these are the gluten. And as you may know many people are allergic to gluten. So this is exactly defection of the proteins that cause us that it is important to the allies the dish losses of proteins our classes. So that is not an album in beat flower and that has not won the global in. But they can be many different. Album and. Expected at the same time. With all these. Elba and proteins. Shanda popa t. that. They are dissolved in water in. Addition to this name giving of proteins based on the extracted belittle from wheat flour. So starting from an insoluble material. We also have a similar name. But for different types of sources basically. Soluble sources. So for instance if you start for milk. We have a solution where all the podiums and this old. Francis in way podiums. Then if it changes the solvent conditions by adding ammonium self-hate which his. Salting. Out. Solution. If you use fifty percent. Ammonium still fades we precipitated part of the. Podiums. We called this the. But because if it ate at bats we call global names. But part of the material still stays in solution so this is present in the soup in a tent. And if you increase across at ation of among a small fade more of the podiums from the milk from the way are dated. And this is a locked album in for instance. Is an example. And the group. As a total is called the album ins. So the elements is this case again are the best soluble. Podiums with the highest solubility. They have very difficult to precipitate. So in both methods we make a distinction between very soluble proteins album ins. Global ends which are slightly less valuable. They precipitate. Easier or they need to some soul to be expected. And the remaining part of things. We see these. To my knowledge he. Coming back in a name so for milk we isolate for instance of a locked album in. So an album and that's unlocked so global in solar global and posey. And the first part of the name is the source. So locked all for milk. Of all for x.. Meo for muscle. And see it him for blood. After this short non-descript i have a question for you. If you know. And can explain me. Why. The solvents. Are used in the wheat flour extraction. That i mentioned. So what is the value of using butter sodium chloride. And ethanol as a solvent. If you think about the extraction methods. Water is a good solvent for water soluble compounds. What happens if i increase i on next things. Is that i get salting in. And the salting in of poting depends on the salvation of the eye only groups the chance corpse of the posy. So our local sedations. Of salt. Actually did. I only coupes the chance copes of the protein are more soul faded. And therefore have a better interaction with. This solution. And therefore becomes valuable. As a whole is an organic solvent so it is slightly harder for dick. And actually it helps hydrophobic hooves of the podium to interact better with the. Solvent. And in the end. This means that the more able no proteins can also be dissolved in symmetry. The classification of podiums we have. Classification based on the structure. We have a classification basis for your ability or. Actually the insolubility of proteins in the different conditions. And this classification. Is reflected by the names of the proteins.",

                "text": "Welcome to this not us clip i will explain to you. This torture. About. Of proteins and how distorted is developed. And how it is influencing the properties of proteins. Aloof indication of the structure. Complex structure of proteins is in the state in the picture on the left. Why do we care about the structure of proteins. Well the structure of proteins is extremely important for the properties of the proteins. So it is important for the for you ability of proteins. But also for all the foam. Forming properties. Gel forming poverty's an education. And the example for instance is the boarding off act where opposing both from the natives thirty here. And that you have a liquid x. y.. To unfold the search and you get education and you had to get a hard boiled egg. At the same time. Now this is an excellent pull of the effect of temperature. At the same time gelatin. Is dissolved by heating it in a water solution. If you cooled down you get the gel. But if you want to jam it in again you get again the solution. So for gelatin the gel formation. Is who first of all. And this depends on the structures of the proteins. In addition to temperature. Destructor is affected by the ph and i all mix things. Because they influence the charge. It is influenced by the solvent conditions. And as i mentioned it changes the properties of the proteins. The first level of structure of a protein. We called the prime of these thirty of the protein. Is a sequence of the in my know as it's in the. But tightening. So poting is supposedly peptides build up of mine as it's the sequence of the amana as it's only the prime of his stature. But if the peptide saying this long enough you get that it is thirty and august total elements. This is explained in the next. Right. After the primaries torture we have to second the research elements which are. The way in which the prime minister tour. Is shaped in space. That different types of second the research i meant. And one of the most important ones is the alpha helix. Shown here in the alpha helix the peptide chain. Is shaped. In a unique whole structure in the heater core searcher and actually the spheres. Are the side that has the juice of the different than mine acids. And as you can see the side less a juice on the outside of the helix. So the inside of the helix is anti the residues on the outside. This thirteen of the alpha helix is stabilized by hydrogen bombs. Between here. The dotted line between the nitrogen. Of one. But mon. Alpha a minute group and. The public cynical. Of another black man. In addition to the alpha helix. The other main element is be thought she'd be the ship's gun or go on their own. They are quite flat and extended. So in contrast to the alpha helix which has more of them stay and see them mention all the meters she this quite flat. Depending on the equivalence of multiple beater sheets we does. Distinguish and he bet a little bit as sheets. So these are sections of the the sheets that are stacked. Quite close to each other if they are in the opposite direction as shown here in the picture. We call it. And the parallel. We get a kind of. States or the ordering of the beads or sheets. Or the maybe n.c. parallel. Then. It's a little bit. Off so weak i can see a slight difference in the structure of the beat the sheets depending if it's part. Or and they better now. And this is the germans again. In the same way as the alpha helix by the. Hydrogen bombs. The tween. The stands. So in the alpha helix. The hydrogen bombs are within the helix. Was in one second a historic moment for the be that he eats this hydrogen bonding between different beat i.c.'s this explains how the sake of primaries. Structure is shaped in space. But in a protein i can have different alpha he needs his and different beat us sheets. And they are ordered together in space as well. And this ordering in space. We called the tree structure and. This is a typical example of how you see potency presented. So we see the different secondary search elements. We see the alpha he makes and hat. And different types of b. the sheets that. Parallel and to parallel. In the yellow. In between you see small parts of the polity that are white and not specifically shaped and these we call the random. Coil at a house. So those are the parts of the climate is thirty that don't have a secondary structure. But as you can see in this podium. The alpha he leases are oriented specifically to us each order. As a function of time. And this fixed. Structure in space and time is called the researcher. An alternative way to look at a protein is a space filling model. So here all the atoms. Have that papa. Size and shape. And then you can see that. Actually the folding of the posting. So the thirty is thirty or element. As an s. and his hilt. That that is a very condensed shape. Of the of the protein molecule it's not as open as you might think. Based on the first picture. In addition. I've called out here at the charter school. The negatively john scopes in blue. The positively charged hoops and that's because he that they are mostly present on the other side of the molecule. So the folding. The teacher folding has has an effect that the hydrophobic among the assets here him white. Are actually mostly on the inside of the podium and shielded from the solvent. Only deponent the grey. And the charged. The blue and that's a minor as it's a mostly. Present on the outside of the molecule from the face fitting model you might think that the protein. Is fairly solid. This is possibly too but if you look in and the maastricht yes. We can actually see the variation of the structure as a function of time. Fairly fast pose as us. So if i look two opposing in solution. You can see here for instance that this part of the dunham coil loop. Is moving as a function in time. Even though this be that it is not moving in. Time summit. So boss of the protein. Are quite fixed. A part of the posen are quite flexible. The stitches structure of the protein is stabilize the. Electrostatic interactions between the groups of the same poting. So you can see here a positive and the negatively charged school together. They can have attacked of interaction. Hydrophobic interactions between one hundred four become on assets that are close at on the inside of the posting. And then. We have the deisel five bitches that are actually covalent bombs. A form of als interactions. In addition to this stage mr chairman which is for one public that chain. We can also have different bowl of peptide chains that together make opposing. And this is called the quarter net history of album in a posting from chicken egg white. Is a single. Rosie. Normally as a single polypeptide chain in solution with the likes of global inform re is another very important. Poti. But as you see in the picture. Actually it forms a dime or. So in solution. It is not one post the path touching. The normally two identical. Polypeptide chain clustered together to form a dime or. And this diameter is the typical structure as a door or curse in nature. And this is what we mean. With the quaternary structure. Then. For more complex proteins. Such as. Soit this is. We have differences in its that are called faith in the being in the city. And a basic soup unit here. The wide. And that have parts are the. Acidic and basics of unit. These are all headed to pour new peptide chains. There i'm going to call fame and the bio deisel fide bitch. And then c r six actually of these clusters. Are closely in to get us through nongovernment interactions. To form a hex so much. So this quite analogous searcher is described or stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions mostly done destabilised by dice for five balls between the different body parts i change about the challenge and. In the terminology. We talk about the confirmation of opposing. And changes in the confirmation of the protein. And then we refer to a combination of the second largest search elements to his thirty. Elements and a quite an at least a year. So the. Association state of the protein. Just to review were done to force us to stabilize the protein structure. I've mentioned them before but here i show. In pictures. Schematically where the forces come form. So we have cold feet and small arms. That can stabilize protein structure and this had. I saw five bombs covalent means that they shared in that lets on. So there is a deal. Boards between the two silver groups either gen bombs. Which is a non-confidence bomb and most of the other. Interactions are known coffin and interaction so no chemical bombs. But we have hydrophobic interactions between a polar side chain and us a juice. So the ever magic and the fed take a minor as it's an indian nation we have electrostatic interactions. But these can be attacked. If people's if. Again depending on the groups and the ph. So in somebody. If you see these interactions. It is important to realize how they are influenced by the system conditions. So the presence of a heat using agent. Which can break. The deisel fed which is the temperature. Which can affect the hydrogen bombs. The solvent conditions. To change the hydrophobic interactions between molecules. And the ph and i said let's take points of opposing. And the groups in opposing. Can determine the things. Of electrostatic interactions. At the end of this enormous clip. The question that i want you to answer is a how the p. eight. Affects the structure of a protein. If you consider the forces that stabilize the proteins thirty year and the effects of ph. You will realize that. Around the i selected point of the poty. The total net yards of the hooves. On the podium surface. Is see it out. So i have an equal number of positive and negative charges on the protein surface. This means that they can actually have positive. With negative have an effective interaction. And this results in a very stable and global or folder to context search of the protein molecule. What happens if i change the ph away from the i. Three point i go above or below do i select think point x. in the. I see that the is an excess of. Negative chances or an excess of positive charges. Because then the total charge is not zero but it has a sign it's either positive or negative. These calls will be charter and this will lead to a swelling of the titular stricture so unfolding on the territory level. At some point. And if it's very extreme i might even see unfolding on the secondary level so i see the loss of b. the sheets and alpha he says. In summary. If you look to the structure of the proteins. It is important to here lies that. Stabilized. By different. Forces different interactions. Go for an aunt and uncle vein and. That had different structural elements to describe the protein structure. And different levels to describe the proteins thirty.",

                "text": "Time for a cup of tea. And we have that i mean. Let's have a closer look in the on the phenolic compounds present day. Tea and how they how they influenced the tea properties. So the properties of tea are determined by the end symmetrical she dating of the phenolic compound being present. And these phenolic. Compounds. Are being. Conferred it in two key knowns. These key knowns. React to die most all of them earth. And eventually into polymers. So in t. A roma is being formed by the reaction of. Key knowns. With a minor as it. Also we see the color formation of t.. And that's because of the yellow color of dime or us or the red brown color us. Of all of them with polymer us. And also these all of us they can give us. And strength and. Sensation. When we drink tea. So what kind of teas are there. Well. We have to green tea. Which is known for meant it. So after the tea leaves are being picked they are heated and then already that. The green tea. Is ready. On the other hand. And of the spectrum. We have fermented tea or black tea. The tea leaves. Are being crushed. They are dried to a certain extent. And then they are left. And then from it they should take place. The enzymes can come into contact with the phenolic compounds. Due to the crushing. And after a certain amount of time. The heating step. Is introduced in activating the enzyme. And then. We have to ferment it. Black tea. In between. We have to be where we have a short. From and take some time. And you can already see here. The difference in color. The longer different asian time. The darker the color. So what course is this dark color. Or in other words what kind of phenolic compounds in our present. Well the most abundant phenolic compounds present in tea. Flovent olds. And we also call them ketek in. And he we see the structure of get the cane. But basically we should have a more closer look at the structure. Because we have. Steerer isom is here. Here we see. The always group on the c. three position of the c. ring. It's pointed. Forward. So this is a close. Catholic in the isomer. Where the always group. Is pointed backwards. We call epic at the get the third representative of catholic ins. Is epi. Gallo get again. And what the difference here is that on the b. ring. We have an additional weights group. In comparison to epi get again or to get a king. So that's the gallo. In the name. We also have a get it in by weights the weights the c. three position. Of the searing. Is being there if it ties. Bias in them i guess a derivative. By gallic as it and. The name. Epi get again. Late. And when we have the additional away group on the b. ring present. Then we have the epoch. Gallo get again. Galle. So these are the five major representatives of get it in present in t.. Least. Here you see. The concentration of the different. Representatives. And you can see that epi get again girl eight. Is the one which is most. Mostly present. This is in green tea and if you now leak. Look at black tea. What we see is that. Overall the concentration go down. Well. That's obvious because they get akins. React. Into larger. Into. Into keno and. Which are then concerted in. Into dimas all of the mess and polymers. What kind of enzyme. Do this job. Well. In t.. We have a number of enzymes present. The first one is crystal lace. And it's a poly from the. Oxy days. And crestor lace it first. Hydroxy. Gives a hydroxy lation reaction. So it can put a no age group. On a mono substituted group because the dye hydroxy. Female. And this dye had roxy pheno. Can be oxidized into a key known. Another type of a poly from the oxy days. Is chemical lace. It cannot. Hydroxy late. Benzene. But what it can do. Once an auto. Pheno is present. It can. It can oxidize it into a keno. So these are the poly for norks a day says. Well indeed or are more enzymes present like ace and proxy days. And these enzymes they form. First a radical. And then later all. Part of this radical are being conferred it. Into keynotes. And we all know that these key knowns are important for the subsequent reaction. Taking place in t.. So from green tea. To black tea. We have the oxidative enzymes. And we have to fluff an old the catholic and convert it into keynotes. Then into dime earth. And these diamonds they have the name of t.f. levin's. Or to see in essence. And then we get all aglow meth. Well. And these. Dime or as we know the structure. But basically all these. All of them are the structures have not been identified yet. We know that they are there. But the structures. Have not been identified. So let's have a closer look at the formation of these diameters and in this case the fluff and. We have to epi kellock get the kin. And we have to educate the kin. So the two different. Two different forms of get taken and by the end times. They are going to convert it into their respective keynotes. And then these key knowns are conferred it. In a t.f. layfield and you see a fairy peculiar. Seven ring here. And c o two is being emitted here. So these are t f eleventh's the other example. Is the formation of the scene essence. We start with epic i look at think in its being concerted. Into its kino. Then it reacts with an epic goetic in late. And then here we see the scene essence get laid. So the typical. Examples of the diameters being being formed and what's so typical about these diameters is the large number of. Awaits groups. Being present. And in the case here also with the galle. We have another female ring. Present. Which makes it. Very good. Compounds to interact with proteins. So we can also see the effects of the conversion of green tea into. Into black tea. By monitoring the computer the composition of the green tea by monitoring the different representatives. At the monomaniac level and i can see here is. Gallo goetic in all the different. All the different get tickets present in tea. In green tea. And this is. h.p.l.c. betten and if we now. Analyze the black sea. And what we see. You can see here. That in black tea. All these monomers. Has disappeared. And we can see here that we have some some dimas present here in the in the black tea. Which were not present in the green tea. So we can. Closely monitor the formation of of diamonds and also the disappearance of the moment. And you can see here already. The difference in color. And this difference in color. Is even better depicted. If you take. If you measure the absorption at a different race length. Here we see the green tea. We see hardly an absorption in the wavelength. Area where we observe a brown color. And if we analyzed. The black tea. You can see the absorption of the way for length between four hundred fifty and six hundred nanometers. So the. Brown brown color. So let's rehearse now. By a question of which components. Are and foremost in the following properties of t.. He we have three properties. Browning. Aroma formation and. Astringency. Well for browning. It are key knowns and. Phenolic compounds. For aroma formation. There are key knowns and a minor as it is reacting. If each other and for astringency. These are all of them is formed. Which react with saliva proteins. To summarize. In c. especially ketek ins are present. Depending on the processing time of t.. Depending on the fermentation time of t.. We can have green tea. You can have long tea and black tea. And during this fermentation. Phenolic compounds. All of them arise. And polarize. And this all of a merry sation reaction. And also the form or formation of key knowns. Have a direct effect on the characteristics of the tea.",

                "text": "Welcome to this knowledge clip with deals with the interaction of phenolic compounds with protein eighty's materials. So what kind of interactions. Are there between phenolic compounds and protein ace's materials. And what kind of protein nations materials. We have. Well. If we go to the type of interactions. The first type of interaction. The covalent interactions. And a covalent interaction. Takes place. A key known which is being formed in a key known can react. If a free a minor as it. Which is also a protein nations material and an important effect of a reaction with a freedom i know as it is the formation of aroma. But the keynotes can also interact with proteins if they are present. And then. If they interact. It can lead to the formation of precipitates. So this is the co failand interaction. The other type of interaction. Is the norm covalent interaction. Which we also call reversible interaction. And this takes place. Hydrophobic interactions. And also by interactions builds. These kind of nongovernment interactions take soli place. With proteins. And they can form precipitates. And a specific form of a specific alpha. Of a precipitate being formed. Is when these phenolic compounds interact with selling very proteins. When so when we consume a food base contains phenolic compounds. And then. This interaction. Gives rise to a precipitates. Which we perceive as an estrangement feeling. In our mouth. Ok let's go to the covalent interaction with proteins. So what happens. We have a. We have a female. Which is being. Oxidized by by an enzyme into a key known. And then. We have an a minus the side group often a minor as it can be lice in it go. It can be sixteen. And then. A nuclear feel like a deck takes place on the kino. And then we get an edit the reaction with a free a minor as it of the kino. Is called the strike adric addition. We have a key no. We haven't a minor as it. And then. Basically the a minor group of the a minor as it is being transferred to the keen on. But was left behind. It's an elder height. So what's left behind of the a minor as it is an elder height. An elder height are full of tile. Components. And they also have an aroma. So we see that from an eye minor as it together with a key known and elder hide. Is formed in iraq. And our own compound his phone. No go fail and interactions. I already said it before because interactions are important. And also interactions for five hundred involves. If we have proteins and phenolic compounds. Also called body feels weak at complexes. And when these complexes. Become bigger. We see a haze. It is a face of all kind of suspension. In the complexes are not precipitated there. But if these complexes grow in size. At a certain moment. They become insoluble. And we call it the sediment or to precipitate these known covalent interactions between a phenolic compound and. The protein. They depends on number affect us. And first of all. It's the hydrophobic. The protein. Not eat. Its protein has the same how to for basically. It also depends on the ph. Of the system. And the interaction between the phenolic compound in a protein is maximal. Around the ice or electric point. Because at depth at the ally point. We don't have repulsion. By charge of individual protein molecules. And of course. It doesn't only. Depend on the protein. On the condition. It also depends on the correct to restrict. Of the phenolic compounds. Of so little ids phenolic compounds. And what is the degree of polymerization of the phenolic compound. So let's go to the degree of a not. Of polymerization. Of the phenolic compound and how it influences. The strength of the norm coffee and interaction. What is depicted here. Is a phenolic compound. Pheno. And a protein which only has one. Binding. Basically it means that's a very weak binding because the. Binding can be there. It's in. Reversible binding. At and in an instant later. The interaction going to go on. So it's a reviving. But if we have a number of. Number of weak bindings. Basically. It makes up a strong binding. Because the probability that. All of these bones are being broken. At the same time. Is basically neglectable. So basically then. The number of weak bindings. Together make the strong binding so that all of america form. Is very important. So i'm an american female doesn't. In doesn't the interaction of of i'm one america female doesn't give rise to a strong binding. If you have all the gomers. You have more possibilities of interaction. We have. We do have a strong binding. And this is depicted by as strained by the perception of astringency. What is the picture here in this graph. Is on the x. axis. We have the degree of polymerization. Of phenolic compounds. And on the y. axis we have the strength of s. astringency which is basically the strength of interaction with our saliva proteins. And what we can see here that with increasing. Degree of polymerization we have an increase in the astringency so the. Ingres in the strength of in the direction. Which follows. Which follows this theory that we also see that there's a certain moment. Because the decrease. While this decrease. This is caused by the molecules. Becomes so big. So the phenolic obama. They become so big if they have a d.p.. High and in seven. That they can spatially interact. Okami close contact with the protein. So this is a strength of binding. And this is more a diffusion aspect. So let's go to the interaction the saliva proteins. Saliva proteins are pro langridge. Proteins. And pro line. Residues in proteins. They have a strong tendency to interact with and all the compounds. And that is the picture here in two ways. So here we have a pro line residue. Here we have a phenolic compound. And what we can see here if you go to the to this side. We see here we have the pro-life in-ring. And we have the. The six ring of the phenolic compound. And then we have stacking. And in addition to the stacking stacking is hydrophobic interaction. We also have the hydrogen build in interaction between. The protein. Or the pro line model. Molecule. And the phenolic compound. And this makes a very strong interaction. So next to astringency. We also see the effect of protein phenolic compound interaction. On the precipice. And hateful nation in foods. Like i've mentioned before. And we can distinguish two different situations. One situations which. For example takes place in beer. Where we have a high protein. Female ratio. And the order. Situation takes place in a fruit juice. In fruits of you'll notice hardly any proteins. But there is still a lot of familiar compounds. So if you go to the situation. If high protein low for low females. So a high protein female ratio. Precipitation. Can take place. If we have multiple interaction between. The protein and. The phenolic compound and another. Protein. So the press at the precipitation. Takes place. To cross-linking. Of. Individual protein molecules. Fired to phenolic compound. Any other situation where we have a lot of females. Present. It's basically a kind of hydrophobic coating. A protein in itself a global or protein. As a hydrophilic. Surface. And if we coat it with the phenolic compound. The harder for basically increases. And the call drags has a low cell ability. And it just certain states. It will precipitate. So in both situations. We have interactions with proteins and from all the compounds. But. Via a different mechanism. This is basically. Precipitation. Because of the size of the complex. And this is precipitation. Basically because of the hydro for busy. Of the complex. Ok it's time for a question. Why does the addition of milk diminish the astringent taste of tea. Well we know that. Phenolic compounds in te form precipitates with saliva protein in the mouth. Causing this. Astringent feeling. If we now add milk and millican things protein. If you're already at the protein to duty in a cup of tea. Then all the phenolic compounds of the t. interact with the protein. So there are no phenolic compounds. Left to form precipitate if i was a life of proteins. So this. I would almost say this ancient habit of. Adding tea to melike is just basically the norm. Go failand interactions. If people have known. Already. For centuries. So to summarise interaction. Of phenolic compounds with protein eighty's material. Which means for your mind as it's could also be baptized and. Proteins. They can be distinguished. Into covalent eery first of all interaction. And known covalent which are. Reversible interactions. And the effects on food aroma formation. Astringency. And or and also the physical perception of drinks etc haze and the sediment formation.",

                "text": "Welcome to this knowledge clip. In which i will explain. Which enzymes are needed to degrade cellulose completely into glucose. For this. We need a couple of enzymes. To start with. We need. And the glue can exist and if this is my cellulose to sell a better one for links. You can. And this is my end of look unaids it can. Cleave in the middle of my cellulose chain. So next to end the blue canaries is i need. Order enzymes name cell a bio hydro lasers and to sell a bio high delays is conclusive. Idea from the reducing and. Or from the non-producing and. They can clear off. Sello bios molecules and sell a bios. Is a dime or of two glucose units but i want four linked. So now the third and so on we need to really degrade all the seller bios. Into glucose. Is a better course of days or not to name a cell by yes. And this enzyme can cleaved my center bio's. Completely into two glucose molecules. So this three enzymes are needed to degrade settler's completely. Into glucose. However recently. A new class of in science has discovered. Which are the lithic. Oxygen exists. And they can cleave. Also in the middle of the said last chain. But these enzymes have an. Oxidative cleavage. So they can help and the crew can he says. We can also look at the same. Enzymes in a more scientific way. So here i have my solo smaller kills. And cellulose consists out of. Crystalline parts. Or amorphous parts and amorphous parts are more. Whose parts and on this parts then look you can aces are active. While. The seller by a high delays us. Are active on the crystalline reducing are non-producing ends. And the little oxygen aces. Can be active on the crystalline parts cleaving also in the middle of the said hello stains. And both the l.p.m. mouse and the blue canaries is. They create a new chain and read a seller bio hydra lasers can be active on. So then the resulting sello bios. Again can be converted into glucose. By the seller by years or better glucose or days. So to remind you to sell or buy a hide will. I do laser is active towards crystalline cellulose. And as you have seen it can act in synergy with that and the blue can ace the end the blue can is connected synergy with the seller by a high delays. And is mainly active towards them or just part of the cellulose molecules. And the third enzyme to sell a by yes. Which pleased the seller bio's into glucose molecules. It's also helping to sell a bio hard release because several bios is an inhibitor of the cell or bio hard to release some applications of say lasers are in a baking industry where city lasers can help to obtain a softer dough. Or in the brewing. So in making beer for example where the filter ability becomes better. We have less blocking of the filters. When we degrade the cellulose presence or into wine and use projection. Celie lasers can help to degrade the plant cell walls that increased a huge field. And also. If we degrade the cellulose implant biomass completes to two glucose the glucose can be converted into both. Biofuels biochemicals. So now i have a question which enzymes are needed to degrade cellulose completely into glucose. And what does them out of action. Of this. And times needed well as we have seen in this knowledge clip. This are the seller by a hydra lasers that and the clue can aces in the cellar by yes. And we have this because their mode of action. On the cellulose molecules. So to summarize. We have seen the activity of in the loop in a to sell a bio hydrolysis and sell a bias on cellulose. You've looked at our mode of action. And we have seen that they act synergetic. Into the grid it's. Cellulose. So thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Welcome to this knowledge clip where i will show you some examples of pectin degrading enzymes. Or pectin assist in the food industry. For example in tomato processing. We can make use of fact in degrading. Enzymes which are already present in tomatoes. And in this. This case we name that ender genius lee present. Tech tenacious. So two examples are polar galaxy or naser pick them attila us race present in the tomato itself. And the tomato can make use of the enzymes during ripening of the tomato. So now when we want to protest this tomato. We can think of two processes. One is a process called called break. In this process. We have a low temperature. And during this low temperature process. So not higher than twenty thirty degree celsius. The enzymes. P. me and p.d. remain active. So they can degrade the pectin. In the tomato. So what we get is a very. Liquids. Made so. Well. Material. Liquefied material. And from this liquefied material it's easier to separate water from. So in this case we can make a really thick. Paste or tomato paste. However an order. Famous product from tomatoes is ketchup and catsup is much more viscous and. For to make this ketchup we make use of the heartbreak process in the hot break. We increase the temperature. To this high temperature that the enzymes p.d.n. p m e r in activated. So we can make use of steam for example. If these enzymes are a neck to fade it's the pickton in a tomato is not degraded and what we have left. Is a more viscous. Tomato. Yeah. Paste actually. So i can show us well here. Here. We have the cold break result so really a thick paste. Where evaporated the water from. And here we have the result of the heartbreak. So more to ketchup like. Tomato paste. Another example where we make use of pectinate this is in clarification of apple juice. So in a natural setting. When we press jews. Out of apples. The juice is cloudy. And this clouds. Is built from a protein pectin complex. So if we enzymes if we add pectin ace's to this cloudy juice. We can be great. This protein packed in complexes. And then after. Filtering. Filtering we have a clear juice. What is an additional effect of this technique is activity that we also increase the yield of the epilog use. And also we get a more intense color. To increase the juice. Yield. Even further. Next the pectin ace's beacon etc lasers. So that's a whole pectin structures in the plant cell wall. Are completely degraded. And also the cellular structure in the plant cell walls. And then we achieve a completely. Reflection. And a maximum juice yields. So in a scheme. That looks like this. We can start with the fruits. So the ep all. After grinding or. Making their into pieces we obtain a pill or pieces of apple. And now if we add to this pieces of apple. Pick the naysayers and sell it lasers. We can obtain a total liquefaction. And then when the press are filtered the material. We have a very good yields. Of the apple juice from our apples. And also. I will see a clear juice. And i can also show you that in a little experiment. So thirsty. We can't kurds. And i pull in pieces. And here i have two flasks. In both flocks. Flasks an equal amount of apple pieces present. To both flask. The edits. Fifty amount of water. Now this flask. Is my control. I will not add anything else. And to this flask. I will add both pectinate is this and selling lasers. So i add my enzymes. Xor genius the little bit of solaris. And a little bit of picked a nice. I will close the flasks. Shake them a bit. And i will put both flasks. In an incubator. At forty degrees celsius. So as i said. We can also make use of pectin a says to obtain a clear juice. If we do not want the cloudy juice in this case to be at pectinate as to the cloudy juice which is the normal juice. When the press pulls and after filtering. I can obtain a clear juice. So in this way i can adapt. My process. Of the juice. According to the products. I would like to obtain. So now i have a question for you. Rich. Enzymes. I needed to achieve. Completely protection. Of apples and what is the effects of the addition of these and times. Well the enzymes we need for completely. Perfection. Are both. Tech today's us. To degrade the pick them in a cell wall. And sell lasers to degrade the cellulose in the apple cell wall. And the effect of this through enzymes. Is that the. Reduce the water bombing capacity to get hired you shields. The picton ace's degree. Degrades the protein. Packed and complexes so we obtain nuclear juice. And the cellar lasers help in completely perfection. Of the cell walls to obtain the highest jewish heels we can get out of it's. And i have to go back to this experiment we started. At the beginning of this knowledge clip and we look better. Back at the end in a water. We can see that not a lot happens. But if we have a look at the episode every edit. Picked amazes and seven lasers. We do see we have a completely fiction. And now i would like to show you. Also the yields. In both cases. So here i have my cylinder. In one cylinder i will add the juice. What i for after addition of pectinate this in cellar lays this and to the other still in there i will add my blank. Apple juice. Without edition of any enzymes. So now we can look at the results. In the case of our blank. I pod use. We obtained. Forty three. Of. Well. Water with use. Because if we think back. At the beginning of the experiment to both flask we had it's fifty m. out of water and in the case of my enzyme three to juice. Sixty six. Of water per skews. So my juice yield is much higher in the case of the effectiveness and said or less three the apples. And not to be completely correct. The amount of enzymes. We edits the months of pectin isn't selling lasers. The same amount of water. We added to the blank. Three to airports. And also we of course. See a clear difference in color. And we cannot have a look inside the filter. If i place them like this. In the case of the blank. Experiments. We have the pieces left. And the enzyme three does well we still have a little bit of liquid inside the filter. But only a little bit of fibers particles. But no. I left over. So. Now to summarise. In this knowledge clip we have seen death. Picked amazes can be applied in the processing of tomato. To make a more fiskars. Or a more sick tomato paste. And we can use pick the nacelles for juice. Apple juice clarification. And both pectinate us and said the lasers can be used to completely. Liquefy plant cell walls. To obtain the highest yield. Possible. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I'm going to talk about the structural properties of pectin. You might know packed in. Because it's one of the most important jelling agents in for example jams and jellies. Not here you see different sources from commercial sources. And uses of pectin. At the two main commercial sources are. Apple palmers or. Cypress pill. I hear you see pictures of. An apple and an out of the apple apple pumice is made from the apple pie most. Packed and can be extracted from this the white powder that you see there. And this can be used. Extra to make a jam. To gel the jam or. Different uses here you see a list of uses c. can be added to fruit drinks or juice concentrates jams and catch. Even our dressings and sometimes even back to his attitude yogurt. Not packed in is used in all of these products. Because of the jelling property that pectin house. Now where do we find. Packed in. Actually packed in his phone and. All cell walls of plant material. So all plants have in their cell wall packed in. Most of the packed in is found in the middle. And then there is also packed in the primary cell wall and. If there are secondary cell walls not all plants fell's have. But if you have secondary cell walls. Then there are often also small amounts of packed in there. And here you see a picture of the cell wall. And the middle of the load so that is the part between the cells. That is where most of the facts and can be found sort of the green lines that you see here. Those are to packed in molecules. Also in a primary. While you find. Pectin molecules next to of course. And here we saw the losses. Now i'm going to talk about the structure of pectin. And here is a simplified model of how a pack to my. Looks like it has so what we call hairy regions. And smooth. Regions and another hairy region and it all has specific names. But what is important for us to understand is that this smooth region dippolito like to roll nam. That is the pars here with the main chain. Where we have the gallic to run an acid unit. There are several other units in the pack to molecule. But demain chain is to run it as it's next to each other. Back so molecule has about two hundred to five hundred units that pending on the source and. When we talk about a jelling properties of the pact thing than this part which is only the whole moral. Part that is the part where the jelling is meet with what is a galaxy s. it's actually because galaxies running out of this to mean wrested you and packed in. It's an. You're wrong make acid. And you run it acid. You can. You can find to your own accosted by looking at them on a cycle right and then you see that the motorcycle ride has an acid group here. So that this different from. For example which doesn't have an acid trip. And here you have different examples of your own and asked it so this is to. Gallic from it as such which is present and pectin. But for example in gum a rabbit. We have. Quranic asset and. L. junaid should find a man to run it assets or run it assets and. You're right you're running. Assets when they may bump into each other pretty strong bonds meaning that if you want to hydrolyzed the bond. It takes a lot of efforts. I hear you see digg i like to run an asset. Next to each other in depicting molecule. They make a one floor blonds first carbon here connects with the fourth carbon here. And now you see the acid group. But if you look really carefully you see that in this picture. A few of the s.s. groups are. Mathlete as us. Call that. So if you look here down here. You see does. There is a math a group. Connected to the acid group you see does here to this here. Is a muscle group connected to the acid group. And that is an important. Property of packed ins. You can have a difference between. High mets allayed has a low mid to late attacked us. And i show you the difference here with two pictures the one up here. If you look at the ass of groups thing you see does three out of five have a meth related methylated group. And we call this. H. pac ten or a high meth salita pac ten and one down here. Only one out of fife. So about twenty percent. Is mathlete it. So we call this a lol. That's related or an l. pact and the difference between high and low much elated. Is. When it's more than fifty percent we call it more or less. High methylated then when it's lower than fifty percent we call it a low mets elite impact. And the difference between the two is very important for the kind of. Gel that's a pact and will give. Let's see if you can read the pictures here of to run it as it so. God likes ronit acids. To mean raschid you. Of pac ten isn't your run it asked it. And it's comparable to one of the normal motorcycle rides. So which of these three mono cycle right is actually this your own nic acid coming from. Now here you have the answer. You can already see it by the name so it's called. Ga lack to runit acid so that means that it comes from god liked it was would say you don't really want to. Acid. Of gallic toes. And you can also see that by looking at the position of each groups. How do its groups are positions toward the rings from chair. So to concludes. We talked about the structure of packed in a packed in is a very important component in the cell wall. It has a very core. Like structure. But the main unit is a god like to an acid and. If you have a high methylated tact and many of the good luck to run it gets our mats elated and if you have a low monthly detect and then only a few of the electronic assets are massively. To it.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip is about the jelling properties of pectin a pectin is a molecule that is present in for example jam that makes the jam gel the. Acting can then come from the food itself. Or might also be added to make this gel. I hear i have a picture of for you it's an atomic force microscope picture. All of a gel. That is made would impact and. What the if used is only serial point two five percent of the pac ten. And then a lot of sugar. Sixty five percent of sucrose. And then some assett. And this case it's a buffer sort of mission. And this together big such a pact a molecule starts to gel and you see that by pectin. Molecules that make interactions with each other. In this mall this clip. I'm going to explain to you how pectin molecules can make a gel how that works. And to understand that you first need to look. And realize what the packed a molecule looks like. Now most of the put back to molecule the structure. Has your run of assets. The connectivity each other these are gallic to runit acids. So they have facets group here you see several acid groups that. What is important of acid groups is that these groups can have a negative charge depending on the p. h.. So here this acid. Group became negatively charged. Because of the change in ph. If we have a ph of seven. Than most active groups half this negative charge. And if we now lowered to ph two for example ph three. Then all the assets. Group. Become neutral. So there is no charge anymore on the pectin molecule. And this is a very important aspect off the pectin molecule to remember that depending on the p. h. there might be or might not be a charge on the pectin molecule. I'm going to explain you two different types of gel that pectin molecule can make. And the. First gel i'm going to explain to you is the calcium gel. Now not all types of molecules make it back. In general it's the l. and pectin. That makes a couch and gel. And let's see how that works. So here you see packed in molecules. I show you with three different strands you have the degree impact a molecule on here a purple one. Or orange one. And the blue one. And they make. Interactions with each other and by making this interaction. Than you make a gel. Now how is the interaction between these pectin molecules in the case of the calcium gel. What happens is that calcium. Ions. And you see that with the black dog. The calcium. Ions. They have a positive charge. They make a bridge. And i only bond between two different pectin. Strands. So here you see. One strength. And here you see the other one. Not. There are negative charges on the pac ten. Depending on the p. h. we have a relative high p. h. now. So it are negative charges. And a negative charge of one strand is connected with the other. Fire the calcium. And there's a bridge is often called the ach. Walks. Model. Because you have several calcium. Molecules next to each other that make the two strands combine with each other and this is a possible. Gel that you can make with a low methylated. Pectin. If you look at the higher methylated packs and what we've done often use. Is a sugar as a gel. I hear you. Again. The. The backbone of the pectin molecule. And now you see that not all. You have the you run it as in here you have to acid groups some groups are methylated in this case. Three out of five year old assets are methylated to be called as a high methylated pectin and. To make a gel with a high methylated packed into what you can do is add a lot of sugar. And some ass shit. How does that work. The sugar. That is what i represent here with these little rounds. These are the sugar sugar molecules. And they attract water. So do you hold the water. If you have a lot of sugar you lower the water activity which means there is last water. Available for the pectin molecules. And that is why the pack to molecules are forced to want each other they cannot be in the solution. So what they do is they get next to each other close to each other and then the p. h. also helps by adding assett. You take a way to charge from the acid groups that are still present. So this acid group here at the low p. h. has no negative charge. And if all the pack them all the cubes have no charge there is a last repulsion between the pectin molecules sort of both high sugar concentration. And a low acid that is what you need to make a sugar. Acid gel. That you've seemed to to friend. Type of gel that we can make with a pact and we can make either a calcium gel or a sugar acid job that i hear. I have two questions for you. First question is why will the methylated group never become negatively charged. And the second question i have for us which type of pack tim will be use for jam. Will it be a high methylated or a low methylated. Pectin. Now here you have the answers. Now why amass a liter of group. Will never become charged here you see the actually group that is methylated and of course now. The the it cannot come up anymore and this group cannot become that can simply charge so. There is no car book seller group here. And the answer to second question is packed in its own mentally that paxson which have almost no real asset groups there. And. Because there are only a few of these acid groups. There will only be a little bit of charge. And we want. The least charge for this type of. So to summarize. We talked about the jelling properties of pectin. And it's very important for judging properties. How much charge sure is on the parts and molecule. Not just charts depends on the p. h.. And you can make two times. The two different kind of gel she can make either a calcium. Gel or a sugar acid.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip i would like to discuss the control. And even innovation of and symmetric oxidation of phenolic compounds. By the addition of sulfur containing. Compounds. So what is the mode of action of sofa containing. Compounds that inhibit browning. Let's first go to the to the enzymatic browning cascade. You start with familiar compounds. And due to the presence of poly of the enzyme part of no oxidase. And the presence of oxygen from other compounds are being concerted into key knowns. These key knowns. Are converted into di most and all of them earth. And eventually polymers are formed. Which are brown. So what is the mode of action. Of the silver. Containing compounds when they inhibit the browning. First. It is the binding. To the key knowns. And second. The end of the enzyme. Volitional oxy days. So what kind of silver containing compounds are we talking about the most important one is self. So fight. And another group of molecules are the tiles. And an example of a tile. Is the a minor as it's fifteen. And you can see here the tile means. Free as age group. So let's go first to. What is still fight. There are many. There are different forms of still fight. Itself or dioxide. It's so. So for the sodium sulfite. It's sodium by sulfide or which is also called. Sodium hydro hydrogen sulfide. And sodium. Made up by sulfite. And these different forms of still fight are in equilibrium with each other the first equilibrium. Is the is the one between the major beisel five. And sulfur dioxide. And silver some silver. Sulfide. And you can see here that. The major beisel fight is basically an addict. Of these two other forms of so find the most important equilibrium. Is between the older forms off. Of still fight. And he can see when we have so often dioxide which is a guess. And when it's presence in water. It basically it's disallows in water under the formation of. So for us as it all this will for us as it is in equilibrium isn't as it so it can dissociate depending on the. Ph. And it's in equilibrium with hydrogen sulfide. And a free political and when we increase the ph. We have a second equilibrium. Which forms. Still fight. And i'm not a free person group so let's go to the mode of action when silver component silver compounds our buying to do keynotes. What we see here is the first step of the browning. Cascades. A key known is being formed by the p.p.o. enzyme. It reacts with another female. Into a dime or. And these dimas. Eventually form. Brown products. So what happens now. If we if we had sulfur containing compounds. They react. If the key known and. So the key known is taken out of the equation. And no dimer is formed so no bull america material is being formed. And if you look to the chemistry. What happens is that we have a nuclear filling attack. Of the silver containing. Compound. To the keno and we get a co failand bulled. And in this case it's a diode. Phenolic. Compound. The other mode of action. Which is the activation of the enzyme oxidase. Contains a copper ion. And in the kettle it. In the catalytic center and. In this can tell if extended are also a lot of. He said in. Residues. Which is which is depicted here. So what happens if we had still fight. If we had sulfides it reacts with the histidine. To which the copper ion is being bound. And what you can see here. Is that we have a co failand interaction. If the sill fives and histidine. Of the enzyme. Which makes the enzyme inactive. And that we can see in the next light. And i will explain this light to you what we see here is gloria jean it s. a solution of laura jean it s. it. And in the solution also oxygen is present and. The enzyme know oxidase is present and up to and on the y. axis. Is the amount of received you will oxygen. Present in the solvent. And what we can see here is that. Throughout time. Within fifteen hundred seconds. All the oxygen. Is being used up. And how is it being used because because its its reacts. If. If the glora jeana guess it. So we can see here. Is depicted the activity. Of the enzyme and. It's quite active and. All the oxygen. Present is being used. And what happens now if we if we had. So find that we can see here. In the beginning. The enzyme is still active. Not as much as active as. In the absence of still fight. But that after a certain period. You know we see that the oxygen level is not decreased anymore. Which means that the enzyme is completely inactivated. And what you can see here. That the inactive face is not instantaneous. But it's a slow in active phase in which takes some time. But eventually the enzyme is completely in activated. So we see that swordfight has a pronounced effect it is basically and you will effect. It has an effect on the key known it has an effect on the. On the enzyme. So one of the advantages are we can apply. It can be applied. When heating or. Lowering it be age which is also a method to any active fady enzyme. Is not favorable. Because of other reasons maybe the food and as a condition of the food is not optimal and. The enzyme is permanently in act if it were also sold. This at fault it is to the addition of still five. And one disadvantage is that if we add still five it can discolor eight and zero science. And here we have an example where we have strawberries. On the left side. And then we have a strawberry juice. Where we added. We have added. So five. And you can see that. It's completely. Discolored but also a model of this had found that is if you add high. Proportions of sulfide it got to give a flavor formation. And also it decomposes. Fight the main b. one. So let's go to a question. At which ph. Is sulfide. Most effective. Is it at b. it's three. Or is it that be it six. Well the answer is it be a six because at b. a it's three. The so find. Is mostly. In the s o two forms. And the silver dioxide the s o two form is full of tile. So it will disappear from the food and hence. It's not present any more. So it's not active. To rev up the mode of action. I'll still fight. Is twofold. First it's a binding to the key known. It is an instantaneous process. And the inactivation of the enzyme p.p.o.. Which is a slow process. And a mode of action of files. Is that the. Binds to keynotes.",

                "text": "With this knowledge clip. I would like to discuss the control and even the innovation of enzymatic oxidation the phenolic compounds. By the use of. Collating agent and. Ascorbic acid. The are two different species. And also two different note of actions. To the glazing agent. Collating agent. They bind. Metal ions. And there is a copper iron present in a couple of extended all the enzyme bodies in the last few days. B b o. So accumulating agent. Binds the copper wire. And the next sample. Very well known. Example which is used in the food industry. Of a collating agent is such a sad trick as it. It is a three couple. As it is called i guess it. Also known as fight and then see. It reduces the key knowns. Back to phenolic compounds. So let's go to the. Collating agents. Here we see the enzyme in the last two days. And in the enzyme. There are two copper ions. And a collating agent. Is capable to bind. To these corporate ions. And basically to extract the core prions. Out of the. Catalytic center. This is depicted here. We have the copper ion. We have the moloch a structure of such as it. And he we see. The complex. With a copper ion. That is being called lex aided by the three groups. And when this complex is being formed and. In activated and signed. Is left behind. And hence used the reaction is being inhibited. So let's go to a school that. Yes it. The first step in the oxidation. Reaction leading to brown. Run course is the archie days inn of diet. Of the dive and also into keynotes. By the enzyme p.p.o.. Under the influence of oxygen and then brown pigments are being formed. And what happens now. If fight them in c. is present. And when you fight them in c. is added to a food that's called me guess it. Fight in n.c.. Is being oxidised into the hydro ascorbic acid. And it's oxidized by the keno which was previously previously. Formed by the p.p.o.. So discovered. As it is being oxidised. And in the meantime the chemo is being reduced to death to do or die for an all and then this reaction. Continues. The new. Molecule. Die from no it's being oxidised but in the next year the chemo is being reduced by the ascorbic acid. And we can see that in the next light. So on the y. axis. The absorption. Four hundred nanometers is being the pictured. Are basically brown. Brown color is being depicted. And on the x. axis. It's the time. And we see that wave in time. We got the formation of a brown color. But if ascorbic acid is present. We see that bubble in time. Nothing changes. Of hope two thousand seconds. Of thinking. But after two hundred two thousand seconds. We see that. The brown coloring appears. Well how is that possible. It's. It's very simple. Because around two. So thousand seconds. All the. Ascorbic acid. Is being depleted. So. Like i said before. The formation of the key known. Continue. Continues. Because the enzyme itself it's not in activated. The key known was being reduced by this call because it. But at the certain moment. There is no ascorbic acid any. Any more present. And then. The reaction. Still continues. Keynotes are being formed. And then this key knowns. Can be. Can be converted into diameters all of them earth and probably mimic material which gives the brown color. So let's go to the question. Until now. I have discussed. The enzymatic browning reaction. But in the food industry there's also another important browning reaction and it's the my r. browning reaction it's a chemical reaction. And how can we now distinguish the and symmetric browning. From the norm and some at the grammy. Basically we have three met. Three methods. First we can measure the oxygen consumption. The enzymatic browning. Heavily depends on the presence of oxygen. The second method is that we know if it's an enzymatic reaction. So we can add. Ascorbic acid. Or we can at the soul fight. Because it inhibits the enzyme and a third. Method is that we can add a glazing agent. The collating agent binds the copper iron in the. Enzyme. And it becomes inactive. So to summarise. Collating agent binds the copper iron in the enzyme. Making the end. Enzyme in active and ascorbic acid. Reduces the key knowns. Back to phenolic compounds. So as long as there is it's called big as it present. There is no brown. Coloring.",

                "text": "In this no less clip. We will learn about them and enzymes needed to be great back then which are picked in mazes becton. Is present in for example plan cell walls of f. will then repress out. To jews of this poll. B. get f.l. jews. But we get a very. Target. As you can see in this bottle. Now we can do a little experiments. We can add a little bit of this turbot. Apple juice. Into chips. So now. To one of the chips. I will not add anything. So i don't need to target. A produce. However to the auto tube i need to place it down for a moment. I will add. Picked an ace. With this nice bipeds. I can buy put out a bit of the picked a nice. And that's. To my target juice. And now we're going to incubate. Disturbed apple juice with pectinate for a while. At forty five degree celsius. And also to target apple juice without and slime. And later in this knowledge clip we will see what happens. So as a says in a poem sell well of apples. Pectin or curse. And here we have a schematic over a few of plumb cell wall. Of fruits and vegetables. And all the examples i should go beat or tomato. And in this problem cell wall. We mainly have primaries cell walls. And in this primary cell walls. We have said. We have a little bit of humor i say los which is covering the settlers a little bit. But a large part of these primary cell walls is pectin. Depicted here with the yellow lines. And as i've said. We can be great to specs and respect in a sense. Now pickton. Is one word but its core first. A lot of different structures which are also shown on this lights. And you can already see from all this complex structures that we will need many different. Enzymes. To degrade. All this three years completely. Into dimona units. So pixel naser is also a name covering a lot of a lot of specific. Enzyme activities needed. So in this knowledge clip we will focus. At a specific part of the pectin. Namely this moves regions. But the actin. Contains two parts. The smooths regions. And the hairy or branched. Regions and schematically it looks like this if we have picked them this moves the regions are very linear. While the branched regions are very branched. It is in the name. So in this knowledge skip we will focus at the smooth regions and on home and to the great home again. We need a couple of enzymes. So my examples of the branch regions are there were none. Depicted here. Actually we have the whole morgan letter and backbone. But in this case we have side change which comes to the name. The remember. And if we need an enzyme to cleveland is back well. It's exactly like to run and hide relays. And all the parts of the picked instructor. Is the rem no gallic there are none. In this case we have. Alternating ran out and collect the want to guess at units. And also here you see so many. Of enzymes needed to degrade destructors. And on this run the garlic there and then we can have longer changed. For example or of gullickson. And also hear more and slimes are names which can degrade to specific structures. Now we go back to the homo collector and structure. To degrade homo greylock thurman he basically needs a couple of enzymes get it through an ace. Yes and pectin ly yes. But next to this. The problem raises. We also need an enzyme. Named. Spec to make the list a race. Which is an s. or hide relays or carbide. S. to raise. And why do we need also to this picks in mental s. to race. Well. We will see that on the next slide here. We have the structure of a home and then the home ok look to return. Units. Is a good look through on it s. it units. So it's a sugar ring. But on the c. six. We have an s. a group. And some of the collector on s.s. units. Heavy metal group. On the se group. So in this case. It is a metal aid of pectin. And if we have many of these metal proofs present. We have a high pick them. And if not then it's a low mid to late the pectin. Now the enzymes which cleave in the middle of this pollock elector and chain. Can be hindered by this metal group's presence. So their combs. Our pectin estrace. And slime. Which think leave off. Dismiss all groups. So when we have the pectin estrace active. On this methylated tamaki leg thrown on parts. We get. Effect and structure. Without this metal group. So it kind of support of the. Checked in with a high degree officer if you can make us rich occasion. In this case. And it starts next to a free car box hill group. So that means a group which is not that elated. Then we have this demented later. Electronic as its. Units. We have an enzyme which can be active. It belongs to the hydro layers family enzymes. So it needs the water. To be able to be active. And as you can see it splits in the middle of the backbone of this pickton structure. It needs water. And we get a simple. Hydro lace activity. Every v.a.. Through an ace is p. g.. So as i said it's a hard release. And we have to conclude in the middle of the backbone or. Which acts more from the end of the change. But it can be either end though. Two or nays us. And also this and i'm prefers to cleave next to her free car group. So discount work together with the proximity less to raise. Now we have another enzyme which please. Also in the middle of the back bone. But this enzyme. Picked a lioness does not need water. To be active. It belongs to the group. Of the law is us. And when it cleaves in the middle of this trip to. Also on a low mentholated pectin we get a cleavage. And we get a formation of a double bones. This is what we named better. Elimination. Now we have an order and i'm which is very similar to the one we had before. First we had a picked a lioness. Now. It's affecting law yes. This enzyme. Is also active on the pectin backbone. But now when it's late at all we have this metal group present. It's also a lie a so it doesn't require one. Took leave. And i promptly forget. Also this one. Forms a double bomb. In the structure. And now it cleaves. Next to a methylated electronic essid unit. So in one flight an overview of the enzymes needed to degrade homo collect around him. We have the pectin estrace which can work together with the poly get like through an ace or we have a pact in la yes. Which cleaves as ally is forming a double bond in i'm at the latest pectin. Or the peck tate la ace. Also in cleaving. In the home a collector in and which is not. Methylated. Now we come back to the application of this pic today's us. We started this knowledge a clip. With the target. Apple juice. If i go back to my target apple juice. It is incubated respect in a system. We have also often think of beige and centrifuge the two chips. And now we will see what happens. We have the two of an apple juice. Where we did not add any enzyme. And we have the apple juice. Where we added the pectin nace and off the sensor if you geisha as you can see the picton ace three did. Apple juice. Became a clear. Apple juice. So we can make use of this picked a nice activity when we would. When we want to make a clear effort to use all the applications. You can think of is. If you want to influence the firmness of a fruit or vegetable or. You can make use of the activity versus the in activity. Of pectin ace's. For example when we make tomato ketchup. Also pick the names as can be added to. Two feeds. To improve the digestibility for the animal. And pick the mazes can be used to upgrade jews. So we have less waste. And we can make use of picts naser is for the production of sustainable biofuels biochemicals now i have a question. What is the function of pectin. In a plum cell wall. Well we have seen that pectin. Is mainly present in the primary cell walls. Of fruit and vegetables. And this can be seen as the cement or the glue that holds together to cellulose he mysel in those fiber reels and i have another question in this scheme. The instructor and receives a certain arrows. And you feel in which enzymes are active. Belonging to the different arrows presented. Well. The enzymes we have discussed in this knowledge clip. To summarize from this present in the problem cell walls of the ball and fruits. The main structure we have discussed in this knowledge clip. Is home a collector or none. And we have discussed the enzymes on this home or through an instructor. As through a victim impact. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "This nano scape will explain the architecture of plant cell walls. So the problem cell wall in. Mainly cereals and grasses like we have over here. Is pills from three. Important polymers. As we can see on this slide. The principles are built from cellulose. He by cellulose and lignin and if we come from the grasses. The plants are built from plant cells. And the outer layer of the problem cells. Is called. The problem cell wall. And in this plum cell wall. We have this cellulose fiber ilse and this cellulose fiber else. Are covered with the myself. And in between. We have lignum as a glue. And if we have a closer look at these three polymers. For example when we look at cellulose. We can see that it's a better one for links. You can change. And as you can see here. It forms all kind of hydrogen bridges. Which makes it really crystalline. And in formation of fiber else. As is written on the slides over here. The he my cellulose. In grasses and cereals. Is mainly. Exile and molecule. It has a backbone of better run for link silo seal units. And depending on the source. Ready marcello's is present. It may contain. Different side groups. For example or a b. knows. S. it or s. it's all groups. And as we see on this slide. The he marcello's really core versus the cellulose in the plant cell wall. And the last molecule present. Is lichtman and lichtman is a polar phenolic rings. A very complex structure. And it's kind of clues. The cellulose core for to see my cellulose. Together. And we can also have a look at the plan cell walls. For example. Corn. When you take a corn crop with corn kernels. We can remove the corn kernels. As we did over here. And when we take off the outer layer of the corn. Kernel which is a very precise job. You can already see over here we can remove really defy burr alter layer from the. Starchy and the poor which is in the middle of the corn. Kernel and especially this. Fiber part. This outer layer of the corn kernel. Is composed of the cellulose. He my said he loves. Lichtman. While the starchy end of sperm is very nice to eat. Now we can degrade the cellulose and he mysel a lowes with enzymes for the cellulose we need say laser and forty my said los in the case of process and cereals. This was silent. So we need. Silane exists. Now i have a question. What are the main. Three constituents of the problem cell wall. Of cereals and grasses. Well as we have seen in this nice clip. This is cellulose. He mysel a los and more specific. Silent. And of course. The lichtman. So to summarize in this knowledge clip we have seen it in a plant cell wall of grasses and cereals. Mainly cellulose he my cellulose and lignin this present. And we are seeing some of the structural correct risks of this polymers. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "This nala scape will explain which enzymes are needed to degrade starch. Starches present in many food crops. So my samples are. Potato or corn. Of course start is present in weeds week kernels and as you know starch is also present in rice. Starts in itself is a very crystalline polysaccharides. And in this different food groups of starch is present in granules. But the size of these granules differ. For a crop. So he writes the starch granules are very small. While in potato to start granules. Are march larger. So let's have a look at the structure of starch. Well actually the structure of start. Then we divide it in two parts one part is named emily rose and embryos is an all for one for. Linked. Glucose sealed chain. So if we look at this glucose molecule. On this slide. We can say that this si at them is to see warm. The c two three four five. In the ring. And a six. On top of the molecule. So now when we have an alpha one for linkage reeling. To see one of these glucose feel unique to this you four to the adjacent glucose seal units. So really get a linear polysaccharides forms. The other structure present in starch. Is named a mile pectin. Again. We see here to all four one four links. Change. The starts molecule. But now we also have here. The c six of these glucose seal units. Is linked to the c one of the out of glucose heal units. Which gives is an all for one six linkage. And as you can see on the slides. It's really for. A branching. So here we have a branched. Starch. Molecule. The enzymes we need to degrades. This starch structure. Are studied quite a lot. So we know very well the chans imes can degrade this molecule. And the first enzyme we need. Is names. Of i mean lace emulates sleeves in the middle of this one for. Blue can chains and it's and the acting enzyme. Together with this and i'm. We need to go or not a name is the days for the same. And sime this enzyme. Is an x o x thing. And slime. And it cleaves all of those units from the end of the chain. So the product. Of this all for our decks prince. Or blue got all of our second rights. While the product. Of this exo enzyme. Is glucose. Now we have this six link it's just present. But the same enzyme these are my local grocery days can also cleave this all for one six link it's just. Although. March slower. So to days to get a reset emulates are able to cleave. The starch molecule completely into glucose. But there are more starts degrading and symes known. For example. I mean lace. Or pollution days. And these enzyme. Are specifically cleaving the alpha one six link it's just or. Better i mean we know better and relays can cleavage of maltose from the number of juicing and of the alpha glue contains. One example where we make use of this. I mean less activities. Is when we bake bread. So when we start from wheat flour. We also have a bit of better emulates present. Which comes from the. Wheat and is and their genius lee present. And this better i mean lace. Can degrade the starting of wheat flour. Into multo which can be converted by yeast into c o two. Or we can add a bit of all for any less. What we obtain from enzyme supply us who use bacteria or fern guide to produce this of i am malays. In that case it's an ex a genius he added enzyme. And also to offer any less valid form a bit of maltose. Which can be converted by use to the c o two. So. Upon the activity of these and slimes. We can make a more. Airy bread. With a larger volume and is airy bread. Is a lot appreciated by the people in the netherlands for example. Or the applications. Of any lasers are in the production of beer. During the malting process. You make use of the betty emily's present in the grain. To convert to starch and two decks friends. Later on these can be converted further by the yeast into ethanol. Also we can degrade starts. For example into glucose or partly into freaked us by because eyes armories. And these two molecules can be used as sweeteners for example. In can these. And i have a question for you or to. Rich enzymes are needed to degrade starch completely to glucose. And can you explain. The activity of these enzymes a little bit about their mode of action. And what starts to grating enzyme is present in read kernels. Well the first question. Of course we ask here for days or in my local three days. Which is an excellent enzyme. And if you want to be more precise you can describe that this extra enzyme. Chops off too close. From the alpha one four link click on chains. And the order enzyme we need is also emulates which is an endo acting. Enzyme in the middle of this. Alfonse for links glue contains an enzyme present in wheat kernels. Is better and less. So to summarize. We discussed the structure of starch. Divided into m.r. laws. And i mean those in a mile of pectin. And we looked at which enzymes were needed for the enzymatic secondly for cation. Of this starch structures. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Welcome in this enormous clip. I will give a short introduction to proteins. Both teams are present in many different sources. In which they have a natural function. And the ochre dance of proteins in food. Will also be discussed. Both things are present in sources such as fish eggs and milk. But they are also applied in food ingredients to make. Texas a test my an asse the different sources of protein so i divide it in animal. Sources and. Plant sources. In animal sources the most common ones are milk. Act. An animal by products. For instance but proteins are gelatin from the plants proteins. The most well known is soya proteins. In addition different types of like your minnes. Seeds i use it says. Lupine. And sunflower. In addition to these more traditional sources of proteins. That has a lot of features being done to develop. Novel plant. Proteins. So it's yes. But they are coatings quality and or leafy proteins. Form. Leave materials for plants. To understand what proteins are and how they work and food we need to understand their fiction and. The first thing should we look at is a function of proteins in foods. The main aim of proteins in food. Natural ingredients. Is to provide nutrition in milk. It is nutrition for the newborn calf. And in plant seeds. The podiums provide a new source of nitrogen and essential are mine i said for the going plant. In addition to the notational properties of proteins. They can also provide took your success missal tissue or college and. Which provides structure. And stability for the organism for animals. In addition to these things since many proteins are important for the met demolition of organisms. They can have them sign function to help they're just food. They can work as antibodies. Or they can help to maintain the home your stasis fence and maintain the phs in blood. In addition to these natural properties. Of food. Of proteins. They also have a specific function in food products. And again one of the major functions of proteins in food. Is to provide humans. With a good source of nitrogen and essential to mine as it. For instance. Meat cheese and nuts are good sources of proteins. In addition. Also in food products they can help to make texture. I already mentioned my you notice that also gluten are very important in bath. And lastly. Proteins in food industry can be used to provide a source of things. For instance my r.d. action is one of the most important. The excess in food. That provide taste for instance in the voting of coffee. Despite. Despite all the different sources of proteins. They also share a lot of similarities. All podiums are built up. Of a minor assets. And these are mine assets are connected i just as the name suggests. By the presence of an a mine or group. Here on the left and a couple to look at said group. On the right. These two. Functional groups. Are linked to the central carbon atom. And in this way all of mine are as its are the same. The difference between different amount of assets. From the pulpit these of the sides of the said you are for your mind as it's our one. The dick. Reacts by linking the car book civic group. Of one man as it. To the amanda group of a. Of another a man as it. To form. Peptides only goal peptides. Are common. And they have a size of two to one hundred of the minor assets and in this picture you can see the peptide bond. That this forms between the reaction of a public cynic. And in the mind of hope in a child also large to look up at us our forms and then we use the name potence both ends up only peptides. Typically of the size of one hundred to three hundred a minor essence. And if the bedside becomes this large. Typically it also adopts a structure. As you can see here. In a typical structure of a global opposing the properties and the function of the podium depends on the a minor. As it stood built. This thirty year. And also on the total. Folding states of the protein. The old good arms of posies and purpose in food. As i mentioned in plants and animals all materials. We find proteins. For nutritional purposes. Structure. And method billy's. Metabolism. Peptides are found. As diaper types for instance a meat products. Little tea on in wheat flour and that the glutathione helps to make this thirteen and incorporate and the amount of assets and small bedsides are also found in plants materials because they have a home on things in food products. But tides can also be forms as are his sort of fermentation pose as us. City as in cheese. And lastly the. Very important for the food industry. Coatings are very often extracted from different sources such as. Way. From milk. And then these proteins can be added to food products. As an ingredient. Such as ice cream. To provide a better structure. In addition. That sides are produced behind the rising podiums. With enzymes. And then these hydrolysis can be used in split nutrition. Because they have a better digestibility. Fia mind as it's. Can be found in norm. And agenda. Infant formula to reduce the energetic potential of the food. After this short introduction. I have two questions related to the solubility of proteins which is very important for the food applications. The first question is how is the function of meat missile proteins in the body. Related to the so you ability of these proteins. And secondly how is the function of milk proteins. Related to this for you ability of these proteins. If you look through the function of meat or muscle proteins in the body. It is easy to understand that they should not be. Should not be soluble therefore. Missile tissue is not soluble protein. The mill proteins on the other hand should be present in milk which is drunk by the cough. And therefore these proteins should be soluble. In summary. After the short introduction of proteins. You should know the potence are present. In many different sources. Where they have a different. Natural function. In addition they also have different functions in food and. All proteins are build up. As polypeptides. Of a mind as its.",

                "text": "Welcome in this enormous clip. I will explain the basics took your and properties. Of a minor. Acids which are the building blocks of code all a minor essence build up. Of as the name suggests. And i my know group. Here on the left site. And the car books illegal. Here on the top. And these two groups. Are linked to the central carbon atom. The carbon atom. In this way all of mine as his are the same but the. Variation between different types of a mind as it is in the sights and has said you are. Because the sense all. All of our carbon atom is now. Linked to four different. Functional groups. It is called a cattle adam. Which means that there are also still isomers. As i will explain the data. In nature. More than two hundred different types of a mind as has our present. So a lot of different to mine as its high level in proteins. Only twenty nine to a mind as it's. So twenty and mine as i use as building blocks and. All these a mind essence that i use and podiums are all far. L.. A man as it's. What these letters mean. I will explain in the next lights. The still isomers. As i mentioned. R. l. and d.. In the typical structure projection here. With a couple should a group on the left side when it has a jew on the bottom. The minor group. On the left side for the element as it were for the d. minor as it. The mind of god is on that i then side. In nature. And in podiums the. A man as it's that i use the l. a minus it's. And there's that his guilt all the enzymes in the digestive tract. Are built to digest a mine essence. Which means that if you have this amazing. In the high temperature or a different b. age conditions. You get the amount of acids which are not there just a bowl. In addition to distill i somebody. There are all fun and bats are mine as hits. And these thirty in a position of the mind will go up on the carbon atom. For my no groups among the group is attached to the alpha carbon atom. For me that i mind as it's. To the. Beat our carbon atom. As mentioned in podiums only a minor as it's all. In addition to these basic properties of the man as is that is a variation that depends on the side chain. Examples of different side chains of a minus it's are indicated in this graph. Well. For instance we have to perform. Where you see the benzene the ring which is an elemental goop. So we call these a man as it's ever magic man as it is we only have. Hydrocarbon chained. We call it. On the fabric. A man as its and in addition. We have different types of. Photo a mind as its citizens are spotted in which person a might function with a double border of c. c. double and then a minor. As you can imagine that our magic and the fed think a mind. As hits. Do not have any bolder goals. So they do not this all felt about in water. And basically based on the different side chains of the a mine as its we can classified the twenty. Amount of sets of proteins. In c. different groups. We have the non-polar. Non charge of the mind acids which are. Most. Hydrophobic. You have consequences really low so you ability and water. And they are mainly present on the interior part of the protein and the side chain groups that are important in this are the elephant the groups. At all matter groups. And then the two exceptions basically the immuno a set of pole line and the tio eater. Of matey are nine. In addition we have both are. But non charge the mind as its of its we saw in exile in the p.t.s. flight. These are hydrophilic and consequently. Have a good interaction with water and a high so you ability and. They are mostly present on the outside of the protein surface. In addition. You can see that the groups that give these functions are high level chill groups. So if i build groups and am i the groups. And these groups can be active in the certain conditions. Last me. You have the group of boulder. And charge them on essence. So again these amount as it's because of the polarity. Are very well for you a bull in water. Hi hi little felicity. There are persons on the outside of the posy. Again these are he active. Site. Has a juice. And lastly. And this is very important. They can have a chart. So to cobble silica as it goes at low ph. Is in the post in a that form. And is neutral. At higher ph the charge becomes negative. Because if this. Deep alternated and. A mind or group. At the low ph is actually in the potentate that state and then positively charged. And then the high ph. Because the protein a that. And then that this. Neutral in charge. So these are the c. main groups. Of sightings of the mine as its and the pope at least of these are mine as is and the distribution of them in the opposing will determine the total properties of the podium such as solubility. And charge. In addition. That is a division. Based on the nutritional value of a mind s. it's. Basically we have essentially mine as sets that are not produced by the body. So these need to be taken up through the diets. Of a person. That are essential the mynah assets. Which can be produced by the body so you don't need to have them included in the diet and. Conditionally essential to mine as it's. And this law school. Is a group of mine assets that for certain parts of the population for a certain part of their life. May be important to have. In the diet of the higher those which the important part what i want to show about this efficient. Is that. As i mentioned we have yet to find as it's. And if you look as if this is a he active site chain. Are not only in a moment a sense of a mind as it. But also in a conditionally essential. And in the essential. Mind as of class and sense of slicing isn't a mind i said that the extra lot in the my are the action which means that. After that he actually becomes unavailable to the body. So if you have a lot of the actions to a mind as it is you can loose nutritional value. Therefore it is important to understand that the activity of the a minor as a side james. After this short introduction. About a minor essence. I have a question. If you can recognize based on the site in the residue. To which class of a man as it's the following see examples. Belong. If you look. We see lucy in with has no polar side groups. So it is a non-polar and it's just a minor as it. The middle. Glue to make s. it as the name suggests that it is. As it. So there's a folder and charge the man s. it and the last one. That is in. As a. I will met thinking some of you might have seen that this should be non balder non chanced. Side group. Birds. Because of the hydraulic citigroup. Actually the molecule does have a certain polo property. Boto behavior and consequences me it's a boulder. But not charge of the mine as it. And similarly. There are many different types of a minor as it. Present in nature of it's only twenty ochre in podiums. Than mine as it is in a chicken or curtis thehotel isomers. L. or d.. And the properties of these are mine ss are determined by the site in residues. In addition. That he activity of the site in her seduce will determine the nutritional value. It depends on the sitter isomers but also on the site and i said use.",

Before we start in details it is important to the allies weapons come from and what they do. In food. In nature. But that's a peasant. In blood for instance to. Burford the phs to make sure that the bad snuff exceeds a certain value. This is so important. In addition peptides are used implants as. Homeowners to signal. Difference. Pose as he's in foods. But lives can be persons because they are present in a natural product success. Weed flower where glu thought film actually. Is important to stabilize the structure of breath. To incorporate air. In addition both sides can be formed during the post a single food. And this we see in the production of cheese and ham. Well we have michael bio of fermentation. And the enzymes breakdown the indigenous proteins to form peptides. In addition and cementing catalysis can also be used on purpose in the food industry. To put themselves in from formula has increased i guess ability and. Genic but. Potential. In addition there are several changes that his old form. Terms feeling opposing to a peptide. And these properties or functions of the peptides are first of all that they done to be more he active than intact proteins. So it is sometimes less convenient to have popped out. That is why nature makes proteins the positive side is that bedtimes have taste. However in. Hydrolysis. An infant formula one of the problems is that the peptides. Are better. So this is not a desire to property. Peptides in general i think in a more easily by the body. And in addition. There is a lot of research on the by your fictional properties of peptides. So they can have the officer done for pity's blood pressure and pop with these and this is why many people are interested in peptides. To look in more detail what this about that actually a peptide is a combination of a minor edits. And all of them are all. Polymer. In this example the basic structure is that to a man as his so he asked the girl walks in the group of the first of mine as had he acts with a minor hope. Of the second a minor as it. It forms a peptide more and. Describes here and. To make this peptide won't. Wonder what a molecule is released. It is important to realize. Therefore that the weights. Of the tide is slightly smaller than the weight of the two individual a minus it's a diaper tied is one form with of course purpose can go longer depending on the use as going to be forms or even longer peptides. In the way we talk about fights. Typically small peptides are referred to by the. Countable names will die peptides type lives they thought peptides. And the moments where counting inlets and becomes. Inconvenient for people they tend to use the word. Only go peptide so any longer peptide. That is not easy to describe. Is referred to as an all or go peptide. Only when you have larger. Peptides larger than one hundred are minor as it. We tend to call the. Thirds. Opposing the structure of the tides. Can be different. And consequently the naming of the peptide can be different and example is here. The type upside of cysteine. Glutamine. Glue demick i said sorry. And nice in the first. Important parts about a normal click your the presentation of fives. Is to the allies at the end turmel. Site. Is always on the left. This is the a minor as it's whether a mine or group. Is still free. On that item site. We have the c. terminal. A minor as it is the freak in this picture. You see that the sistine is linked to the glue thermic s. it on the wall far. Carbone. The plutonic as it is then again. Links to the. Lies in those who do. By the alpha are carbon atom. Focal vineyards we have switched. If you see it correctly. The orientation of plutonic as it. But they are all linked by the alpha common and this is not always the case in that'll peptides. And a good example is the similar peptide to this one this is also a type that tied with the end terminal. On the left side. But here the glute demick s. it is linked to desist in by the government carbon atom. And consequently we call it. Government glue time you see is the new device in addition. Ill. Is because these are the man as is that are linked to the next. Minor as it. In the notation of the type applied you also see that between as it insisted in that corner of the line. And between cysteine and vice in state line. To indicate that the glue to make as it is not linked by the alpha carbon. In the group. But by the gum are actually and these differences can his hold and differences in they guess ability and information entity. In addition to the type of link that's so on the alpha carbon atom on the carbon atom. There is also another difference between. Peptides. And this is due to the nature of the path that bombs. The peptide bones. Partly because of the double bone that oxygen. But also partly because of the nitrogen. Has the nature of a plane aboard. So it does not have a seat on mentioned all but a flat structure. Consequently the bedside won't occur in a trance confirmation. He presented on the left or the cisco information. As you can imagine. The cisco information. Is not easy because in that confirmation the two side group. Jews are one. Are two. Are very close together. And because of this there is a lot of static imbalance between the group and. As a result in nature most of the. Peptide. Occurred in the time school from asia. However joy impose essing. And heating enfolding of proteins can occur. As a result of the unfolding there may be some freedom between the bombs and then there may be a dozen my zation from the toms to the cisco from asia. To finalize this enormous clip. On peptides. I have a question to you. And this is to go collate the molecular weight of the data peptide. That is formed out of these for a mine as its. If you look to destruction of their mind as hits. It seems fairly easy to calculate the weight of the amount of the total data peptide. Because you can just sum up the molecular weight of your mind as it's. But this is wrong. Because you have to realize that in the process of making the peptide. In each formation of a. Bond. Iwata is lost. So you need to subtract. See times. The waves of water. And that's it he silt. The total weight of the day the peptide is five hundred ninety one point six grams per mole in somebody in this lecture about peptides. We have shown the bedsides are present in different sources. They are formed by a minor s.s. that are linked in a peptide bonds and the nomenclature of the peptide depends on the size. The types of a minor acids that are present. And the type of the peptide bond.",

                "text": "And it's not as clear if i would like to discus. The control and innovation of and so medical two days in a phenolic compound by the addition of still fight. The enzymatic oxidation of phenolic compounds starts. If the phenolic compound. Then under the influence of the enzyme days. In the presence of oxygen. Keenan's are being formed. The scheme. Keynotes form dimmers. All of us and eventually polymer us. Which give a brown color. To a food and. The name. And so i made that browning. So how can. Silver containing. Compounds. Still fight. But also a number of files. Like the. I mean no acid cysteine. How can they prevent and some i think drowning. Well. The first mechanism is that these molecules. So far. So fight and. Some files. They bind. To the key knowns. Which then. Are converted to self or diode phenolic. Compounds. So if the sill fight. And that heal group here. Depicted. For sixty in the autumn. Meghan ism. Of inhibition. Soley relates to still fight. And it's the. Dying the bend and. Inhibition. Of the p.p.o. activity. So it's basically in activation of the enzyme. And it only occurs with still five. So let's move to still five still fight consist in several species. As of two as of three. To minus eight s. or three minus. And as the. S. to over five to minus. So sulphur dioxide. Sodium so five. Sodium by. Sulfides. Which is also called sort in height of hydrogen sulfide and so you meet a beisel five. So there are different species. Different products on the market. Which can be added to food. To inhibit the enzymatic. Oxidation. So there is an equilibrium between these species. And the first equilibrium i would like to mention is the one of meta beisel five. Which is in equilibrium we have silver dioxide and. And by sulfide. The other equilibrium which is much more important for food. It's. It's the equilibrium. If it's self or dioxide which forms together with water. Is in equilibrium is an essence. And this as it decomposed is in equilibrium with its dissociated form. H s s three minus an explosive. Which is also an acre librium. Is to fully dissociated as it. So this. This is equal librium. Is of course be a dependent. And you could see at low ph. We have predominantly. Water and sulfur dioxide. While. At high ph. We we we have this self to by sulfide. To mine as i am. So depending on the ph. We have different species present. So the first step of. Inhibition and i here give the example of. Of the inhibition by. Your group. Is the binding to the to the keynotes. We have a key known. Which is prone to further oxidation. If you don't ever dial the skin or together with this a minor as if it's on a teal phenyl. And this. Molecule cannot react. Further in the cascade of reactions in which i've shown before so it cannot react to a dime or or two in all a coma and hence we don't get any. Brown pigments formed. For this is met. This inhibition. Applies to seals. And it also applies to sulphite. Now we are dealing only with so five. Because only still five. Is capable of in active active facia of the enzyme p.p.o. and. The reason why this is capable of in activation. Is that. In the catalytic side of the. Of the enzyme. There is the copper ion. And this is his it in present. Which is depicted here. And if we know at still fight it and it reacts. If the histon in. It forms a complex. And here you can see the copper ion. And now we've got a co-payment link between the sill fied. And the histidine. So basically the a minor as a the. The a minor as it is. Changed and. The enzyme. Is completely modified. And it is not. Active anymore. The distaff is a slow step. Which is depicted in in the next graph. What you can see here. On the y. axis is the consumption of oxygen. So we have here a system where we have. Laura jean it as it. The phenolic compound. We have the enzyme p.p.o.. And we measured you consumption. Of oxygen in time. And which means that. After fifteen hundred minutes. All the oxygen in the reaction file is used up. So the enzyme. Is pretty act. If if we now at sill five we see that in the beginning. And the enzyme still uses a oxygen. But it's leveled off. So at a certain moment. There is still oxygen. Present in the system. But it's not consumed anymore. It means that the enzyme is. Is is in active. And what you can see there. But there is still a slow decrease and what we can see. Is that after the second edition of still five. We even have an increase in active facial of the enzyme. So what can we learn from this is the addition of still fight. In activates the enzyme. But it's not an instantaneous process. It's a slow process. So what are the advantages of adding sulfur containing compounds. Well they can be applied in situation where. Heating or lowering of the ph. Is not an option. Because eating. Has a negative effect. Of the on the food. In general. Another example and it's specifically. Applies to to still fight. We have a permanent an active phase in of the enzyme. So it's not only the reaction this is the key you know the basically. The enzyme is in activated. The droll so. This had found that youth. And one of the main disadvantage is. If you have an enter sign in present in the system. It can be pending on the structure of the end to cya and then it can. This color. The end to psion in and a very nice example. Our strawberries. If we add. So fight. To strawberries. You can see that the color has completely disappeared. And there are a number of other disadvantages. Which is that. At very high concentration of wealth. Of still five. We have flavor. Formation and. Fighting mean the one is being destroyed. But this happens only if every high concentration of cell five. So still five might be an egg. An active in. Inhibitor. Of the enzymatic browning reaction. But it also has some some side effects very have to take care of. So let's go to a question at which ph. Is still five. Most effective is it ph three opiate six. Well. The answer is b. eight six. Because at b. eight three. The sil fied is predominately present as. Sulfur dioxide which is full of tile. And basically disappears from the food. So the concentration of yourself fired. The creases. And then it's not active anymore. So. The most effective. B.h. are around in the neutral ph. B. and six b. at seven. To rev up. If you focus on still five. The mode of action is still fight. It inhibits the enzyme. And the other mode of action. Which also some tiles can have is that it reacts with key knowns. Circumventing the formation of dimas and all of my.",

                "text": "With this knowledge that i would like to dis discuss the control. And even the inhibition. Of enzymatic oxidation of phenolic compounds. And in particular. I want to dwell on the effect of environmentalists better meet us. Let's go to the enzymatic. Browning reaction. It's an enzymatic. Reaction. And it's a cascade of reaction just as a small rubber. Phenolic compound. We have the enzyme polyphenols. Days. In the presence of oxygen. It forms a key known. And he's keen on skin dime or eyes can form. All of them as in the end. And these problems have a brown color. Hence the name. And so i made the grounding. So how can we control. The enzymatic oxidation the first means by elimination of oxygen. The second one is reduction of the ph. And the third one is in activation of the enzyme. We have to take care that some of the enzymes are quite stable. And this heat stability. Depends on the source of the enzyme. So an enzyme in potato. Can we can have a different he stability then an enzyme in the in apple for example. So basically free. And fire mental power meters which influence. In some method. Running and how and. Bits gives also our for us possibility to inhibited elimination of one of the reactants oxygen. We diction of the ph so influencing the activity of the enzyme and he ration of the enzyme. Is basically also taking away. One of the essential steps in the browning reaction. So let's go to elimination of oxygen. Here we see. The the formation of a keen on compound. Oh yeah. We have the enzyme. And we need oxygen. So by simple. Taking away. Oxygen. One example is by immersing the food into a solvent. Into water for example. The oxygen level in water is much lower then than in in the air. So the air. So there is less oxygen present. Hence a lower reaction rate or. The use of oxygen scavengers. If we add them into a packaging material at etc. We have a lower oxygen content and. Like i said before. We have a lower rate of reaction. The other means. Is reduction of the ph. And here we have here is depicted. The difficulty of the p.p.o. enzyme from the fruit longer. As a function of ph. It's the ph. Optimum. So at which hope to be age. In the relatively short incubate in time. We see the maximal activity. And what is also depicted is the stability. So how stable is the enzyme for a prolonged. Time. At a certain at a certain b.h.. And what we see that in both situations. The ph. Optimum is around seven. If you go to higher ph. Drops. But obviously there are not many foods with ph higher than and then seven. But what's more interesting if you go to a lower ph. If you go to a ph of six. We have already. Half the activity. And if you go to a ph of four or below. The activity of the enzyme is completely ciro. So we have completely. Inhibited the enzyme reaction. Just by simple. Lowering the ph. So it's a very effective means to control. The enzymatic. The enzymatic browning reaction. The third. Means to control the enzymatic browning reaction is by an activation of the enzyme. Well let's first look at the activity down here of the enzyme so here. The enzyme is being. Incubated at different temperatures. And what we can. What we see is that the optimum temperature at which the. Enzyme is active. Is around thirty five degrees celsius and. We see a reduction of the activity. If we go to higher temperatures. So if in this case if we have sixty degree celsius. We see that the relative activity after a certain amount of time is only thirty percent of the maximum activity. Around thirty five degrees celsius. So basically it means that it's sixty degrees celsius we have heat. In activation. We have he'd been at a ration of the enzyme. So by just by subjecting the food. To an elevated temperature. Usually sixty degrees or higher. You get in activation of the enzyme. And then the further we inhibit the first step of the reaction. So we don't get any. Brown color he said and of the food anymore. So here we see. Another example of heat and an active face in what we see now this is this sweet potato. Here we have the stability concerns for for the police nor oxidase in. Sweet potato. And he we see some. Some difficult. Figures here we see the half time. So if it's sixty degrees celsius. We need. Ninety two minutes. Two in active fate. The enzymatic by fifty percent of its active. If you go to sixty five degrees celsius. It's fifty five minutes. And if you go to seventy five. It's ten minutes. Yeah. So it means. In this case. Ten minutes. At seventy five degrees. We have only. Reduced. The activity by by fifty percent. So this is a typical example of that some of these bodies and all oxidase. Are quite stable. So we should go. Even to higher temperatures than seventy five degrees. Boiling it's very often necessary for for a couple of minutes. So let's go to some questions. The first question is which creates would be optimal for inactive facia of the enzyme and of oxidase. And why is that ph not. Preferrable. So a low ph. Because we have seen that the enzyme stability is not high at the low ph. So a low ph. Heating at a low ph would be very effective. But it's not so. Not so. Optimal. Because at acidic ph and high temperature and also chemical reactions are occurring. And these chemical reactions. They can also lead to do the tradition of other products. Present in the food. So we might have circumvented the and some ethical today that we have course and. Another detrimental effect. Basically the chemical deprivation of other food constituents. So usually takes place at the neutral. Ph. To rev up and symmetric oxidation. Can be and he bit it. By changing the end for mental condition. Eliminate one of the reactance oxygen. Reduction of the p. eight. Very effective. And he you know to ration of the enzyme.",

                "text": "And it's not in this knowledge cliff i would like to discuss the issue of enzymatic drowning a phenomenon. Which is known to every one of us. And here we have some typical example. Bananas. Apple. But also in potato and many other food materials. So what does enzymatic browning. It's basically. It's the formation of brown colors but it's more than that open the formation of brown color as you also get a complex formation of protein and. From a can of a roma. Or taste compounds. So basically. And some i think browning. Is more than. Only the browning reaction. So let's have a look at the reaction. We start with a phenolic compound. And under the influence of an enzyme. Pollie from the. Oxy days. And this and sam contains a copper iron. So it's a. Redux reaction which is occurring. So under the influence of. The presence of oxygen. And by the enzyme. The phenolic compound. Is transferred into a key known. These key known. It's transferred into a dime or. Into an all of them are and. Eventually into polymers. If you go to the keno level. Keenan's are reactive species. And they can react with a minor way. As its presence in the food. And they could give a taste for example the taste of tea. If you have dimas and all of them are they already have a color. And they have an amber color. But they can also complex with proteins. And if the complexity of saliva proteins. We have. And this things and feeling in in our mouth. But they can but and if they could interact with proteins in foods. They can cause precipitation or if the protein and hence i am they can cause enzymes. The bishop. And the last step of their reaction. Either paul morse. The brown bomb or us. Usually insoluble. Brown pigments. Which gave the name. Due to this cascade of reactions. So let's look at the first step. Yet the formation of a keno. So we have a female. We have the enzyme. p.p.o. polyphenols oxidase. And it's being oxidised the two or aid groups are being oxidised. In what is called a key known moiety. So that's basically the first step. How do we then get from a key known to a dime or. So here we have the first step. The formation of a key known. This key known. Reacts with another female molecule which is present and. It forms a diner and basically a phenolic dimer because there is no. Keen on more u.t. in the phenolic dimer present. So that's the formation of the dime or. Let's go to the next step. The formation of all of them are well the first step in the formation of the overcomer is the oxidation. Of the dime or the phenolic diamond. You can see only from the female groups. Into a dime or which contains a key known moiety. And this is not caused by the enzyme. But this is caused by the presence of modern america keno and so the diameter of pheno. Is being oxidised. While the morning eric pheno. At the same time. Is being reduced into a female again and does so this then. The second step in there. In the cascade is a normal and symmetric reaction. And of course this pheno. If the enzyme is present. Will be oxidized into. Into i'm on american known. Again. So this is the first step. The oxidation of a dime or. So how do we get these all of them earth. Felt this is the picture here. The demurrage pheno. There. We have the diameter of a key known moiety. It reacts with a female. You get a tri meyrick structure. Only. Females. So only groups. This is being oxidised. By the key. By i'm on america so we get now a tri merrick structure with a key known. Once again it reacts with them on america pheno. We get a detrimental structure etc etc. And eventually we get polymers these brown polymer earth. So this is basically. This scheme. Of reaction for the end symmetric browning. So let's answer two questions. And the first question is some fluff a noise can be oxidized by police in aussie days. So what are the primary products. For formed after oxidation by police in all of the days and the second question is can. Pro and those sand indians of wheat this is this the model merrick structure and. Can they also be oxidized by police and or today's. Well i hope it's clear that the first primary products. Are key knowns. And water. And if you look at this molecule. At the basic structure of a program to sign and then sort of model merrick. Structure of a program to sign and then. We see that. To iraq seal groups who are present in an auto position. So next to each other so they can be oxidized in. So the answer is basically yes. So to summarize. It's important to mention is that enzymatic browning. Is a cascade of reaction. And that. The enzyme. Pollie from the auction days. Is the course of this oxidation so it's an symmetric oxidation. But it only starts with an enzymatic oxidation so. Only the first step. The oxidation of them on america female. Is caused by the enzyme. The rest of the reactions. Is basically a normal and symmetric process.",

                "text": "With this knowledge i would like to discuss some color properties of phenolic compounds. And i think i have the most typical example already in my hand. Of course everybody recognize the apple. But they can also see that we have a red color. And that we have a yellow color. And this color is being determined by phenolic compounds. If you go to the color of phenolic compounds and if you go to color in general. When do we see a color. If we have absorption of energy. In a certain area of waist length. And when this area is between three hundred eighty and seven thousand and fifty nine a meter. We observe a color. And this association. Is possible if there is a going you created a system of double bones. Of all the phenolic compounds that are the fluff annoyed. Who can have this. Property whether or not they have this property. That depends on their structure. And here to flatten noise are being depicted. One. A flat funnel. Has no corn you get it system. It has two separate. Female groups. And there is no corn you get that system. In the c. ring. While the other examples. A flip phone. Does havoc on your gated system. In the c. ring. So it has an extended gated system of double boards. And it has a color. Here. The five most important superclasses of the flesh noise are being depicted. And you can see the top three. Or have a double ball in the c. ring. So in the middle ring. Hence they have a color. And the lower two. They don't have a cone your gated system in the c. ring. So. So no color. The most pronounced. Example of a fluff and all fluff and odds which do have color and. They entered the ins. So the scientists and the sea and indians or their. Derivatives and josiah and ins. They often use in the food industry for their color properties. And what you can see here. Depending on the ph. You can see a whole spectrum of color. Ferrying from red to blue red at the ph two. And blue at alkaline conditions. And of course for most foods have a b. age. Ranging between four and six. So it's basically in this area. So the red color. Which for each and to sign and. Known for. So how is this possible this difference in color here we have the example of a three d. or the oxy. Undersigned. So end and then you have two ph equilibria. This is the fluffy eye and. It's positively charged. And when this charge. Depending on the ph. It's a just a simple ph equilibrium. Is lost then we have. We have this form. And then. At higher ph. One of the zero eight groups. Is being. Ionized. And then we go into the blue collar. So basically the differences in color which is which is on the slide. It's just of course by simple ph equilibria. And that we can also see in the in the next slide. This is a typical what we call it that ration. These are the two. Equilibrium constants. And what you can see. On the on the left. On the right hand side. You can see the wavelength. Of the different species. So the. Ionized form. At the higher. Wavelength. Hands. A more bluish color and. The proton a the form is more. More to a shorter wavelength and. A more. Reddish color. So here we see the effect of. B.h. on the color of the. Of the enter say in a dense. Oriental psion is meant to act like oscillated. But there is also another effect when we are dealing with foods. Of course in foods is a lot of water present and water. Has a detrimental effect on the color. And how is it possible that is because water gives in addition to the molecule. And it basically. It destroys the core new gated system which we get which is here depicted in the carbon no local base. It's just an addition of water to the molecule which destroys your gated system. This local base. Is in equilibrium. We have with an open structure which we call the cone. Which is which is yellow ways. But basically. Over time we loose. The rat or the fire. Fire that color. To to a color earth. System or. To a more yellow it system. But nature has protected. Has protected some some of it and the science. Against this water at that. So normally does. This is the way. The water i think. It takes on the sea to perception of the sea ring. You can see that if it's a nuclear filling tech. But if we now have a new gated system so. And when you get. It in this sense now means. If the end of santa didn't is like cause he laid it on the ship. On the sugar. Moiety he's your us and them it s. up there if it is one. One of the top and in this. This example dissing them it as a derivative. Is a coffee or we'll read you both on top and on the bottom and you can see that basically. Now. This area here. Is protected against nuclear filip attack by water. So basically we have three planers. Structure which we called stacking. And by this decking. We have. It's difficult for the water. To add to the molecule and hence the color is stable. This decking which stabilization of the core. We call. Kopechne inflation. And when it's done by the molecule itself. We call it. Mollica kolpak me. If you go to fairy. Alkaline conditions. Which are usually not. Not conditions present in food. But they could be in the preparation of food or the extraction of food ingredients. But if you go to ferry alkaline conditions. We also have a discoloration. And we have basically have. Deck radiation. Of the complete skeleton. What you can see here. And then eventually it ends up in an elder hide and a carpet seal it s. it. And we all know that these small molecules. Don't have a color. But this is only a very extreme. Alkaline conditions. And not a phenomenon. Off and assign a sigh and the ins is dead. They. When still fight is being added still far. Also this refers to the can you gated system which you can see here. There's still fight. Basically just like the what the water molecule. It adds to this sea to position here. And then. There is no can you get that system. Present anymore. And the most typical example of the effect of still fight. Is the addition of still five to strawberries. And here we see. The strawberry juice. On the left hand side just a strawberry strawberry used just off the preparation and. On the right hand side. We have added songs. Some still fight. And within seconds. You can see a complete. This colorization. Just by the mechanism i explained before. So to wrap up. A question. Sometimes muffins turned green. After baking. You know you can see here the example of a green muffin. Not very attractive. How can this be explained. Well the answer is. Once again we deal with say in a dense. And they are responsible for the color of blueberries press present in the fence. But if we add baking soda and baking soda. It's basically an alkaline compound. It changes the ph. So the ph. Increases. And we have seen that if the ph is high enough. We have a more a bluish or a greenish color. And that's what we observe here. So. Of all the phenolic compounds that are the fluff annoyed. Who are who do have a distinct color. And it's called the bends on the presence of the of a gated system in the ceiling and off the floor for now it's hard to say in advance. We have the most. Stink color properties. And this color property of the enter science science. Depends on the ph. And it depends on the presence of water. And as a last. Rep of the cone you gated system of a flat for a few meal. So the. Positive species. Of the end to saya scion in can be stepped stabilized by stacking. Of benzene rings. Which we call. Into armonica kopechne. They should.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I would like to discuss is a specific property of phenolic old bones. And that is the end the oxidant capacity. Which makes them. Natural and the ox in the presence in foods. And if you look at the. What's the diff capacity in foods. You know i gave an example of the inhibition of all of oil actually dacian by phenolic compounds. Present in the oil of oil and on the y. axis. It's the induction time to oxidation so when the oshie dacian starts. And on the x. axis. It's the gold band. Of phenolic called bonds. Also called phenols presence in the oil of oil. And what you can see is that the higher the content of phenolic compounds present in the all of the later. The oxidation. Starts. So the higher. The induction dime. So this. Typically gives the example that. They act with anti oxidants. So how do. Phenolic compounds. Act that antioxidants. They give. Basically they give up. And always group. For a radical. In oxidation. Radicals are present. And these radicals. Are being taken and are being taken up by the phenolic compound. At the cost of a hydrogen group. And then the phenolic compound itself becomes a radical but this radical can be stabilized and. By destabilisation. It becomes less reactive than the original or radical you know i have a typical example. Which is quest within. Question is if left or no. And it's a strong antioxidant. And why is it the stronger the oxidant it has several groups and it also has a key. No group. And they are pressing. They are capable of scavenging radical. So here you see also the example of. The stubbly cessation of a radical. Forward. For the credit in. Due to it's gone you gated system. The radical can be positioned on different locations within the molecule. And which lowers. Its reactivity. So hands. You stop. The oxidation. Activity. Oxidation actioned off. For example fifty as it's. So these antioxidants. What are the properties. Well. In foods. They can. They can be an antioxidant by. Because they are reducing agent. Of metal collating agents. Take it and. The radical scuffing which i just gave an example. But people. Consumption of foods with. Phenolic compounds which act as the oxidant. They can have potential health effects. And different health effects. Have been mentioned. But not all have been proven. But the ones which are which are being mentioned that they protect against cardiovascular diseases. And they also protect against certain forms of cancer. But once again. This potential health effects. They are not fully proven yet. In contrast to the oxidant activities which they exert in foods. So there are many kinds of phenolic compounds. And how how do and. How do all these phenolic compounds. How do they add up to the end the oxidant activity. Because there are difference of situations. And how important are all these. Difference of situations or first of all what is importance. The importance of an auto the hydroxy. Which means an auto the dropsy group. Means that up to i'd like to state your words. Position. Next to each other if that is present. That is important for the antioxidant. Capacity. The second one. If you have more hydroxyl groups. So here in this example. If you have one hundred more. Yes on the three four and five position. It's once again. It is stronger than only two groups are present. Another important. Moiety which we have already show for showing for the crits that they in if. Whether there is a double bond between the see two entities three. And the position of the kito group. Next to an oh wait. Here we already have this away group. And if you have an order always group in the. Close vicinity. It makes it even. Even a stronger n.t. antioxidant. A lot of left annoyed can be like oscillated. And the prime position of the glycol c. lation. Is on the c.c. position. That's this position here. And when this molecule is being related. It is it is not that antioxidant. Had not a high antioxidant capacity. When it's not like oscillated a six. Example is when we have bell weiss still substitution. On the a ring. If we have to say seven and eight. Or if we have to say sion five and eight. It makes it a strong antioxidant. And the last example is when we have the kito in no more u.t. here. Oh age group and he had a key to a group. It can binds to to a copper. To metal ion. And that and also it's also up to the oxidant. Properties. So let's finish this knowledge slip away from the question. And the question is which could. The following flatten out structure. In order of antioxidant strength. And it's a difficult question. And here is the answer. Well the one which is. Has the highest accident. Until after the strength. Its course it in. It has to avoid groups and it has to quito in no more u.t. here. The second one is written. It has two age groups. There's the kito group. But the weights group. Is being like oscillated. The third one. It's come for all. It has only one group. So no two ways group. Next to each other and a fourth one. It's little lynn. It does have two ways groups here. But it lacks the open station whether or not it like oscillated on the c.c. position. So this brings it from strong to weak. And the orcs. So of all the seven different rules. Yet. You can see that they intertwine. And that it's very difficult. To to put these molecules. Into. Into an order. Of antioxidant strength. So to wrap up for compounds a natural antioxidant. They have different functions in foods. And for the n.t.. If. Action though awaits group can end the oxidant is substituted for a free radical and. There is a relation between the structure. And the oxidant stress. Activity which is dominated by the presence of a way to groups and the kito in the old moiety present in some. Flashing lights.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip i would like to discus some properties of pull america from on a compound. Well. Let's first go to the classification a phenolic compound if i'm on america. Di merrick phenolic compound and the. Like america. Pull america. From a compound. Basically means. All of the american but and probably merrick more. And two rings. Which carry. And how to group. So examples are. The dense. Which can be classified into call then standings and hydrolyzed will tendons and ligaments. And what is the definition of a ten in the definition is. It's a naturally occurring. What a solvable. Plan phenolic compound. Which is able to form complexes. With proteins and alkaloids in a clear solution. And usually get have a molecular weight which is between five hundred and three thousand. So basically it's an operational definition. It's not a definition based on the only chemical structure. And like i said the classification is two and then stand ins. And then hydrolyzed about then and. If you go to the can then stents. They are present in many foods. Plant foods. And they are naturally occurring. All of the mayors of fluff and that's another name for then stand ins. Is pro end of scion events. And here we have the example of a flat funnel. So the basic skeleton of a pro and the sign in the in or a condensed then. He we have the zero eight groups. Present in the benzene ring. And the c. ring here. Coverage in a way to group. On the on the see three position here. And it has no double. Pulled in the ceiling. If you look. Come from the fluff and all. Into this little mess. You see that. They have a degree of polymerization. Ferrying between two and twenty. Which makes them. Condense tenants. And here we see. The structure. They are lined up. They have carbon carbon into linkages so they. And that brings into a moloch a weight. Ranging between five hundred and three thousand. If you look at the relative abundance of a d p one of the p. to the p two three etc. Which is the picture here for a number of plant grow materials for cinnamon. For cocoa and being processed into chocolate etc. And you can see that the risk for quite some variation. If you look into the granbury. You see that the majority of all the pro pro end of sign of things present in the granbury. It has a d p. Larger than ten. So then. Fluff annoyed. Structures. Linked to each other and that we also have other examples where because in the roasted peanuts. There is there is much more much more of a deep of a d p one. So the basic fluff and old structure. Actually we couldn't call it a pro enter sign and then just the model. Di merrick phenolic compound. So when we deal with pro enter sign of things. We deal with many different molecules. Ferrying in the degree of polymerization. So if you look at the abundance. You know if you add up all the pro and assign it in the different d.p.. You see here that in cranbrook. Already mentioned the. The example. Yeah. We have a very high content. Like in red wine. And in all of us i in bali and cereals to contend it's much. It's much lower. And content here is depicted on fresh weight a total parental science and milligram. Program. As best as well as in percentages. But one thing which should take care of that. It's very difficult to analyze all pro and to assign a dense. I've given the example of two d.p. of ten. If you have a higher degree. Degree of polymerization. We can't even. Extract them. So basically. The notion is that in our foods. There are more prone to sign a dense than which is currently being reported. The article also off tannins. Hydrolyzed able to enhance they are not present in foods. But they are present in in woody plants. Yeah it's also called. Sperms. And in some legumes. They are. They are present in low quantities. It's a problem or. Of gallic s. it and. Electric as it so you can see immediately and that they are phenolic compounds. And which is which is in the link which are in the link. By a second right. A clue goes. Moiety. In the middle. Which is substituted by these mono meric phenolic. Compounds. Into into. Into an all or go merrick phenolic structure. If you look at the properties and then. I stick to the can then stand ins because the hydrolyzed of both ends are hardly present in. Foods. If you look to the can then tendency in food to properties. They can interact with protein. They can bind to protein. Causing insoluble particles or partly. Installable particles which. Which form a haste. They can also. If the enzyme. Enzyme our present enzymes are proteins. If they bind to an enzyme in active. The enzyme. They can interact. If saliva proteins in our mouth. And then they get the they call course stringency. And they can also diminish the digestibility of all the food components are present. Present in the food. Used by by called lex ate into food proteins which can federal not be digested by digestive enzymes. A very particular property of condensed tendons in food if they can decompose. Ople heating in an acidic. Condition. And then. And to say in a dense i'll be being formed. And that is the name. Basically the name to the pro and to us and indians. Because in the past they thought they were the precursor of the end to us an event which is that which is not the. Not the case. So opal heating and the say end of the ends are being formed into the say in a dense have a color. And here you can see that in this case. Imperious in certain psoriatics of piers. If you if you boil these piers piers are a bit. Citic then heating for a prolonged time. You get this. Wrecked quality station of b.s.. Which is so typical for death for this riot. And what happens on the chemical bases. Is that the pro and the scion and in. Open heat and and as it is being called for food it. Into an endo say in addition with. Also some other molecules being present. The order. Polymeric from all the. And. Which we should describe. Is lignin. And lignin. Is part of the cell wall of many planned. Plant materials. It's one of the most abundant plant materials. And it's a polymer consisting of monomers with. Finial propane. Skeleton. So a c six. C three. So once again a phenolic compound. One of the properties. It limits the digestibility of plants health is a rather inert. And. Because it's present in the plant cell wall. To the lake no cellulose network. And here we see the structure of the lignin. You can see that it's in. Enormous complex. And when you look carefully at the gold next you can see the building blocks. And the building blocks. Are particle more real alcohol. Kone for all. And seen the pure hope. Which are all interlinked. Into a large. Molecular structure which gave stability to to the plant cell walls. So let's finish this. Not a clip. With a question that tenants are used in the letter industry. To buy into protein molecules. To form a network. And by this confers. The skin will get the letter properties. So now let's go to food. Explain how this property of tenant. Can be in this science. During and symmetric processing. Of foods. For example making a protein. High roller skate. Well the answer is that these tendons just like they bind. To the proteins present in the skin. In the letter industry. They can also bind. To the enzymes which are also protein. And when they bind. The enzyme is not active any. And they can even cause a precipitation. Of the enzyme to get over with the ten in and makes an end as the end cement the conversion. So to wrap up america for not a compound they can be simplified into tendons and ligaments the tendons can be subdivided into can then stand ins which we also call enter sign and thence. Those are mostly present day foods. The other class of tenants are hydrolyzed built ins and they are usually not present their food. The present the normal foods like woody materials. The lignin foods. Is usually a low listening content. And products with a high level of content are usually. Non-food materials. Like wheat straw. And once again also woody material.",

                "text": "With this knowledge clip i would like to discuss some properties of money america and i'm eric phenolic compounds. Well he's not america and i'm eric from not a cold bones. They are a part of all fanatical bonds and. The phenolic compound speak less if i into the moment i want to die merrick wants into the all or all of america. Or pull america once the monomaniac once. One benzene ring. With in a way to group. The diameter of one. Obviously you have two benzene rings or both. We will discuss. One example hydroxy said them i guess it's and deflect annoyance. So let's go to the of and then i guess it's. This is the structure of cinema guess it has a benzene ring. Lets an alley fed take and set your rated early phytic ching. It contains no hydroxyl groups. So basically it's not the phenolic. The hydroxyzine they make as it contains. Good things one group makes it the phenolic. One or two always groups. Which obviously also makes its phenolic. And then there are two groups present with the name for this compound is a fake as if and when one is present. It's called myrick acid. So these are high hydroxy send them i guess it's. And if you go to the hydroxy phonetic as a derivatives. We see. He had the example of for all of s. it. Where one of the away group. Is medieval history fight. But it still contains one awake group. So it's a had. It's a familiar. Phenolic compound. Another example of a hundred she said then i said there if it is as it and know the way it's groups. The benzene ring. They are. I'm not there if it dies. But it's the carbon. Seal group. In the elephant to change its give name. The essid name to sing the mc as it. Or for a look as it is being as terrified. In this day. In this case doing. Kinnick as it. Molecule. To to form. The compound glora jeana guess it. And please pay attention. In laura gina guesses that this is the female moiety. And this is not a female moiety because it doesn't contain a benzene ring. It just contain a normal. Six ring. So hydroxyzine them i guess at the risk that if they are present. As free molecules in apples and in order. And in order fruits. They are present. As an ester bound to mono. All of us. And here we have the example of a sin never seen them again said the reflective. Bound to one unit and they can also bind. To police eg arrives. For example in wheat or rabbinic silence. Here we have to be no silent. To police the police at the right chains and. Between the polysaccharides. There is a further look as it either. Singly attached or. In the other example where the other two examples where it's being cross-linked. So what are the properties of hydroxy phonetic as it's. Well. On the one but peculiar property. Is that it binds to metal iron. And when it binds to a metal ion. So here we have seen it as it. The example i gave before. And we have the two plus. And when they are in close contact. And i ring nate. Complex is being found. Being being formed and and weak. We got this. This stable complex. Well if he nordine gas it or gloriously nate is present in potatoes and just. After the harvesting of potato. The irony present in the potato is being bound to sit as it to decide rate to be any only form of side trade. This complex. Is colorless. And if you cook. Potatoes just after the harvesting. We don't see a discovery as colorization. But the bone storage of the potato so at the end of the season. There is no side trade. Left. The side rate is all. Metabolized. And then the iron. Complex a tz with. Gloria gloria jean eight. To form a black. Complex. And this black complex we call off the cooking darkening. And you can see this here. That now we have these dark spots. Which we typically. For the iran glory complex. But probably the most important property. Of had rocks and emic asit in foods. Is they are a perfect substrate. For enzymatic oxidation. And enzymatic oxidation is called is caused by the enzyme days. Oxidize the overweights groups. Present in a phenolic compound. It oxidizes to. A key known moiety and. Once this is being. Oxidize. This molecule polarizes. Into brown pigments. What you can see here for the apple being depicted. So let's go to the article after the di merrick loss of fluff annoyed and. Ice of laughing eyes. They both have a c. six. C. three. Six. Structure that to see six. Structures. They are the benzene group. And the c three. Is the elephant the chain. And this c. three forms. C. ring of fire and c. ring. Which is oxidized. In the middle. And it forms now. Three ring structure. Two benzene groups. Into link with b. if they have another ring which we call the c. ring. So this is a flat annoyed and he can see once again. Three rings. But the ring is positioned on another position then than in the flesh annoyed. And then we call it an ice of leaven oid. Well let's continue with the fluff annoyed. There are many. Supply office. Are flashing lights. And the five most important subclasses. Are being depicted here is the flip phone calls the flip phones. If left funnels. And the flat unknowns. And the enter science. And what you can see is that all these five. superclasses they differ. In the substitution. But also in the oxidation level of the c. ring. You know whether or not a double bond is being present. Or whether or not and always group or a ketone as being present. So he's left annoyed they occur. Free to sugars and they occur in many plants. And they have a natural function in plants. They protect against you feel light. But they're also important. Like even color to a flat annoyed. To attract insects or birds. If you look now to the properties in foods. Well. In foods once consumed when the food is being consumed. They can have a biological property in our body. For example estrogen. Estrogen a city in the example of ice have less noise. But in the food they can all. So act as an antioxidant. They can give color to foods. Like in like an apples or like it like in a strawberry. But also what is important is they are a substrate too and some ethic oxidation to the typical brown color in our foods. So these phenolic annoyance. They can be present in the free form. Which we call and i like them or they can be form present in the bound form. It's like oscillated form. In the free form. They are usually not very. Water soluble at polar groups. The sugar moiety. To deflect annoyed. Skeleton. And they increase the sole ability. But if you look at the five glasses flatten olds flat phones. And so say in a dense and flattened ols they are mostly. Like oscillated. While one group. The flat funnel. Of which they get to is an important example. They are mostly like oscillated. If you're talking about. Sides. We also have to discuss the nomenclature. If no more eighty's is present. And here we have the example of the end. And those signs and the sign indians. If milk sugar moiety is present. We call it an endo say any din. And went to the end though saying he did in a second right is being added. We call the molecule. I'd like to side of course. But the name of the molecule is the end of scion in. So this might be confusing. But basically it's simple. The bigger the molecule the shorter the name. It's a very easy rule of thumb. So. Like a side of like a side at to the sole ability. And these molecules the enter say and it in. And also the enter psion into the number like oscillated forms. They give. Color. Especially color to fruits and flowers. So let's answer some questions. Which of the following. Structures are one hundred. And then i guess in the receptive. If life annoyed or act like a side. The first one. But that's typically. The structure of the hydroxyzine and i guess if there is at this and in this case it's true i guess it. It's one of the group of a fake as it is being the deal as thirty five. But it still contains and always group. The second one. It's a flat annoyed. But it's also a blank aside because there are two super units at that. And it's never been in it's present. It's present in origin. And it's a fluff annoyed. Like zero site. And the last. Example. It's also of left annoyed. It's something to do away to groups. In this case. On the. On the dial group. And basically. In this example. There are always groups. On the benzene ring. And not the big hit but in press and in presence. This molecule. Contains a number of always groups. So let's wrap up. The basic skeleton of a phenolic compound it's a benzene group. Personal age group classification and mono. Die and die merica. Mono and different from the walls. Is based on the number of benzene rings and two important. Examples of the mono and dive. Di merrick phenolic. And then i guess it's flashing lights. And when we talk about it like oh side. It means that the phenolic compound. Is bound to wish you good moiety either present there's a motorcycle ride or a di cicco ride or a pulley second right.",

                "text": "In this clip. I would like to give you an introduction to. Phenolic compound. Phenolic compounds are present in many foods. And especially plant foods. So my samples they are present in berries. They are present in tea. They are present in red wine. And not only. Present in foods but they also present in your own foods. For example they are present to a large extent in. Increase. And the example. I have also here on the table. Which is a banana. Which are coffee and way to apples. And you can already see there are a lot of names on the slide. And in total there are more than ten thousand species. Of phenolic compounds. So why are phenolic compounds important. Well they provide color. They provide the color to this apple. They can cause browning reactions. The brown color of this banana. Is caused by phenolic. Compound. But they can also have an effect on taste. They can. Complex age with proteins or saliva proteins. And they gave in estranging feeling on our own when we when we taste. T.. Talking about taste. They can also gave a special. Taste to two foods when they are being heated. And also they have. And the ox of the different properties in foods. And these. Same same and the ox or the if affects. Can also be excluded when we consume the phenolic compounds when you consume the foods. In our body. So let's go to the basic skeleton. How are familiar compounds being defined. They are defined as compounds which have a benzene ring and hydroxyl group. And he you see the example. On the screen. But it's not only groups. These hydroxyl groups. There's not only one. There can be multiple hundred groups they can be chains. Attached to this group. And they can also be more bent more than one benzine group. Until now i've used the words. Phenolic compound. But there are also other names like bully females. Or phenolics. And these three names are all used for the same class of substances. So my sample of phenolic compounds. The first one is a fake s. it. A benzene ring. If. Hydroxyl groups. And an elephant the king. Can fake as it. The next example is anthocyanin then you can see two. Benzene rings michel interlinked. And the third example is the lignin. Less and in three days. You can see that. Quite a number of. Benzene rings. So the phenolic compounds they are present in many plants and they are usually. Present in minor. Quantities in foods or agriculture role materials. But there are so make sessions. Well let's go to the abundance of. Usually they are present. One to two percent. On dry weight. Basis. Like in most fruits. I can. But they tow. Or cereals. But there are a number of exceptions. And which they constitute a major. Proportion of the total dry weight. Like in coffee. Like in cocoa. While i can see. So how do we classify all these ten thousand different species. Well basically we classify them. On the carbon skeleton. And within this. We have division in three different groups which are mono meric phenolic compound having only one benzene group. Like the simple females. Had roxy been so i guess it's or. They had rocks in then i guess it's. Phenolic compounds which have to benzene rings. Like the still being. The fluff annoyed. Or the ligaments and phenolic compounds which have more than two. Benzene rings. Like the lick needs or the condensed tenants and even the hydra lies about tenet. But there's another. Distinction. In the classification of phenolics they can be present as free components. Or they can be present in a bound form that they are bound to order food constituents. So let's go to the example here we have the example of granbury. You can already see the cranberries contains a lot of phenolic compounds. But what's important now that most of these phenolic compounds. Are present as free. In the brown bar. As free components and only a minor proportion is bound. The opposite is for corn wheat oats and rice. So the lower four bars where the majority of the phenolic compounds are bound to water. Constituents. And in this case it's the forty second writes. Well if you now look on the intake often all the compounds in our diets. I have. I give you here the example of the intake of phenolic compounds. Of a spanish population over a five year period. And you can see that most of the. Phenolic compound. Intake. Is caused by consumption of fruit. Next it's known as cold beverages festivals. Alcoholic beverages. And then we go to the cereals to the oils. Cocoa products or nuts and seeds. If you look at what. Of phenolic compounds are consumed the majority of the flesh annoyed. Then the hydroxy should then make their if it as a derivative of scion indians. Which are ten and. And then they had dropsy benzoate as it's still being. Etc. So this brings me to a number of questions. So which other. Of the food products. Contain phenolic compounds which are shown here. The apple. The ag. The nuts. The wheat or the meat. Well it's basically the plant foods. Phenolic. Compounds. Are present in plant foods. And they are hardly present in animal foods of animal. Origin. The next question. Which of these five structures. Are phenolic compounds. Let's go to the first one. It's a bend. Then the reflective. Is no. Phenolic compound. As it doesn't contain a free iraq seal group. If the group. If he would be a free hydroxyl group. Then automatically it would have been fanatical about that in this case. It isn't. The second example. It's going to fear oh yes it is a phenolic compound. It gone things have been seen ring close. And i don't feel group attached to it. The third one. Might be a tricky one. You might recognize it. It's in a minor as it's the a minor as it tyrus in. And we call it in a minor as it. But if you have a close look at the structure. We see that it contains a benzene ring with a no age group. So basically it's a phenolic compound. And it acts like a fanatical bond. Although we don't always mention in the film a combo of the basically we shoot. The fourth example. It's a fluff annoyed that it. It has. It has two benzene rings. And on each of them in the ring there's a. There's at least one always group. So it's a familiar compound. And the fifth example. It's a head roxy's and then we get said the refit if. And once again. Beds in ring. There's two ways group. So basically when there is a. Benzene ring present before freo age group. Then we should call it a phenolic compound. Those are so to summarise phenolic compounds. Mostly minor components. In many plant foods. And in some cases. They are present in large quantities. Like in tea. They influence the product. A product or a sticks. And because of this high number we classify them. And we classify them on the basis of the carbon skeleton.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I'm going to talk about the functional properties of pull the sec writes. I think for example of jam. Jam is a gel product. In which the packed in that comes from the fruit or that has been added to the jam gives a gel in the. Jam and that is why the jam has a certain structure. Or more products that contain police like rights that give structure to the product and it's in there for thickening. Or for juggling in the product. Talked about the jam. But also to soups. Or to puttings very often the starches added to make it thicken. And if you think of licorice that licorice often contains also starch. But also. For example gum or wrapping that kill so it gives a kind of chewy structure tooted licorice and maybe you've never thought of chocolate milk. To cocoa particles and a chocolate. Would normally struggle to the bottom. And to prevent this. Chocolate milk is produced by adding a carrot gene and a carrot gene and makes a very thin gel. In the chocolate milk. That keeps the cocoa particles in the chocolate milk. So in this knowledge clip. I will talk about. Jelling. And fish this cost by police acker right. Now let's first start with fisk what is for scottie scottie means the resistance to flow. And here i show you. A difference in resistance to flow to the left. Liquid here. Has almost no resistance to flow and that's why it just flows out of to tube and. So it has a very low viscosity now hired if this cause a t.. The hired a resistance to flow. When you try to have a product. Flow. How does that work with police like arrives here you see for police rights and let's say that they are in solution. And when they are in the solution. They take up a certain space. And of course they move around thirty not just tilled that they move around a little bit. Maybe a few. They start to move more and more not. I show you that with like them turning around showing you what space to take up. And if you look at that very very clear do you see that these molecules come into each other space when they move around. So if you make a round. Around. Each molecule you see that they take up each other space. Now if molecules to dad. Than the fiscal city increases. Not a few properties factors that influence fists custody of police check rides. Are to following. The confirmation of the mono sect writes in the poll emerge. Can have an influence whether it's an alpha or a be attacking for mission. Also the branching pattern. If you have many or few branches can have an influence. Also a degree of problem every station. The d.p.. How many moment meric units do i have in the police i can write. Can have an influence on this constitution. And on that last i mentioned a charge group. Whether door charge groups or how does that work how does that influence for scotty. Let's start with the first one. Here you see a molecule where all alpha link itches. And here is a molecule would be to link which is an example is that it would be salad lows. And this would be starch. A son of those much more rigid. So it has a very rich a molecule in that rich of molecule takes up quite a lot of space. Well starch molecules much more flexible because of that alpha. Bond. And for that. It's more flexible takes up less space. So it has a lower viscosity. Now comparing the branching. If you have a lot of branching then the molecule becomes more compact. So it takes up less space. If you have only one branch or no branches. Than the molecule can be more open and take up more space. So have a higher fist cos it's. When comparing two molecules. Would a different degree of polarization you can imagine that a smaller. Molecule takes up much less space than a bigger molecule. Meaning to smaller molecule would give lower viscosity than a bigger molecule. And on that last i'm comparing a molecule with no charges. To a molecule that has charges. Here you see you run it acids. These are sugar units that. Instead of the normal or h. group at the six carbon. Now that's six. Carbon. Has become an acid group. So this is your own like acid and ass of groups. As you know. Can have a charge depending on the p. h.. So here you have a negative charge and here you have a negative charge at south right now molecules which charges. Repel each other. Mean that they even take up more space than if they would not repel each other so this will give. Even a higher viscosity. That was about physical city. Now let's talk about jellyfish. What is jellyfish in. If you talk about a gel the gel definition would be that they're jealous of three d. notwork. That can retain water. And here i show you an example of a gel. Here you see the the police cycle right. Making connections with each other. And by dad they make a three d. network. And within the three d. network. The police like to write. Can retain the water or the liquid. And that is how we make a gel. I hear you see different examples of how different police act rights can make different kind of. Gels. They can really make a branching point. There are definite connections with each other it can also be just an attraction of two political rights at a track each other here the junction zones are really crystalline so it's really strong bonds. And here. The molecules. Round. Around each other making helix. So there are different possibilities. For police to make structures. Not really learned about fisk also t.n. about jill lieschen. And. Now if you can tell me which of these molecules will give a higher fiscal city so compare this. Solution containing these molecules with this. Solution containing these molecules. And compared this one with that one and. That one with that one. Which of the two. Will give a higher fist called city and solution. But here are the answers. Because of the charge that is on this molecule. The molecule. Will repel other molecules sort it will take up more space than a molecule that has no charge. When we look at. Molecules that have a same degree of polymer recession. As i sat here. But then this one is more rigid. And this one is more flexible. The flexible molecule will take up less space will have a lower physical city. And then here i have two molecules with the same degree of polarization. But then this one has no branching and this one has branching. And because of the branching it takes up less space. So this one here will have a lower viscosity. So to summarize. I've talked about the functional properties of police act right. Now police like rights can give this cause a t.. And this is called. Caused by the movement of the molecule that causes friction between molecules. Also police act rights can be used to make a gel. Than the gel. The. The police doctor writes make and that's worked with each other that converts water. And all these properties depends on the structural and again mccoll correct three strikes of the police act right.",

                "text": "And there's not much clip. I'm going to talk about starch. Now starch is a very important pulley cycle right that is present in many food products. Think of flour that this made of wheat. Of which we make pasta. All of its presence and potatoes and rice. And it's present in corn for treme corn starch. Not starch. An important source for us humans. Because we eat a lot of these products. And most of the starches degradable but some of the starches not to create a bill and then it acts as a fiber. Our starches present in cells in. Starch granules. And here you see a few different starts granules from the different sources and. Important to see is that potato for example has pretty big. Starch granules friend you for example compare it to rice which have much smaller starch granules starches present in the start granules. Into different kind of molecules which we call a loss and. A mile of pectin. And the difference between those two is that there's a linear molecule. While. Amala pectin is a branch molecule. And when it's present induce farge granules it's not present as. Just a very rigid linear structure. But it's actually present as a helix. In the starch granules. I hear you see a little bit more detail of that structure if we look at amarillo stand you see that it's all glucose units and it's. Alpha glucose has connected to each other by a one for linkage. So the it so one. Car. The first carbon of one glucose is connected to the fourth carbon. Of the second because unit. Of this is i'm a little so the linear part of. Starch. But if you look at a model of pectin. Then it's very branched. And. Yeah it's. Pretty big molecule so i'm going to zoom in that one little part here. So look at the branch point. And if you look at the branch point thing you see that you have the linear parts. Are still one for linked. But the branch parts are linked by a one sixth bond so it's the first carbon of this clue close. Link to the. Six carbon. Of that other glucose molecule. If you look at the different sources for example potato or we or corn or top yokota. Than we look at to them i mean those are a mite of pectin composition. Than you see that is almost always there for about twenty five percent. While the i'm on the packed in is. It's there for about seventy five percent. So there is more on my look packed than press and. Granules. Than. That there is a middle. Also if you look at to grio polymerization done. Much smaller it's about a round. Thousand to close units connected to each other while for a model a pact and. It's two times. Ten to the power of. Six. So it's. At least a thousand times bigger than an molecule. If you look in the starch granule how are do you. I mean listen i'm out of packed in suppressant. And what you see here is for example here we have a few. I mean lohse parts. Smaller molecules. But most of it it's the big a mile of pectin molecules larger molecules. But the branch point. And they're in a specific structural. Position in the. Starch granule precedent. About. If we heat up a starch solution. And something happens through our solution. And before i'm going to show you about this class. This. Gelatin is station. I first want to show you what happens to. If you add starch to cold water. Now here we have the corn starch. And the corn starch. Here i have some cold water. If i add. The coal cornstarch. To it of cold water. Than you can see that. I can stare for a very long time. But it will not the self that gift this milky color. Because now we have a lot of starch granules. And the starch granules won't dissolve into the cold water. So how to got starches dissolved in water. What you have to do is heat up the starch solution. Or discard suspension have to say it's not a solution yet. So we start here. If you look at the graph. Than. We start at this point here. And it's cold temperatures. Room temperature. And we're going to heat up the starch suspension. And at a certain point in time where heating heating heating when reach around. Let's say it depends on the start but when it is around sixty degree celsius. Then at that point. The fists koschitzke which is on the y. axis. The fisc us cities going up. And this is because discharged run you'll start to swell. They start to take up water. This. First point here where their fists constitute is clearly going up. We call that the gelatin association temperature. You keep on warming up to keep them warming up so discharge granule start to swell more and more and more and more. Until they reach their. Their highest point in this cause a team of this point is called to peak physical city. And in between the polarization cross that you can see if you look at ground rules for it's a polarization filtered through a microscope. That polarization cross will be lost. Over. Time now for we keep on warming up. So we've reached the peak fiske us a team we keep on warming that at a certain point the granules will break apart. And when they break apart. We will loose fiscal city. So because of that of his costa two will go down. And we will get slowly built that we will separate. I'm a lowe's and pectin molecules. Now. I've did that for you. So if you look at the. Two samples here. Than this is the sample in which i try to dissolve the starch. But it's not working it's still it's in cold water. It's still very white not heated it up. And it became thick. It's much thicker. And it became more clear meaning that. I'm a lowe's and i'm ella packed and molecules are now dissolved. If i compare that to the suspension yeah. It's not dissolved. So there is no fiscal city here. Not free made. The starch solution. After gelatin station. And we leave it up room temperature. That has a certain point ritual. Read ation is starting to take place. And this means that if it's cause a tea later on. Increases again. Because discharge molecules that were first in solution. Start to connect again. With each other and this is it ever first simple reaction. If we use starch in the food industry. Because we need to heat the starch etc. Well. Very often this used in the food industry is modified starch. And we can modify starch in different ways. Now one way is by physical modification. First heat up. The starch solution. Very slowly and dry it again. And then you get a powder which we call an instant torch. Because we've been. It has been heated. It is already gelatin nights. So discharge that is produced out of this. Can be added to cold water. And the soles. Radley. In cold water instead of first needing to heat it again. Another way of modification is. By hydrolyzed. So for. First the starch solution is made. The starches hydrolyzed and on it's dried again. And then this. Starch if we add that to a food product. It will give a much lower fish custody because the kill so. Are much smaller. After modification. Because of the hydrolysis. A third way of modifying starch. Is by linking the starch molecules to each other so the cross-link starch. If we add that to the food product which is for example. A lot like a soup. Than. This cross-link starch will stay much more stable. In the food product. Than if it would not be crossed linked. And then afforded way of modification is by substituting discharge. If you substitute to starch molecules. Than reacher a gradation will not take place. That easy meaning. Richard ation is that the starch molecules come back together again after this whole thing. And because of the substitutions. It's harder for starch molecules to come together again to reach rogue radiation will be the last taking place now. I'm floored a lot about starch. And i have a question here for you. So we made to start solution. And we are cooling at the. After gelatin station. And then reach record ation will start place. At room temperature. I hear you have the curve. That we looked at before. So you have to gelatin initiation curve. And if this cost of tea is now higher before. After john it's initiation compared to before gelatin a station. But what now if you complete this curve. For ritual gradation how will that look like complete the curve. Now here you have the answer. Reacher of predation means that starch molecules. Start to connect to chop with each other a little bit. And because of that. The fish causes he is going up again. So after some time. You will slowly see an increase again. Of the physicality. And it really depends on what kind of starch that we have and also the concentration of the starch. How height of his cost of tea will be. After ritual predation. So to summarize. We've talked about starch. Starch is a combination of. I'm a loss and a mile of pectin. It's present in the in the sources and starch drawn urals. If you heat up the starch granules. They will start to add gelatin ice. So it means that the the starch granules will fall apart. And then the starch molecules will dissolve into water. And if you modify the starch then this starch. Will have very different properties than before modification.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I'm going to talk about the classification of police sector rights. A police check rides a large molecules meaning you have many monomers. In one big molecule. Maybe you know starch and potatoes. But except of starch there is also a cell wall around each cell containing packed in and silos which are also pulled the second writes that a classification can be based on two different types. And one classification type is looking at what kind of monocycle rights are in the police records. Police like rights for example here you have a few examples like. Carriage ina or pectin starch or a car or cellulose that have different monocycle rights. In their composition. If you look at carriage enon they have. And he drove. If you look at packed in it had all kind of difference. And if you look at starch. It only has glucose. And if you look at gaar than it has the same as the ones. From carriage enon. But then the little bit different. And if you look at salad. It also looks almost the same as starch but then. Here you have an alpha and here you have a beta. So based on the monocycle right composition. You can tell which kind of police factor right you have. They are present at all kind of different products. For example kyra genes are used in chocolate milk. To keep the cocoa particles in the chocolate. Not to resist. Not a way of classification. And that is looking at whether to police like to write as a home of lichen. Or a he took like. What is the difference a whole month like in means that you have only one type of unit. While for a he trunk like and you can have two or more types of humans. Not if i divide up the whole milk like. Then you can see that you can divide them up and. To a linear or a branched like and i here you see you have the same units next to each other or you have the same unit. But then. A branch point in the right. When we talk about to heathrow gleick and. We can make up the same division. You can have a gun. And when you're a teacher of lichens so you have for example. Glucose for glucose fructose next to each other or. A branched. He's roguelike can. Meaning that you have branch points in the heat like a molecule. But it's a trick like and so you have different kind of humans in here. So here is an example of heatstroke lichen. Which is also a branch this. Example of a pectin molecule. And although it is much larger than i show you here. It shows you that it has a very complex composition. It has branched particles on one side. That it has a more home old lichen part in the middle. It can have other kind of branches. But it's definitely a he took lichen. And it's definitely branched. Not there is another way of classifying pully cycle rites and that is by looking at its biological function. And you can have storage police check rights which of starch is a very good example it's really used for storage in the plant for us and energy sorts later when the seats are growing again. Or it can be a plant so will police like right. Then it gives structure to the cell wall. Silos impact and the main rights and the cell wall. You can also have pull the second rights and connective tissue. Kicked in it's a good example of that. And it's part of for example shrimp. And then that you have bacterial polish like rights and these are mainly to polish that bacteria will make. In food proto. Thinks of. Police like rights that are producing yogurts. And knocks on tongues as an example of a bacterial. Political right. And then you have police like the rights that are couple to another molecule for example. Couple to approaching them we call it a glycoprotein or. A glycol pep tight. Now. We've looked at different kind of classifications. And here you have a starch. Composition. Starches made out of two different molecules down here. And i'm all opec to act and appear. My question is a starch a whole monk like an aura heatstroke lichen and starch branched or linear. And if you look at the likeness of the linkages are they all the same and starch and explain this. So to give you the answer first of all. If you look at the second right sort of units that are present in the two starts molecules. You can see that it's all made up of the same. Monomer. And in this case it's only glucose monomers. So it's a whole month like. Second of all. You see that this molecule here. The. Linear. But packed in has a branch point here. So it's both. Linear and. Branched. And starch. And then the third question here. Do they have the same link which is not the linear part. All have a one for linkage. So the first carbon here is connected two to one two three four it's carbon. On the other morning the second right. While for the branch point. It is the first carbon. Of this muslim are connected two to one two three four five six carbon. Of the other moment. So it's a one six. Linkage. Sort or two type of link a chess. Press and starch. So to summarize. I've talked about the classification of different police rights and you can base that on the structural properties so about her it's a whole. Like an aura heatstroke like a no whether it's linear or a branch. Now you can also based on the biological function so. It's a storage. Polish like right or a cell wall police aykroyd etc.",

The oxidation. Of polian said to read fit the essence and character no it's. This real cause. Oxidative rancidity. So it's an interest reaction. Usually by proxy you know it's present in various bins p.c.'s for example in soybean. So how does this oxidation affect the s it works. For example. If we start with this fifty s it's in the present. Off an oxygen molecule. We can get. And the influence of this life oxygenates. We can get this primary. Oxidation products. So for example. Depicted here. Which is an in-state hydro parasites. And this is in stable hard repaired sides. Will lead to follow up reaction fairly fast. Because they are not stable. And his follow up reaction. For example we can get this. Hydro parasites convert that very fast. Into this secondary. Oxidation products. And they lead to this oxidative friend said it's because the properties of this secondary oxidation products. Say the t.. Not what we want. Usually in a product. The negative effects therefore. Are a loss of nutritional value. We can have a loss of color. And as i said. The formation of rancid compounds. We also have a couple of positive effects. Because some of the compounds forms. Belong to a wisht flavor. Components for example that instead the rate of. L. the highs and ketones. And sometimes. We would like to bleed such natural pigments. For example if we do not want an orange color. Like in a weed flower. We'd like. We would like to bleach out. This car to know we'd still have our nice. White flour. Now the question for you. What can be a measure of life oxygenates activity. And another question. Can you explain the difference between a lie pace and a life oxygen ace. Well the answer on the first question. Is the consumption of oxygen. Because it is an. Oxidative enzyme. It needs oxygen. To be active. And the difference between a lie based on a lie box he denies all the lie pace's belong to the enzyme class. Of hybrid lasers. So hide relates. And the like proxy d.n.a. d.n.a. says belongs to the oxy the red of tasers. And the not a difference is that lie paces cleef. esteban's. And the life oxygenates us uses. Oxygen and oxygen to the fifty s. and forming in stable hydro parasites and secondary. Products later on. So to summarize my props to do an ace is an oxygen. Consuming. Oxy direct tace. For example. It's. Transforms to sis one. For ten thirty a.m. system in fed the s. it's. Into hydro parasites. Which are in stable. A negative aspect is that this course. Oxidative rancidity to rent city of our threats. Which is in waste. And a positive aspect this we can make use of life oxygen ace's for example. For bleaching. And to get some wisht flavoring.

                "text": "Welcome to this knowledge clip. About life basis. Lie paces. Belong to the class. Of the hydra laces and to be more specific. They are. Esther this. Ly basis. I do realize. Lip it's our orals. Most of the ly paces are positions specific. Which i will explain in this knowledge clip. And they get activated. Especially on oil water. Interfaces. To understand. The action of live paces. You first need to understand the structure of a triglycerides or an oil. So to say this drag lies or it is build from right where the dice roll. Which has in this case. Three fifty s a tails. One without double bones and here. With double bones. A palm activity. Of a line pace. We can't leave off. All the three sets yes it's. And we have the glass roll as well as a product. So as i said most of the lie paces. Are position specific and. To be more precise. They are three specific. This one and three numbering. Relates to the position of the fifty s. it. On the glass roll molecules. So from the top to the bottom. It's one two or three. So my examples are present in the pancreas. Or several microbial my pieces. Next to this is just a physically pays its we also have nonspecific life. Basis. And in this case. These enzymes do not distinguish which for the essence they cleave off the first can be either one or two or three. Or the other way around. So. This lie paces can hydrolyzed it's according to the want three specific reaction. If we start from this molecule. Where we have one two. And the three fifty s it's presented over here. The first step. Of this one. Three specific lie paces. Is a fast and it's can i go here. To the left. We can't leave off. Here the first thirty s. it. Or on the other sides. Can also be fast on the. Three position. So what we have left. As a substrate. In this case is a two to three d. class rights and. Any other case we have a want to write. The second step is a bit slower and depending from which side we come. It cleaves off the wall. Ordered three. Positions fifty s. it. And then. In both cases. As a substrate. We have to write fifty fifty as it. On the two position. So the two monologue last rites. And then the last step. Which is very slow. We can't leave off. The middle. Thirty s it's. And we have glass roll as well as an end product. So as i said this light paces. Prefer to be active. On oil water. Interfaces. So if we have here. The oil. Layer. And the water layer really have activity. On the surface of this oil and water. Interface. And i can also show it like this. And there we see that live paces. Like to be active. For example. In the mills you and. Very have a large sure first. Of this oil water interface or. In myself. While. If we have. Oils present as monomers. In a solution. Lie basis. Tend to degrade the substrate mites. Less. Also when we have a mono layer. We have a larger area. Of the oil. Water in the face. And this so-called super substrate so the mono layer to the mills you know or to myself is this larger area. Are specific substrates for his life basis. When we have the monomers present. We also have. Enzymes present which can be great the fifty s. it's. From this substrates. But then they are named. Esther races. So not specifically live bases. But esther raises. And then if the protective t. of esther raises first lie pays in the same story same kerf we will see that. Esther raises are very active on this kind of single thread gleiser it's presence. You see high activity here. While live places prefer to start to be active. When we have this myself. Or in milstein's presence. So a larger surface. Of oil. Water in the face. Now i have a question for you which products. Do you expect will be hydrolyzed foster. By light basis. Is that whipped cream or. Whole milk. As you get it from the employees explain why the answer is the whipped cream. Because when we hold homage a nice the cream. We reduce the federal bullets. And here by. We increase the surface area of the oil water. Interface and this we have seen. Lipids prefer death as a substrate so that leads to a high activity. Of the light basis. To summarize. Basis can be classified as an. Star hydra lays so in the enzyme class. Of hydro lasers. Most of them are position specific. They prefer to be active. On the oil water. Interface and. The difference between a lie pace. And an s. race. Is that lie bases. Preferred to be active on the middle students. Versus the estrace. Prefers to free triglycerides. Thank you for your attention.",

For example we can make use of pectinate us or said he lays us when we make juice out of through. For example i build use. Or we can make use of protease us. Or lie paces. When we make cheese out of milk or when we want to make a speed not like fructose. We can make use of lasers and clicquot emulators to convert starch first into glucose. And then use glucose as arrays to convert the glucose into fricke those. Or we can make use of emulators in serial processing. For example for the production of beer. What are enzymes. The enzymes. Three. Proteins and proteins are built from our my no s. hits and a sequence of this. S. it's real form. The protein. In a three d. structure. As is the pic that on the slides. And sense can already be present in food. Like in the epilogue. And then there are named. And the genius lee present. However we can also add enzymes in our food production process. And in that case we name. This enzymes. Xor genius. So and slums in foods can be can be directed. In the right direction. We can suppress their activity. If they lead to invest properties or. We can lead them in the right direction. And all of that is to obtain the desired properties. The enzyme classification. Is already set in one nine hundred fifty five. In that year. The commission of enzymes. At feist that. Each enzymes. Has three names one a system that the system. Name. Which is based on the search straight red enzyme is active on. And the enzyme class. Ready enzymes. Pulls in. So for example. Pectin lying there we have picton as a substrate. And the enzyme class. Is the law yes. And the last three letters of this is the method name is always a s e. The second name of an enzyme is a trivial name. So in the case of the spect in law yes that trivial name would be pectinate. Maybe other trivial. Names you have heard of or kept the lays the third. Name. The enzyme commission advised. Is an e.c. member. This is the number. Is directly derived from the enzyme class and its. Starts with the letters. E.c.. Followed by four digits. For example. E.c.. One one one one. If you would like to read more about this official classification. And nomenclature of. Enzymes. Please check. This website. So as i said. The e.c. number is directly due the rise from the enzyme class. And this is going to especially be seen in the first digit of. This number. Which refers directly to. Enzyme class one to six. What we will see. In the next slide. The second to the fourth digits. Refers to the type of reaction the enzyme catalyzes. Or dismiss physically of the reaction. So we have six enzyme classes. Which is the first digit. Of the e.c. numbering system. The first class. Are the oxy the reddick tazes. It's catalyzed oxidation reduction reactions. The second one. Are the trends phrases which remove or transfer functional groups. The third from out of hardware latest. Cleave bonce. While introducing a water molecule. We have. As for the law is this. Which can also cleave bones. Without water now this way they will introduce a double bonds. In one of the products. We have i don't raise this. It's get lies. A range of months. So for example from glucose into fructose. And some classics are delighted gazes. Which form a linkage with the use of. a.t.p. u.t.p. or c.t. be on this slide we do see so make samples in each of the. Enzyme classes. And some of them may be familiar for you. Very important to many for the patients are to hide religious. In this group for example. Full the pro to lead the. Enzymes or the protease us. But also enzymes. Active in carbohydrate structure. Like the like of side hydro lasers. And times are specific. They can be straight specific. Or reactions specific. In the case of substrate specific. An enzyme is specific for district struck a victory sticks. Of a substrate. So for example. And emulates can degrade starch. But it cannot. Hydrolyzed. A cellulose for the reaction. Specificity. The reaction is of importance. So from the same substrate. Different enzymes. Can form different products. Depending on their reactions specificity. And all this best of fizzy era. A rises from the three d. structure of the enzymes. Active site. In their protein structure. The activity of an enzyme. Is influenced by two main paramita. One is the ph. And the order one is temperature of wrong. Ph can lead to even version. In activation of the enzyme. For example. At too low ph or. On the other hand at a two. Hi ph. The protein structure. Can get damaged or. Denatured. And that leads to eat reversible. In activation of the activity of an enzyme. Also temperature is an important barrier meter. And temperature dedes into weights. Actively first when we increase the temperature. We will see that. Activity. Increases. Like in many get mikkel reaction. When we increase the temperature. That the reaction the rates will increase as well. However at too high temperature. We will get the nate's ring. Of our protein structure. So we will get in activation of our activity. So we can make use of deaths by heating up. Our product. If we would like to eliminate waste. Ends on activities. So now i have two questions for you. Can you draw. Davidic or for a certain. Enzyme. X.. Where in the first curve you plot on the x. axis the increase of temperature. First is the rate of a to fifty. And then the second. Girth. The increase of ph. First as the rate of activity. And the second question. Which enzyme acts as a hide release. Is that enzyme. A with. E.c. number two three one one. Or is that the e.c. number treat treat three one. There you can see the answer it's. So for both temperature and ph we have the same profile upon. Increase of temperature or increase of ph. The activity of the enzyme will increase. However at a too high temperature or. Too high ph. The protein structure start to denature and the activity decreases again. The top of this curve. Is what we name. The mexican temperature. Or the optimal temperature for. It's ands i'm x. or the optimal ph. The question to which the number belongs to one is be easy three treat three one. Because the first digit three. Belongs to. And i'm class three hydro lasers. For more information. You can click on the link in the p.d.f. handout. So to summarise and times. Are important in many food. Processes. Enzymes are proteins. And they're depending. Very much on the ph. And the temperature. They can be present in foods like an apple. Or we can add them. In the production process. We have discussed their main classification. In this knowledge clip. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I'm going to introduce to you several. Rights. All of those psycho rights are a psycho rights that are two to about twenty units connected to each other and an example is. Rafa knows that as one of the rights. That is present in sugar beets. I hear you have an overview as a classification of all the rights in the classification is based on the arrested use that are precedents in the legal second right. Not a first through paris to elf i collect a liquid second rights which have the us. As main type wrested use it has got locked. And examples are rafa nosek us and for further discourse. I will discuss these molecules in more detail later. For example you find. But also as i just told you in sugar beets. Not to like tell us all to go psycho rights. Are based on liked. Lactulose for example made out of flecked doctorow's. Or trans collect so seal of the ghostlike rights or gas are also based on lactose they're present naturally in human milk. Or you can make out of the lactose. In a company if you want to add. The main russian jews here is also got like to buy them all to only go psycho rides are made out of starch. So its bigger vision products off starch. Think of mel toes which is a dye cycle rides or a mile to a trials or melts with. The main components here is a glucose you want. Then the next one is effect to only go second right. And asked the name. Already tell shoe. The main component here is a fructose. Examples are crushed toes or false. And these are present in for example banana. Naturally or you can make them yourselves. Out of for example in a limb to make your own false. Components. And then the final group that i want to show you are. These are also. Glucose based molecules made out of starch. But now they are in the sickly form. So all the glucose molecular are connected to each other and then acyclic formis made. And we have alpha beta and gamma. Cycle of the extremes. I will discuss now to alpha good luck. So i can write some more detail. Here you see the molecule second rose which is a second right. And if one is added to that than. This is an alpha. Collect so only close second right. This is a rafa knows or it's a try second right. If i add another gallic to those. I got to take second right. And this is called. It has not. To get elected to office added to the glucose and fructose. If i add another one. Then the molecule. Furbished coast. Is made. And this is a pen test tech right because it has fyfe units connect to each other now these are present in. Potatoes and sugar be of pulses but also for example and. In beings tim brown beans here. Why do we call them. Alpha collect it will go separate it because when you look to the gallic toast molecule. Than a connection that is made then here. This group is pointing downwards. When you compare it to the ring structure. And that downward position is called the alpha position. That is why it's called an alpha. The like to only go second right. The holy ghost writes can have all kinds of properties in food. One property is that they can be anon by just a second right. It means that they are not the created in the digestive tract. And it also means that if the. The they end up in your gut. And if the and the pinger got than bacteria can grow on the skin on digestible legal sacrifice. And if it's to good bacteria at them we call those. I just called them pre-biotic. The downside of this is that depicting area that are growing. On the non digestible to go psycho rides can meet gases. And that can cause flights ones. Like samples of non digestible oligosaccharides are rafa knows gallstone falls. So now you know when you need to green b. are the. Brown beings. What is causing the gas production. Afterwards. That we do can also use only go psycho rights as. Ingredients in your food. Think of for example those psycho doctrines that we talked about the glucose that are connected but each other in a ring. These psycho dextrous can be added to food. To stabilize hydrophobic compounds that. Can go into a dislike like structure. And in this way we can add hydrophobic compounds to and. Hydrophilic a creation. The creationists face. A water face. And finally i want to mention this we taste. Many oligosaccharides especially when they're diced like writes. Like like to have a sweet taste. But also the little bit bigger like to the multiple to go psycho writes to try psych writes can have can be added to food. As a sweetener. I have a question to you. We've talked about alpha good luck to all of them here you see rafa knows. And here you see the name of rafa knows but it's not complete b.s. i missed the x. the y. and this. So tell me what should i put at x. y. and z.. Look at the structure to answer this question. And then second question is if. Rafa knows is degraded by an enzyme which is called alpha collective c.d.'s. Then what are the products that are formed. After this decrease. I did answer to the questions are here. Now it's called an alpha galaxy. Rights and that has a reason. As i told you to disguise. Electros molecule this group is pointing downward sort that's in the alpha position. So that's why it's an alpha. Collector still. And then it's connected to first carbon. Off the gala. To us as connected to the sixth. Carbon. Off the glucose. One two three four five six carbon of the cocoa so that is why it's a one sixth linkage. And a second question. The enzyme not the enzyme is called. Alpha collect for and it had this name has a reason. It takes off. An alpha galaxy off from the molecule. So it splits off this throws from the tri cycle rights. And then the products are there. And the left over product. So to summarise. I've talked about rights in this knowledge clip. We have different types of rights for example. The like to psych rights. Goals. False doctrines. This classification is mainly based on the mana meric units had a presence in these second rites and we've discussed. A few properties. And functions of the rights in foods.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I'm going to talk about caramel the station reactions. Caramelization is one of the browning reactions that can cause browning in food products when you heat them. Think of for example. Caramel that has his brown color a nice flavor. Which is called by that caused by the current reaction. I hear are other products. The brown color of coke drinks. Because of that. Adding caramel to the to the soda or maybe you drink this winter melon tea and singapore. That also has a little bit of a brown color because of the carabao that has been at it i should want to make caramel. Most of the time what people do is they start with a sugar so you can dry heat a sugar. Sack or o's. Or you can start with a concentrated sugar solution. Heat up that's super solution and then slowly caramel the stations. Start to take place. I hear you see an overview of the current station reactions. I see if you start with sugar. But you first need as a hydraulic reaction. After a hydraulic station. You get in a leaf station which is followed by. Dehydration or fragmentation. Oxidation this has been and at the very end you have condensation reactions. Not those. Fragmentation and oxidation. Reactions. They cause. Are almost that are very typical for caramel the station. And the final condensation reaction cost to brown pigments that are formed. That we have first need hydrolysis and why do we need to add. It's because sugar or. As a dye cycle ride and this dye cycle right as a non reducing sugar. You need reducing sugars ford the current station reaction. So we first need hydrolysis here. So we get the two components glucose and fructose. And both glucose and fructose. Are reducing sugars. Meaning they can open up the ring. If the. Ring opens up this oh age group here or this oh age group here becomes a double bond with oxygen. And that us watch we need and the next reactions after hydraulics is we have the only station. Here you see the double bomb that's oxygen. Of the glucose molecule. And now you've got a mole the station. Meaning if you have here to double bond that's oxygen. Then there's the whole bond can flip. To do the two to two between the two carbons the first of the second carbon. So you've got a double bond. Here between the first and the second carbon. Bond that is what be called one two. In the old it isn't. Out keen to that is why is it. And it's a d. old to all age groups. On the first and on the second carbon. This is in equilibrium with for. This double bond here. Can flip to the second carbon option on the second carbon. And then you get a frog to a smaller kill. Or it can be in equilibrium with man knows where the double bond goes back to the oxygen here on the first carbon. But not a zero age group that's flipped to the other site. So you get a man. So in a male the station. For those clue cause a man knows are in equilibrium with each other via add a one to deal. And this one to. Do you all can react furder as it will show you in the next light. Now it's important to know what does this mean elise ation is pretty slow at. Acidic. P. h. which most of our food is the city. So it's very often it's a slow reaction. Not a one to aim deal. Will react further. And you see that here. This is a dehydration reaction. Three times a water molecule comes off. Here one two three times of what a molecule. Not to three important. Products that we have here so we saw. What a want to india ole water molecule comes off. Meaning that there is no all its crop here anymore. And if that reacts furder. Than what we call alpha d. carbon you'll come baden's formed. Here is she to decarbonise. To double bond as oxygen. Next to each other this is a reactive. Molecule. And it will definitely. React fodor again the water molecule comes off. So now this. Carbon has no age group anymore. And not a wall of water molecules coming off. And if then the ring closes again a molecule is formed that this cold. Hydroxy. Mithal for for all and. H m f is used as an indicator molecule. For for example. A fruit juice that has been heated. Because when you heat a fruit juice then the sugars. In the food you start to react. In illustration takes place. The dehydration can take place. And that is how. H m f is formed. Now here you see that. So on the y. axis. You see that is produced in time when you heat a fruit juice at different temperatures. And you can clearly see that the higher to temperature. The more h m f will be formed in time. In the fruit juice. And fruit. It a fruit industry for example use assist to see whether the fruit juice has been passed to rice. Yes or not. No other reactions that can take place on the one to deal is for example disassociation reaction. All rearrangement reactions. So again you have the. The carbon will compound here and that the carbon will compound can cause. This wish a sion. So the first here this first carbon this coming off. And a small molecule is formed and al the height. Or you can gather. Kind of a rearrangement. Which can. Again react furder. Other reactions to can talk start to. Take place. Are oxidation reaction so. The one to india will react nollywood an oxygen molecule. And as a group is formed. And another small acid group is formed. Which can. For example be a specific taste component. Also fragmentation reactions can take place on the in deal. Than the molecule. Breaks up into different molecules and aldehyde here. And another component there. Which can again be in the roma compound. Not all these reactions. That we just looked at we call them the primary reactions. So anal the sation oxidation fragmentation. This wish ation. And the products that are. The heights and assets. These are the first reaction products of the might of reaction. These can react furder. And what we call the secondary reactions which are to only sation reactions. And now. All kind of compounds were forms. There are many secondary. Oxidation products of the elderly station. And also a little bit of color can be formed. Only not the brown color is but more to yellow. Yellowish colors are formed. Not after elderly station reactions then we can get the final condensation reactions. Meaning that. All the products that has been formed. So far. Can react photo read each other and with other components that are present in your food. And then. What we call our large. Unsaturated polymers can be formed. And these large and saturated. Polymers. Those are the brown pick. Once they have a complex variable structure. And the colored that is formed depends on the p. h. or other components that are present in the food. But here you see different kyra miles that you can buy it from a carmel producing company and. Very often the give number stood at carmel that you. Can for example put on the the. The label of your package of the food product saying. I have added. This. Caramel to my food product. For example. Now we've seen a few different reactions that take place during caramel the station. And let's see if you now can figure out for fructose. This is a ketosis. What kind of in the ules can be formed out of freak toaster actually two different kind of deals that can be formed. Can you draw destructors for me. Because it's a double bond as oxygen is on the second carbon. Than. The there. They can be formed. To do different types of deal. The in deal can be. Between the first and the second carbon or between the second. And the third carbon. So do you start at two products. Here to india will is. To all age groups on the first and a second carbon. And here you have two all its groups. To it on the second. And the third carbon. So to summarize this knowledge clip. I've talked about caramel the solution. We have hydrolysis reactions first then. It's followed up by a milli station and. After in the early station we can have dehydration. Fragmentation. Oxidation this way. And later on followed by. L. the recession. And all kind of all roma compounds are now forms. And later on if all these components react with each other then finally we can get compensation and put ameri station reactions. Which gives the brown color of carmel.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I'm going to talk about my your reactions my your reactions are. One of the two. Browning reactions that can cause browning in food when you heat to food. A good example is for example here just typical dutch cookie. It's called a slow baffle. And it has this nice brown color on the outside because when you bake to quickly. You get the brown for mission. And that is my ya reaction to same reaction takes place when you for example toast your brett. Your bread turns brown. And also a lot of flavors are formed and these are both caused by the my own reactions. I hear you've seen example of the brat that is big to me often at two different temperatures. You see the browning and x. on the y. axis. And it's followed in time. While the bad as. Baked. A two hundred degrees and a two hundred fifty degree celsius. And then you clearly see that the higher temperature. The more brown color. Pic means are formed. Now what is this my your reaction here you see a picture of. Mr my yard. Who came up with this reaction. It's a complex reaction. And it's defined it up in three faces. You first have to initial face. And it starts with a reducing sugar that reacts with an amino group. Not that is followed by are what we call dama dorian the heintz rearrangements. And then you get the intermediate face. Where many of the flavor compounds are formed. The reactions here are one two in illustration. Disassociation struck critiquer they shouldn. These reactions are followed up by the final reactions in the final phase. And you have condensation reactions. And to what we call may know it in some ala know it and sort of brown pigments that. Make your brad. Brown or your meat. Brown when you bake it. Now instead of just putting it only in words i also made a scheme for you. And here you see the initial phase to in to me to your face. And. Final phase in the initial phase to two reactions. First to reducing sugar and amino group. React what it should are and to a quite a scale in mind. That's like a spill in a mine. Reaction furder. I'm a dorian heinz for your arrangements. But i will discuss these two reactions in more detail. After that. I'm a dory and a heinz product. Reacts furder for example in in the only station reaction. And these in utilization reactions. Are followed by for example struck of the corrugation reactions. And even more reactions follow on this. And all the reaction products here can react with each other and form what we call. The mainland know what incentive final face. Sort of brown pigment. So the reaction to a b. c. etc i will discuss them now in more detail. Let's start with aid. So aid to reducing sugar reacts with an immune approved. Now you see that here. Here you have the glucose molecule. But then. The ring is now in the open form. So that is why it's called a reducing sugar. The ring can open up. And when a ring is open. You get this double bond that's oxygen. That vista. The carbonell group. This carbon mill group. Will react with an amino group. In this example i show you an amino acid. How do you know acid here. Has the amino group. And these two react but each other. And what you've got is that. This double bond that. Oxygen now. Here. Becomes the o.-h.. And the nitrogen. Of the amino group. The nitrogen. Here is now bonded to the glucose molecule. If water molecule now comes off. So actually this croup is coming off than the single bond that nitrogen turns into a double bond with nitrogen. And this is what we call an ultra seal in mine. At this a mine. Will react furter. Also during can close again. So you've got. Alfalfa still or a beta al the seal. But when the ring is in the open form. Then this double bone that nitrogen here. That is what we're looking to look at in the next reaction to all the steel in mine. And that is when we get to i'm a dory and a heinz rearrangements. Now let's start with the. I'm a dory rearrangements so if we started with the glucose. Which wasn't. Algos. So it has to double bond that's optional. On the first carbon. Than. It reacted with in the mino group. And it attached. Where did the oxygen was on the first carbon. So here we have not a double bond with nitrogen and. In the rearrangement. Changes take place. That looks very carefully. You see here to double bonded nitrogen turning into a single bond with nitrogen. While this single bond this option. Turns into a double bond option. This is a rearrangement of the alma dorie rearrangement. I just seem can take place. When you not start wooden elbows but with the key toes. So for example if you start with the fructose. Fructose has the double bonded option. On the second carbon. When the ring is in the open. And when the ring. Opens up. And then when the double bond auction has reacted to it or an amino group. Than the whole bunch of nitrogen. Is formed. So does a stick. Kids a seal. A mine. Now with this case a seal in mine. Also a rearrangement can take place and this case we call that the heinz rearrangements. And the heinz rearrangement. The same thing happens us in a majority rearrangement. You have to double bonded nitrogen here. Turning into a single bone that nitrogen. And the single bond is oxygen. Turning into the abundance of caution. That is the heinz product. Both the heinz products. And the amador product. Can react. Further i will show you the. I'm a dory products how it can react furder. And now we are in the into me to your face. And in this case. I'm going to talk about. One two and two three in all the station that can take place on the. I'm a dory product. So you see it see i'm a dory product because it has a double bonus option on the second carbon. And the single bonded not you don't on the first carbon. And this reacts further. The first you have to in a lease ation. We talk about anal. Then you have an l. keene. So a double bond between the carbons. With an all. On their solenoid group on there. That's what you see here. A double bond between the two carbons. With an o. age group attached to it so this is an anal. But the anal is formed out of the oem adored product. And then it reacts further. What happens in this case you see that here this. Group the amino group here. Or this here. That comes off. And when it comes off than. It reacts also but it would have water molecule here. A double bond as oxygen is formed. But you also see here in this reaction is that. This or age group pair. Is taken off. So this or each group. Taken off. Meaning that here. The third carbon has no each group anymore. And that is why we call this a three day ox he's on. This is an example of one to in all the sation. We can also have two three. In a lease ation. So instead of making double bond between the first and a second carbon. Now in this case we make the double bond between the second. And the third carbon. That is five we called. Two three. In all the station. Again also here. I mean a group is taken off so here doesn't mean a group. It's taken off. And when you look at. Reaction product. You see that the first carbon doesn't have an all. Anymore no age group anymore. And that is why we call this a. One day oxy zone. And what you also see. In both cases. Is that this group has formed. This group here. With two carbons next to each other with. Both of them a double bonus option. This is what we call a d. carbon meal. So the carbon also forms and. These d. carbon is of very reactive. So it will definitely react further into my yard reactions. And that is what i will show you next. So here you have the di carbonell. Which can come from several reactions. And with that reaction with this compound tracker dick radiation can start to take place. Strike or degradation. Means first to de carbon you'll need to react with a new. Amino group. So i take a new amino acid which and then you know group. It reacts. Again with the double bonds option here. Just on the ask the very first reaction that i talked about not just to react but each other. Water molecule comes off. And the two components are not connect with each other and now the degree addition starts. Takes place. What happens is that by adding a water molecule. You split the molecule here. And then it is also split again here. And what you get. Is this tracker aldehyde. And a carbon dioxide. Now these trekker l. the heights are very over matic. Or are a magical compounds. One of the aromatic compounds sort of formed in the my r. reaction. That these amino ketones. Can also react for and that is what i show you here. It's a one of the follow up reactions of the stock structure degrees. Secret ation. So two of these amino keith. Tones. React but each other and they form a ring. As you can see and. All kind of different drinks come form. The are groups of course of them you know as this can be all kind of. Groups. So you can get all kind of different. Person there with feats. Which are also our of matzoh compounds that are formed in my own reaction. Not now we have formed. All kind of compounds in the into meatier face. And all these compounds like for for all their fates are ruddock's own sun degradation products aldehyde amino ketones etc. All these products. Gifts nice smells. But if they react. Further we'd each other and what we call condensation employer marry station reaction. Then we get to brown pigments. And these pictures are also called mila no wouldn't say it's very difficult to see. This is a melon know it and it's a complex structure. It's often a large structure. And it gets a brown color. But it can have all kind of different structures. So again if you look at the scheme. We've talked about reaction. And be so it starts that is important. My your reaction always starts with a reducing sugar. Reacting with it i mean you know a group. And then. All kind of follow up reaction take please. Make sure you know about it mcgorry and the heinz rearrangements. That you know about to structure degree patient and about. In all the station. That you understand that afterwards all kind of condensation reaction takes place. And that in into meatier face all kind of aroma compounds are formed. And then the final face the brown pigments the middle know what in store for it. None of my or reaction is influenced by all kind of conditions. Of course. First you need. Amino groups bresson's. So for example a protein. Of an amino acid. Need to be present. Also you need reducing sugars. Than the temperature. The ph water activity. All influences to read of the. Reaction. Also oxygen content can have an influence or dose sulfide content can inhibit. To my yard action. Also how do you heat your product. Is it a microwave or an oven or are you baking in oil or frying it all influences what kind of reactions in a my your reactions. Are taking place. And also storage conditions. Do you store a your product at a lower temperature or a higher per temperature. Can speed up or decrease to speed up to my gut reaction. I've learned a lot about my reactions of you've seen several. Reaction and components. In this knowledge clip. Now. Let's see if you recognize these components and if you can fill that in. And these two reactions so you have a component. Eight. Reacting with an amino group. Then the component be a mine is formed and. That is followed up by component c. nama dorie product. And what if it is component d.. Then a key to a seal is in. Formed and a hind product. What is a b. c. d. e. and f.. Take your time to answer this question. So here you see the answers. So if you see here. All those feel a mine. Then you know dad. It comes from an elder height. Meaning that is comes from a component that has the double bond as oxygen in the first carbon. So that is the case here. Of glucose this is the glucose molecule so this should be a. Glucose reacts with an amino group. And then an elder a mine is formed. Or in other words. This double bonus option has changed into a double bonded nitrogen compound. Which you see here. So that should be b.. That is the a mine. And then the mcgorry rearrangement. Takes place. Meaning that the double bone that nitrogen turns into. Single bomb with nitrogen and a single bomb that's oxygen into a double bond as oxygen. And we find out here. Single bone that nitrogen on the first double bonus oxygen on the second carbon so that is the first reaction and then the second three action. We have to start with. Ketosis because a case of seal. A mine is formed. Now the ketones here is the option on the second carbons for that must be d.. And then. When it reacts within the mino group. This double bond the oxygen should turn into a double bonded nitrogen. And we find that here. So that is easy. And then with the rearrangement of the hinds rearrangement to double bonded nitrogen turns into a single bomb the nitrogen. You find out here. So to summarize. And this might this knowledge kept. I've talked about a my your reaction. The my our reaction always starts with an amino group. That reacts first. With reducing sugar. And then it's followed up by all kind of other reactions. Like the i'm a dorian heinz rearrangements. All kind of in all the station reactions. Structure d. grid ation and. The products of these reactions is all kind of a roma sort of formed. And the brown pigments the melon know it in subtle forms of the condensation reactions.",

                "text": "I'm here with dr huling by. She said. Principal researcher at a level three of plant breeding and backing of the university and she works on. Interests of breeding into moto healing. Can you explain to us what is interesting reading sure. Here i view is your my flight. And here. Into aggressive breeding we call it. What is the basic off into aggressive breeding. And you see that cult you are with the green collar you see the well it. Sorts of species. There in the intro aggressive breeding. You do across and your back across to the coward who are. After many generation you'll end up with a coward who are. With a small piece of red d.n.a. from these a dollar. Into the cartel. And this we call it. Into aggressive. Breeding and the bases are for that is the cross on the back of course. And of course. To reduce the. Introgression. You need to crossing over. Now what is a crossing over. I briefly will mention it. But before i show you another picture. There you see the red. Tomato. The green tomato. This is a way out. This is what we eat. The college you are. And the. And the products of that into aggressive braiding is the red everywhere. With a small piece of. Green d.n.a. from these a well to sort it all made it all into the. Cultivated a tornado. This. Lion. Have four. Chromosome introgression. On chromosome one let's say it. And here you have another one. And this one. You have on chromosome twelve. And here you see. This is the central me here. With the blog. Is the hydro chrome eighteen. And here the red other your chrome eighteen that's just that the chromosome structure. I hope this is a clearance. Yes you said it's because of the. Sure you show us what you want. Thank you yes indeed. There's a crossing over is the basic. Of the intro aggressive. Braiding. And they here you see the pairing you are in the mouth all safe. And you see the black. Is from one parent orion. And the other one is the white wire is a from another cow to our parent old man. The are in the mouth also use. The chromosome we'll pair. Then during the pairing. There could happen. It's the crossing over. And here i show you. Usually a and a b.. Big a and big b. are together. If there is a crossing over. Now you see big a. They are linked with small a b.. Now you see the a little component here we call it. This other. Recombinant. This to become by a nation. Pushes the introgression smaller. The fragment. Smaller and smaller. And i hope now it's clear. It's free and. So for combining the green rooms or materials to do more and. Read drums all of the. Good for you need recommendation. And you need professionals. That's for sure doesn't always occur or other situations where this crossing over is hamburg. But it's all kerning. Most of the time. But they are raw several times. Crossing over is hampered you sure you want example. But this time. Is tomato and potato. Now you see tomato. That's this a criminal. And a potato here. Chromosome six. Sure tom. That means our ball for the centromere. Now you see this the color yellow green blue. That's the color of the piece of the d.n.a. in tom a toy in such a physical alder. And the in potato we could see you there all there is a university. You see blue green and yellow. There is that. In washer. In this case a beaten. Potato and the toll may toll and. If you see in the microscope for the or in the mouth all sees the pairing is a hand part than you have in washington loper there. And the in this case. There is no crossing over. We've seen this lope to the next a slice. If there is in russia and you see that red green and the green red. Either they do not pear. Because there is no harm all already beaten them. All the pair in the wrong way. All they are certain lope. And they all for these this three cases they do not leave for good again mate. So you do not have a good get made for the crossing over event. Therefore all of them are cursed. In this region. We will be hafe like one bloke. These. We call it. The hump or of crossing the hump of the into aggressive brady. Yes i believe. The reason you published on such a problem. Tomorrow. When you want to introduce usage. That's true. That's a. Yes sure. And that's the story i want to start with the linkage of drag because we saw there's a link if you drag. In the cultivation. Then the problem is there but what is the cause. That was the starting point of our research. And this is again the in washington you see the different the car learn there you see the right it all there are in the breeding. If you have your gene. In the in russian. Now you see that piece of the d.n.a. of for the whole you know russia. Will be introgression. Into the college who are there we call it a linkage a drag because i don't want it. Also introgression. Into this. College you are now with this i would like to give you a good example. Shall i start with the example. Yes. Ok then the example it's about the t y r c very resistance. And you see this is the virus. Very small only. Circle of the d.n.a. with the six genes there. But the helper. Is the way it fly. What is the transmitting this virus. The same proton. Is this yellow and the curved indeed if therefore it's caught. Told medo yellow leave. Corroding. Virus in the cultivated told wait whoa. There you see this in the wild species. There is a gene t. while one ot he was three. And with this gene that you get a healthy plant. Of course a breeder would like to have these into the college you are however. There was a mystery. Because this isn't where it is a locket it. Is are known before. Our research. What it has are known that's because people first published. It's linked to this marker. And later on they use a marker in this a blog. They say is to hear this all the markers are together. But physically. The are part. These are the physical distance in meeting pairs that you see the physical distance. Of them are cursed. But the d.n.a. at a cli they are together. Show you this other series circled markers. In the previous allies in the previous lies. You see this. And physically they are part but now. The and then take orally. I was sure you follow me with this picture. These are the recombinant. Identified from more than ten thousand that have to. Now you feel located to the plant. Recombinant. These are the general types. You probably. We were not looking into the detail but have your lead you through the collar. The red the collar is the height or their goals like i've won. The a. Goring collar is like the coward he waited to told me told. The be. Is a homo there goes like the doner. Of the wild sorts. If you see a calmer chair which means there is a little change. That's the crossing over. Like way previously said that big a to a small a b.. And the in this case you see a lot off a chance. In this area. But nothing happened here. These are the survey markers. You physically they are very our part. But then that equally. They are all as one blog. So as one person on the chromosome. On the d.n.a. take a map. And this is our problem. And then you found out. You choose. Gruesome rearrangement. How do you investigate this. Yes the way. Indeed find out what is the cause of this chromosome. Crossing over a suppression. It was. It was not that easy i would say. Because it can be many reason but we have the indication between the tomato and the potato. Could be there or so in russian. Therefore we need a technology to do that how to visualise it. Then we use the fish attack knowledge. Of course. I would love to do this officially but it's not like this. I believe you assume what is a fish fish in the term. Is fluorescent in central hybridise ation. And this is the. Powerful tool. To date tect. Chromosome rearrangement. And here i show you what is that. Technique. Indeed. This is the plant. We as solid as the d.n.a. the d.n.a.. You can put them into pieces you use them and them for that yes true. You can also use the force. To cut the. Dung. And this piece of d.n.a.. You can only eighteen to eek or lie. Sometimes we call it. By. Bacteria artificial chromosome. And you can make the label. In another worst two car right. After labeling your planted into chromosome. The d.n.a.. These are the whole piece of. Chromosome. Now you can see the physical location of each box. It means each piece of d.n.a.. Hair. That's a technique. We use to issue that. Then have you issue in there are three added to a what happened in the reading. I'm working on. This is the picture again. There you see this story. Marked. Area. That's the only wants to investigate. Then again ethically they are together. Physically they are part. With take these these these pieces off the d.n.a. to make a bad for library. With the length of these a box. We print into chromosome. Now you see. This is that a prolonged like. Cultivated. Told me it will remember that all there are red or green. And these are the all there are. This is the introgression. With that see less. Well species. There you see the green. This is a central me or this line. This is agreeing to the long arm. From a short time to long arm. Now you feel look. Care for this two collar poor poorer than they are even worth it here. The yellow. Is collinear. Is a fun way she'll actually. There is a present location. From this area to here. There is in russian. In this area. So this is the interpretation of the true picture of the same issue. You see the red color lead near yellow. Collinear. But in between. There are certain location there as the inversion. This is a region where exactly is this area. Showing india and then take away. There is no. Crossing over ahead. Bent. Because of chromosome. Rearrangement. The fish. Is a very powerful. Yes and no you know. There's a chromosome rearrangements. And how do you advise you know. Readers to. What is the consequence for readers of these mortgage. The consequence is very big. Of you explain it in two way. Forced. I would say. If my tea while winding. This is dean is located here. In this region. I says should the fall. What will happen. So that one could be in this area. That's the area. There is no crossing over. You for the arsenal crossing all were tell what happened in the breeding the breeders. Use a marker here. To see elected t y a y n they tried to in for grabs the tea while one. Into the college who are actually the dean was located. Fabi lot of these the blog. Look our. Result is below the blog. And then they head off after many years. Intro grassed to offer the chromosome from a to lens to cultivated to told me it all in that case. To sort of offer that she lands a chromosome. Cause a lot tougher linkage a drag. So that's a lot of the genes. In this region from well out into college of it. There's a link to drag. So the question to rinse. The answer to rinse question. If my demon. Is located through here. In this in russian. I would tell the breather forget this de search for another one. Yeah. But the lucky lady. We are sure in that she while one. Actually is below the blog. Is a hair. And it's in the same radiance similar reading i said she was three. And later on we sure that he was a one to us three not true but two are loose. Of the same doing. Imagine that one. On the shore tom. Key west three on the long arm. As a breather. Natural way is i try to combine it. Into one breeding line. That has been dong by man the breeders of for many years but not always a new information to you while want us to be both us at the same allow kurdish different a little combine it into one brady is impossible. So you have to create it to another way to use this to a loose all for the same dealing. Than i would say. Introgression them into different. Parent or line. Than combine them into one. Hybrid of one. That could happen. So that's a two impact it depends where there is a locket it just is unique. Or does it look more. Goofy. Groups of girls. Grooms and rearrange that suppress. Thing. Yeah. I would say it's not uniquely and tomato. Than i would show you the. This is another slice to shoot you i want us to be a little ache. But now i wish you the. It has a coal mine. That here is us allies to see the tomato potato they are see in washington now you'll see that many chromosomes. This is the publication you feel like you can't go. But i would sure your mall here you see chromosome short tom. If you look at here that's a potato. And then here you see a tornado there you see the in russian happening. This empanel a pretty coy there as well species. If you go to last. There is another young worsham chromosome seven as. You see manly. Situation. Like chromosome six. Is a happening in the wild. Tomato species. They've used to come to be found in this publication. Now what is the consequence. To a breather. Are you going to a researcher. Then chromos. Rearrangement are very common in plant species. And this can cause. Linkage adric. If you are not all way all fired as a breeder you are blunt. You believe that awful. Many years. In that introgression braiding. The fragment will become smaller. But if there is a in russian. If there are so chromosome rearrangement. Nothing will happen. The whole piece will believe. We will behave like one. Lol cursed. To be interest. And as a breather. You can use the fish. As a tool. To shew you. The problem. But it can not help you to solve the problem. You have to fund. Depending on the situation. Your own solution. And that another one is no days. Ever things can be sequenced and. We have tornado as a reference journal. If you are sequencing the. The wild sorts told me till now you use that reference gentleman to assembly. Your own wild sort. Gentle. If you are not aware of the chromosome rearrangements. You are getting are wrong. Family. So these are the consequences not only in brady. But also in research. Thank you very much for explaining us. The impact of. Groom some rearrangements. Breed. You're welcome rinse but before i close i would like to send people who are you involved in the work. It was done in probably brady martin was the ph d. doing the research research was the promoter. And i would like specialties that the laboratory offered and that takes calls the rule is that the person. Expert all of the fish and doris and say now was the ph d. working on the project. The done their hair. Thank you also.",

                "text": "And this knowledge clip. I'm going to talk about anti-magic browning there to know about the browning reactions of food. We called i'm currently sation reactions on my ya reactions. I say non. anti-magic browning. Because you can also have and traumatic browning in food. Think off. Your apple that turns brown when you eat it. Take a bite in it and on an hour you look at it and it turns a little bit brown. That is an enzymatic browning. At a non-answer about a browning most of you will notice anti-magic no mention about it browning for from for example the caramel candies. That have this brown color. And also this. Typical carmel flavor. Here are more food products that. All of these brown colors. Come from. I don't know my your reaction or the caramel the station reaction. Like chocolate brown beer. A brown. Brat. Pizza. Cookies. All these brown callers and also the flavors. That are formed during the production of food products. Are all caused by my your reaction. Or caramel the station reactions. So there are two types of nun and somatic browning reactions. And they are both. Taking place. Mainly under influence of heat. So for carabelli sation if you take a reducing sugar. And you heat that sugar. Than all kind of reactions start to take place. Another very and. Brown pick them and some are formed and. Aroma components. For my reaction is almost the same. You also start with reducing sugars. But now it's not the reducing sugars that react but each other but you need this and as a second. Substrate. And that is an amino group. I mean a groups are present in. For example amino acids or in proteins in food. And if the two react with each other and are also all kind of followup reactions. Then again. Brown pick means are formed and. A role model components. I hear you have a scheme of the current station reaction. I'm not going to discuss each reaction in detail. But i will show you the general overview. If you take sugar. And you had sugar. Then you might no doubt it will at the end it will caramelize and give this nice dessert off. Completely for sugar sugar molecules are not reducing sugars. So the first thing that you will need and this reaction. For sugar is hydrolysis. Off the sugar into glucose and fructose. And then all kind of follow up reactions to take place. It only sation. Dehydration fragmentation. Oxidation reactions and. The this. These reactions. A lot of the flavor components are formed. And then later on in the process she will get condensation and polarization reactions. And here at the end. During these polymers to station reaction brown pick moons are formed. And here you see the colors. Starting with some. Pale yellowish color. Turning more rat. And finally really brown. Caramel color. Now for my our reaction i show you a different screen. Scheme and although it looks really different. Actually the same kind of reaction as in caramel the station is taking place in the my yard reaction. Maybe you recognize here you do work in only station. Fragmentation. But not are also new ones like tech or digger they show. I'm a dorian hines rearrangements. But the most important difference is the starting point. A starting point for my your reaction. Is a reducing sugar. Reacting with an amino group that is to initial face. And intermedia face mostly to flavor components are formed and. Add the final phase of the my reaction. What we call. Mulla know it ins are formed. And these muslim know what and. These are the brown pigments that give the brown color. To for example meat. That we've seeing. The difference between a caramel we say. And then my ya reaction. And here you have a few food products that have a typical brown color and also flavor because of. I don't use two reactions. I want you to have a look at these two pp these products and. Think of yourself. Is this caused by in my yard reaction. Or a caramel the station reaction. Now the answers are. For a cola. Cola has a brown color and it is a caramel color. First. Sugar. Solution is heated until a caramel is formed. And then this car a mile is added to the cola drink. To give it a brown color. For meat. You know all that meat has quite a lot of protein. So when you heat the meat. And you bake to me down at a certain point it starts to brown and this is definitely because of my yard reactions. Because of the proteins that are present in me. And the same is true for coffee. When you heat agreeing. Fresh coffee beings. When you dried a coffee beans first and then you. Roast those green coffee beans. Then they become. Brown. And also a lot of flavors released by this brown color is caused by my yard reaction. And also because there are proteins preston's in the coffee beans. If you think of choice sauce. Also so i saw us as a brown color and this wrong color is mainly. Caused by my guy reactions that take place during the production of to source sauce. Also because again. Proteins are present in the soil. And then to fried onions that's a little bit of a difficult one. Most people will think of fried onions as being. Caramelized onions and. That is pretty true. There. Caramelization is definitely taking place in the onions but also that there are a little bit of proteins present and the onions so order will definitely also be. My reactions taking place during the browning. Of fried onions. So to summarize. We've talked about none. And somehow that browning. At is to heed saying. In all the food product that leads to a broadening. And you can have either. Caramelization or my your reaction. Sation than the substrate is a reducing sugar. And we talk about my own reaction than you have to stop the substrates. You need a reducing sugar. And in the mean a group for example from proteins. Both. Reaction result and wrong colors and. All kind of pick. Color and pigments. And flavors and. Aroma components.",

                "text": "And this knowledge that. I'm going to talk about the properties of mono and diesel. Di cicco rights. And i'm mainly talking about the properties they have in food. Thing for example sugar that of course is sweet. That is one property. Of sugar. But these are the properties that i want to talk about. With you at the high school ability of sugars. There chris of a station that can take place when there was an over separation of sugars. I want to talk about the lowering of the water activity that sugars can perform. And at the end i want to talk about the sweetness of sugars. Sugars have a very high sole ability for example. Normal table sugar has a small ability of. Two hundred grams per one hundred grams of water at room temperature. And that is also the definition of solvability sole ability is how much sugar a certain amount of sugar. Can be dissolved and. How much water. Which sorts in volume of water. At which temperature at a certain temperature. And here you see the effect of temperature. On the sole ability of several sugars. You see that. If the temperature increases. Also disability of sugar increases. But if you have it over such a ration of sugars. Meaning the others more sugar. In the food product then can be dissolved into food product. Then this over saturated sugar. Starts to crystallize and you see that clearly here in the picture. That here. You see sugar crystals because there is too high concentration of sugar and. The oversaturated sugar bowl crystallized in the food product. I dislike and properties of sugars. Is that they can lower what's her activity. And you clearly see that in this picture here on the x. axis you have the concentration of sugar. And on the y. axis you have to water activity cool fissioned and you can see that if we increase the sugar concentration. The water activity off that's. So lucian. Is going down. Now what is the importance of that. What is watter activity. Actually i tried to explain that with this picture. Here you see a carbohydrate. And this case i show you three units. And you see the water molecules. These water molecules are bound to the water. To the carbohydrate. If i add more water molecules. As you see here. Than these extra water molecules will not be bind. Anymore. To the carbohydrates. These sort of molecules. Now a picture done green are free. Water molecules. What her activity describes that ratio between free water molecules and bond. Water molecules. The more free water molecules you have the higher the water activity. So the more active this water can be. Or other way around. The more water molecules are bound to to carbohydrate. The lord the water activity. Of that food product will be. What is the effect of water activity done in a food product. And you can see that in this figure. You see that. Here the water activity on the x. axis. And here is the rather tough speed of these reactions. Compared to each other if the water activity is one. Meaning. All the water is free. The most of these reactions are very fast. And also the growth of many bacteria is really high. If we lower the water activity. By adding. For example sugar. So the sugar buying still water. There is less free water available for bacteria to grow. Or four times to have an activity. And for the sorts of reactions. So in other words. The water activity has a large influence on the gun mccoll reactions or the bacteria. Growth in a food product. Not the last property i want to talk about is the sweetness of. Here you have a few sugars and. The relative sweetness knight has called the relative sweet this because sweetness was always placed relative to wart normal sugar. So enormous your goal is sacrosanct. And has sat. To one. And all the other. Sugar so sugar substitute the sweetness is compared to the sweetness of. Normal table sugar. And then you can see that for example glucose. Has a lower sweetness. I hear you have sugar substitutes like sorbet tolling to be told that you might know from. Chewing gum and. They have maybe a lower or even. Its best sweet as normal sugar. But the good thing about these. Substitutes is that they have less energy. And then your minority sweeteners. Like aspartame. Or maybe you've heard about stevia. These molecules are very sweet. Think of aspartame having its weakness of. One hundred to two hundred times sweeter than normal sugar. Meaning that you need. Only a very small amount to replace the sweetness of the sugar. For example in a diet coke. The sugar is replaced by the aspartame. And the essence of k. very often combined. And you need only a very small amount of that to replace the sweetness of. The sugar. That is normally present. Now also to quality of the sweetness can. Is different. Especially for the sweeteners. They very often have a after taste. Sweetness is also depending on the temperature of the food product the p. h. of the food product. And the other substances that might be present in a food product. An example here is the temperature. And especially for up to those is very dependent on the sweetness of those. It's very dependent on the temperature. And this is because of the mental rotation that takes place. When the temperature changes. Also a different structure. There's that for to us can have also changes. Up in this knowledge clip you've learned about several properties. And what properties what's this weakness and we are going to do now a calculation with this weakness. So imagine you have a sugar solution a second row solution of one mole or. One will probably turn and. We are hydrolyzed saying this. Sugar and fifty percent of the sugar is. Hydrolyzed. Into. Glucose and fructose of course. And i want you to calculate the relative sweetness of the solution. After hydrolysis. Now here you have your answer. So before hydrolysis i have a pure sugar solution meaning that the relative sweetness of this solution is one. After hydrolysis how of their sugar molecules have been hydrolyzed. Into glucose and fructose. Meaning now after hydrolysis to concentration is now. Health. A mole. And also the glucose and fructose concentration is each health. And will probably turn. Not a relative sweetness of these sugars. Is different. So i have how from will of one relative sweetness still left over. So that is what we have here in a calculation help them all off the relative sweetness of one. Healthful mole. Of a relative sweetness of zero point six five. And healthful mole. Of a relative sweetness of one point four. And if you add these numbers up. It gets a relative suit weakness of one point five. Meaning that inferred sugar is sweeter than normal sugar. So to summarize. And this knowledge clip. I've talked about suffer all properties of motorcycle rights and dissect rights. Talked about the sole ability that the sole abilities very high and that the pounds on the temperature and when it. Concentration is very high and it's oversaturation one chrysalis station takes place. Of talk about sugar binding and that this lowest of walter activity and how important water activity is for reactions in food. And i've talked about sweetness. That the sweetness is different for different sugars or different sweeteners. And that this. Sweetness is also. Temperature dependent.",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I'm going to talk about the. Hydrolysis. That can take place within carbohydrates. A good example of hydrolysis in the food industry. Is to use all of the after eight chocolates. Maybe you noticed liquid. Sugary and side. In those chocolates. Now how did they make this house of possible to have this liquid inside. Covered with chocolate. They didn't cover to chocolate over the liquid. What they did this first make a kind of solid sugar mass. And that was covered with chocolate. And then over time and time. That was also added and sugar mass. Hydrolyzed. That sugar into glucose and fructose and put those in for close together. It's what we call infer chukker. And infer chukker it's like wit. That has to resign now. And there's not a clip i'm going to talk about hydrolysis. And here you see to dissect right sugar or second rows and it has two glucose units here on this side. And a fork to a shoot out here on that side. And hydrolysis. These two units. Are cleaved. From each other. Now if you look at to get nickel for your reaction. You see here the second row small akil and then a water molecule was added. And that is why because of hydrolysis. And then a glucose and fructose unit is formed. Now this cleavage can be done in two ways it can be done by an enzyme and in the case of a second roast the un time is called in for tastes or. This breakdown can also be done gamma clee and. Often this take. Takes place when you heat up the sugar. And especially when there is a little bit of acid press and than the hydrolysis is taking place pretty easily. Not a good example as i already told you as to the production of and virtues are here you see a picture of him for two or inferred sugar is. Almost a liquid like. And it's a glucose and fructose together that makes it that it's a kind of flick quick. But important to know. When we talk about hydraulic station. Is that after hydrolysis. More reducing groups are forked here before hydrolysis. There are no reducing groups or age group here that was here. And though each group. That was here. Is connected by if i had a bond here. So there is no reducing and. But the products. Glucose and fructose both. Do have for reducing group. Here's to reducing repair and. Here is another reducing group. And that makes that. Before hydrolysis. Through our no reducing sugar. After hydrolysis. There are two reducing groups. Now. That was the case of sugar. But now i'm going to look at a longer molecule for example this. Almost polysaccharide. It's. Let's imagine it's only glucose collective but each other not. Every connection means that there is no reducing group. Only at the end. There was one reducing and. So if we measured this molecule. Than we've measured one reducing and. Over of the eighteen groups. That we have here. If we now hydrolyzed this molecule. Let's see. We split into two we have one time. A hydrolysis. Now. We have two reducing groups. Over all the other groups. And if we keep on doing this we keep on hydrolyzed saying more and more reducing answer forms. Average hydrolysis. Releases one extra. Reducing and. We can keep on doing this until every. Linkage between the two glucose units just split. And then we have a lot of her juicing and. Now. To follow this hydrolysis. A case of starch. What is often done is measuring the d. or. That the ied that stands for dextrose. Equivalent. Now what is dextrose dextrose is another word for glucose. So the dextrose equivalent. Comes from the idea that starch is a poly mare of glucose and. The more glucose are released the more. Dextrose are released. So how equivalent. Is it. To dextrose the deck crippled and or to d.. Has this formula. It is hundred times. And then you take the number of reducing ns. And you divide that by the total number of two coast units that are present. So. Also do a link to glucose units all of them together. So let's imagine we have a starch molecule. It's a very big starch molecule that's draws far smaller cule really large and it's made of maybe thirty thousand. Glucose units connected to each other thirty thousand. Now this one starch molecule has one. Reducing and. Only here. So when i would put these numbers and the formula i would get one. Here. And then divide by thirty thousand. Now you can imagine. If you divide that up. You. Calculated that. It almost becomes. Zero. So for starch. The equivalent for glucose or dextrose equivalent. Is almost zero in the lap. If we measured the dextrose equivalent. We cannot just measure the number of reducing and. What we do is we measured a concentration of reducing sugars. And we defied by the total concentration of sugars. So the total concentration of sugar units. Glucose units that are present in the starch solution. And if we defied the two numbers which. Each other. We have to duck through. Equipment. And this is done in research so for example here you have. An investigation of sugar beet pulp. And a sugar beet pulp as hydrolyzed wit an enzyme the enzyme suddenly not. It is done for different concentrations of or loading levels of and zines. Here are two different concentrations. Ten twenty thirty forty sixty. And the hydraulics is done over time is followed over time. And then the amount of reducing sugar. Is measured over time and. The more hydrilla station has been taking place. The more reducing ants are formed. And sort of concentration of reducing and. Is going up. And you can also see that. If the loading level of the enzyme is higher the ends i'm there are more on times present. So also do hydraulics is going faster. So for example if you compared to ten. With the sixty. You clearly see that. The more enzyme that there is for us and. The more reducing sugars are formed over time. Now you've learned about reducing sugars. And how this related to hydrolysis and. I want you to look at these. Starch solutions so imagine you have a starch aleutian. Containing only dissed molecules. And then you have a second starch aleutian. Only containing these molecules. And you have a starch solution would only these molecules on the starch aleutian would only these molecules. What does the d. eat. Of each solution. Make a calculation. Now here are the answers. To calculate did the officer solution. What you have to do is to fight. The number of producing ends all for the total number of cool close units that are present. Now. In this molecule we have one reducing and here. And if you count the number of units. It is eighteen. So to calculate this di you divide one over eighteen. And you multiply it with one hundred. And then you get to deep discharge lucian. And you can do the same for each of them. Here you have only glucose units. So the number of glucose units. So to the reducing ends and the number of glucose units is equal. And that this why did the is one hundred for a pure glucose solution. So to summarize. We've talked about carbohydrate hard for offices. And that they'd like us for that bond. As hydrolyzed it's. It's cleaved. It increases the amount of reducing and we can measure that so we can analyze did the question of the hydro says by analyzing the amount of reducing. Sugar side are formed. And in the case of starch we do this by measuring the deep of that starch solution.",

                "text": "This knowledge clip. Is about reducing properties of carbohydrates. Reducing properties of one of the most important. Properties of carbohydrates. Now to understand what reducing properties are you first have to understand that your gross can be present in an open form. Here in this case you see the equilibrium between two closed forms of glucose the alpha and the beta unaware. Rideau each group is pointing downwards. Or upwards. When the ring. Opens up. These old age group become a double bonus option and other words. The o.-h. group pair. Are free to open up the ring. And the ring then opens up. And becomes a double bond as oxygen. Sometimes this is also represented in this way. But the double bonds it's optional in the first carbon. Now this is very important because this. Double bond is oxygen. Is reactive. When the sugar is in the open ring form. For example my doll reactions or caramel the sation reactions can start to take place. Which are both. Browning reactions in food. But also other reactions can now take part because of this double bond that's oxygen. Now why do we call this so reducing property. And that is because when the sugar is in the open ring form. And you have this double bond the oxygen. Than the sugar can react with cup or. Here you see the copper. And to copper ox tight. So would the sugar is reducing the copper and that is the reason why recall is a reducing sugar. Now this property is used to analyze sugar we'd like to read you some sugar. To react with copper. And then we analyze. The amount of copper that house reacts with the sugars. Here. I have show you different structures of different carbohydrates. And let's see whether they have a reducing and. Yes or no to find out you have to look for that free oh-h. group. Here you see that this monocycle right. Has this free o. h. group. So it's cool pair. The ring can open up. And the age group can become a double bond as oxygen. When you look at this dye cycle right. Then you see that here do all age group. Can open up and become a double one that's oxygen. This. Oh. Oh it's group here. Cannot open up. It's in the structure and the linkage. And the same columns here for this only go second right. This own age group pair is not free. This group is not free. This oh group is not free. But this one here. Is a freak group. And that is what we called a reducing and of the sugar. Now here you have a pollie cycle right. So every zero in the link which is not a free owing cannot open up. Each of these rings. But at the very end. You have one free oh-h.. That's going to open up that ring structure so here you have one. Reducing at and. One reducing unit. Up all these units. Not all carbohydrates are reducing. If you look at for example the cyclic molecule you can imagine that every old group here. Cannot open up the can not the oh-h.. It's not in the each group that can become a double bond as oxygen. So here none of the rings can open up. So this is not a reducing sugar. And when you look a ref in those here. You see again here this is not an free oh age group that can open up the ring or this is not a free. Or age group. So these two rings cannot open up. And here to third one. Then you have to look again at this group. That is so group next to ole. And the ring. And it's connected. So it can not become a double bond as oxygen. So is also not reducing. Rafa knows. Now one of the importance of the reducing property is that you can have a rotation. Here you have fructose in the open form. And when the ring closest. It can close in two different fashions. Here you see them. So via the open structure. It can close for example in this for a note. Then it can open up again and close again. And to apparent almost. Than the paranoias and the alpha can open up again. And become a beta. And it can open up again then close again etc. This property of carbohydrates is called. Retard rotation. So when the frick goes as in solution. Within the solution. It can change from one structure into the other. Fayyad the open structure or only reducing sugars can half this property. Now did you know what a reducing sugar is. So it's a sugar that can open up one of the rings. I have two examples here for you and tell me. Do d. sugars have a reducing group and can be opened up there right now here is the answer if you look at lactose then you clearly see that there is a free zero age group and this so age group can become a double bond as oxygen. When the ring is open. So yes. It is a reducing sugar and yes it can open up one of the rinks. And then this double bond with oxygen. Can start having for example a my ya reaction when you look at second rows. Then you have to look again for that oh age group. But there is no free oh-h. group here. The way or age group was here. Connected in the linkage. So no this ring cannot open up. And also this ring. Cannot open. Up so it is not a reducing sugar. So to summarise. You've learned that reducing properties are of as a very important property of carbohydrates. Reducing sugars can open up the ring because of that open ring it has a double bonus oxygen. That is very reactive. It can have a rotation because of this open ring structure and. The reducing property is used for the quantification of carbohydrates. And at the very end you have to understand that not all carbohydrates. Are reducing sugars.",

                "text": "And this knowledge clip. I'm going to talk about that like acidic bond. Of like a sort of bond as a bond with than a carbohydrates. Connecting the mono cycle rides in the carbohydrate. So for example if you think of sugar sugar it's made of two. Monomers for toes and glucose. And they are bonded with each other like acidic bond. Here you see a model of second rows. So you see different thoughts unit on this site. The ring structure and the glucose unit on this site. The other ring structure and between the two rank structure. You have the. Like acidic bond. The oxygen atom in the middle. If the glucose in the fridge to us units connect with each other so here you have the glucose and here you have to fructose. Than a water molecules formed. That you see here. And then the. Like acidic bond this fort that you see here. Now. Here you see four times. The structure of flecked. It's the same molecule. It's just represented in different ways and. Especially debunk this are presented in a different way. Here you see the bond. Represented in this fashion. Here you see a kind of wave structure. Here it is represented even in a different fashion. And here you see this exact structure. It is all the same bones just represented in the different we. I'm going to explain you how this repressive taishan is built up. If two monomers are connecting with each other for example here you have one one them or and a second. On the mare. Than you have to look really carefully at the position of the o.-h. group. Here you see that's an age group. Its positions and the. Elf opposition. Downwards. Compared to the ring structure here. This is also a group. Is positioned done worse also. It's the second. Muslim or. If they combine with each other than we show it like this with this structure. Now this is an alpha bond. Because this so each group was in the alpha position. If the zero age group. Of the left monomer. Isn't a bad supposition so. Pointing up ports. And for example the muslim way or that it's connecting with the it trip is pointing downwards. Then we show that. In this fashion. So be careful. Don't think that this is a carbon atom. These two points here are not carbon atoms. Now this is a bad end because this zero age group was in the better position. So for example if you look at multiples. Than the melt to glucose units connecting with each other and then. Because this used to be an old age group pointing downwards. It is bonded in the alpha bond. Now related to did like acidic bond uv we can also talk about the systematic name. Off for example dissect right now here you have lactose. Lactose is build up of two units. Gallic toss. And glucose. And the new is point is shown. Down here. It is a bad day. Gal like to a paris pouring the still. One four d.. So a person knows. That difficult name. I'm going to split that out a little bit. First you have to realize. The two units in glucose. And we have to look at the pushing of the age group of. Calicos. Hear that here there used to be an oh age group here. And you see here that it's pointing upwards. So that's the bad supposition. So that is also the reason of the bats are here in the name. Not a thing that you have to look at to switch carbon atoms are connecting with each other now. Maybe you remember. This is to first carbon. The second. The third fourth fifth and sixth. So in this case. The first carbon. Of gallic toes. Is connect with with the. One two three fourths carbon. Of the glucose. You see also here one and four. So it's a connection between the first carbon of the golic toes and the fourth carbon of the cool course. And that is what you see here in the name. Now here we have put the bad time from the. The galaxy it was but we didn't put an l. thought we're about to hear in front of the glucose. And that has a reason. If you look at the glucose molecule that maybe you can see here. That this glucose molecule. Is reducing. Meaning. The ring can open up. And this also means that it can change from an alpha and to have beta and from a beta back into an alpha. So the position of this or age group. Can change. And for that reason we don't give it an alpha or a bates now. Now did q florent about the bond like a sort of bond than about a name. I want you to look at these two structures in this sack are also normal sugar and. And look at it and see if you can find what it what x. y. and z. should be. Now here are the answers. If you looked really carefully then you saw that. This group is pointing downwards. So meaning. Out five. And if you also come to it. Correctly. Then you knew that this was the first carbon. Second third etc. So that is the one. And for the fructose it's a little bit difficult. This was the first carbon. Here. And this is just. Second carbon. There. So that is why it's a one two now. Also. You might think this is an alpha. But if you switch the molecule for you would you realize that it's a beta you have to look at the alpha beta from the other side from the right site. So dismissive beta. Looking at cell o.b.o. this group is pointing up ports. So that's a beta. And then. Here is the first carbon. Connecting with the fourth carbon. Of. This glucose. One two three four. So that is why it's one for. So to summarise. You florent about it like acidic bond. It's a bond between one of sacrifice in the carbohydrate like a sort of bonds is present and dissect rights and. Only go cycle rights and pollie cycle rights. And this systematic name comes from this like a sort of bond. Partly. And it indicates how many units are linked. And whether the link is an alpha. Or a beta. And whether link is a one two or a one four or even a one six or other. Linkages are possible.",

                "text": "In this clip. The definition of public health. Will be explained by the kelp is defined as the science and art of preventing disease. Prolonging life. And promoting health. For the organized efforts of society. This definition is to develop by winslade all in one hundred twenty towards long time ago. But still in use. And we will discuss now. The three elements of this definition. The science and art. The first part. Expressions of health the part in the middle. And the last part the organized efforts of society. Well the health part. There are different aspects of health and. In a definition you saw that it was focusing on. Longer life. Feeling healthy and preventing disease so. No diseases. Well there are different meanings and different definitions of health status. And that's really what's also to discussion is about in the research that. There is not one clear definition there that's discussed over and over again and. Over the years. And then one of the first definitions was to differ finish and by its own that stated that health is the absence of illness. So that's not really a definition of health because it's world. Is health. And it's the opposite. Of health status. In one hundred forty eight. The w.h.o. came up with a more complete definition. Most of improvements. Compared to the previous one and it's was stated as health is the state of complete physical mental and social well being and. Well it was an improvement. And it still was a little of this question about it because especially because of the word complete. Because of what moment the. People at cheve a complete. Health status. With a complete physical mental and social. Yeah well being and health health status. So are this the phoenician was criticized over the years for it. No one came up with better one. And that happened recently in two thousand and eleven. Who birth. At all with a lot of. Colleague from all kind of international organisations. They came up later knew one and that said. Health is the ability to adapt. And self minutes. In the face of social physical and emotional challenges. And the focus in this definition. Was on the personal. On personal character it correctly sticks that people are able to adapt. To specific circumstances. Well a lot of definitions. But health. Is not only objective. And you can measure it you can. Grounded with it his whole sowers subjective component. And that means that people's. For some people. Physical health is much more important than. Emotional health. And also. Group characteristics. Are like age and gender. And kilter. The term only. How people perceive their health status. For example you have all versions. That they have or illness that they say well. I'm still feel healthy. So there is a difference between age groups. And how they weight. The meaning of health. Well that brings us through the second part of the definition. There are organized efforts. Of society. So there are. Many many persons. Many organizations that are active in the field of public health and. They all have their specific role. I mean you can make a distinction between. Are going to say sions there broke on the governmental level. And there are going to stations that group on a non-governmental level and they. And they act on on the local level on the regional level national level or. An international level. I realize this is just in the classification but i think that it will become more clear when we look at the different examples. Well the for example you know i have the. w.a.c. oh. That's an organization that's working on the international level. It's a governmental organization and. Develops all kind of policies. On health status. For different countries for example. In their european union. But also outside the european union. You have the ministry of health and well. Ministry of health is just one example but you can also think of the ministry of agriculture. And that acts on the national level. Of course it's a governmental organization. There are many other organizations like to public health or primary care organizations. Acting on. All national level. Local level. And you can think of. General practitioners. Social services. Health insurance companies are not ration centers and. Well they also have a contribution. In public health and the last one is the industry. You can think of the food industry but also the retail. So many different organizations. Everyone public health and. And they leave. Develop activities or policies. Well what are these organizations doing. Because of this about organized f. So these different organizations. They have a specific role and. Or a specific task. And they can develop activities for the healthy population. They can focus on high risk groups. And they can focus on. Persons with risk factors for diseases for example or for persons that have a diet or a diagnosed disease. I will the last part the last group. Is the group that is covered by the field of medicine so i will not go into death. When you think of a. Fifty's for the healthy populations. And example our disport. Afford lessons at school. And they are developed by. Health promotion organisations in collaboration with its schools and teachers. For high risk groups. You can think of a stop smoking campaign for pregnant women. Most of the time the fellow. But health promotion organizations. But also working to get over it. Social services. Are primary health care. The first group to group with persons who are risk of pacific diseases. You can think of people who have risk factors for diabetes. Persons with overweight. There are specific courses with a crisis for. How to eat healthy and i. To be physical active active and. Well these courses are. Most of the time to fellow. Life fish. Fresh fish your therapist. Ideations. In collaboration with the. General practice and practice nurses and community health services. So many different organizations. Ever have a specific role. And they roped together with other organizations. To set up a public health program. That brings us to the last part of the definition of public health. At the beginning i said. But health is the science and art and. It's a combination of science and art. In public health. Scientists and not artists from it. I mean. Craftsmen an artist also a craft. Something. You can't be very good at it and scientists and cross my work together and. I really like the. Quote from the oxford handbook of public health practice because of very clearly describes what i mean with this combination of science and art. In the oxford. Handbook is stated to public health professional. Needs to work. I condemn a cli that needs to be a civil engineer. So you should be able to. To combine these both. Call it qualifications. And i think this is the. The core of public health that people in different organizations have to work together. And people. Public health professionals. They have to work on the interface between those different domains. So i hope you now have a good understanding. What public health means. And so what.",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this clip about. Change. Objectives. We have already looked at different tasks within step two of the intervention mapping model. We first looked at program. Objectives we have looked at. Performance objectives and. We have looked at how to select. Determinants. Now to last ask in step two is to define your change. Objectives make. Matrices with. Change. Objectives. Change objectives. Describe what people should have learned. After day have participated in a program. In terms of knowledge. Attitudes self ficus e perceived social norms. All these kinds of. Determinants. What do we like to see. At the end of the program. And you can make them by crossing the performance objectives with the. Determinants and. To define or. To describe the change objectives. You can use all kinds of. X. if words like they're also shown here on the. Slight so you use words like describe. Selects compare. Express explain. So it is a very x if. Words. For example. This is and an overview of one of our major pieces in the teenage mothers projects. And there you see for example a community member of can describe the make the truth of the problem. They can express. A positive attitude. They describe it as other community members. Have also changed their attitudes towards teenage mothers. So here at the left you see the. Behavioral out scum. Of community. Membership. Below debts you see. One of the performance objectives. On the top you see the difference. The term an ns and. By crossing to performance objectives with the determinants. You. Writes the change. Objectives. This is another example. For the teenage mothers. Their behavior outcome. Is that they can effectively cope with stigma. And one of the smaller. Performance objectives. Was that they could seek help. Of or counseling. When they would need it. At the top you see the difference. Determinants that were important and changeable. Among the teenage mothers and their below you see all the difference. Change objectives that we have selected for despotic uter performance objectives. In reality we had very long lists of objectives for all the difference talk of groups that were part of the program for the teenage mothers. And all their behaviors. And performers objectives for. School administrators for parents for community leaders. So we had a very long list of change. Objectives. To guide our program design. Because these. Change objectives are the starting points to make your program materials but also to select theories. Of change. For example if you would like to address the change objectives that relates to knowledge. You look at various theories that say something about how can i change. Knowledge. In the best and effective way to change objectives are often based on the evidence and theory including your needs assessment in step one. But also on consensus between stakeholders. So for example we were looking at a very sensitive topic. Of teenage pregnancy. And community members. Felt. Very negative about it so it was a sensitive topic. So we also had to discuss with the different stakeholders. What exactly can we includes in a program. And what not. So at one hand. You look at evidence. What works and what is needed at the other hands it's also something about. Yeah gets a consensus between people about what. Objectives exactly to include. And at the same time. Also whether these objectives. Could be implemented it's whether implementors. Would agree with. Giving certain messages. So it's about evidence. It's about having the commitments of all different stakeholders forder. Objectives. And also whether implementation. Is still going on in practice. And an important tip. When you're going to make these matrices make sure that they are manageable so don't make them. Too big and too large. Because that's a big risk when you are making all these specific objectives. You have to balance. Somehow. Ok in this clip you've learnt about. Change objectives. These are the most details. Objectives. Within intervention that being and how you can make them. Write them. Thank you very much.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this clip about spur firmus. Objectives. Performance objectives are part of intervention mapping step two. Where you define the program objectives. The first task. In this step was to define program outcomes for. Behavior it. Behavior and. Environments. And the seconds. Task is to simply fight these behavioral outcomes into smaller. Performance objectives. That's what we're going to look at say in this case. So what does performance objective is actually a breakdown. Of behavior. It's so. Behaviors. Off. A behavior are scum. And i always use this example. About. When you eat a banana which is a behavior which. So behaviors do you perform in. Eating a banana. There are all different small steps that you take in eating a banana. For example first you have to buy a banana. So that's a behavior in itself. Secondly you have to peel off. The peels off. Of the banana. Then thirdly of course you have to put it in your mouth. So that's another behavior. You can see someone do it. And of course you have to throw away the peel of the banana. So it's about all these different subsets of one behavior. Which are the performance objectives. So you can do exactly the same for all kinds of other behaviors. Both florida. The target group. So what do people who participate in a program need to do. To perform the behavior. But also for people in their environment. Or do they need to do. To perform. The behavior. So it's both order. I was going supporter. Behavior of the target group. But also for the behaviors. Of the environmental. Ector. So this is an example that. We did in uganda in the teenage mothers projects. Here you see that the outcome is stark it it's to school administrators school it made administrative support to teenage mothers to continue their education in school. So what exactly do they do when they support. Teenage mothers well. First they allow them to go back to school. They also. Treats the teenage mothers you know a respectful way and don't stigmatize them. When they are back in school. They also communicates respectful. About the teenage mothers. With others in the school so to sets an example. And it also creates support within the school for example among teachers. So your you see one big. Behavior. Divided into smaller. Behaviors that you would like to see. After the program is implemented. Well why is this so importance. Performance objectives help to make. General behaviors. More specific. For example. When we enter increase support. What exactly do we mean by making it's very specific it's also makes clear. What exactly we would like to see. In the end of the program. There's also holds for all kinds of nutrition programs. If we would like to see healthy food intake. The behavior. What exactly are the performance objectives. So what exactly do we mean with. Healthy food intake. So i did holds for all kinds of behaviors that you would like to change in your program. In the. In addition. Performance objectives. Are often also more achievable. Then the behavioral article and stows are big. Outcomes. Rarest of performance objectives for. Example buying healthy food. It might be something that is more easy to achieve. Then. That someone. Performs. All the different steps and. It's healthy food. So also in your measurements the performance objectives. Are very useful to show any results of your program. Ok so in this clip you learns about its performance objectives. And they are some behaviors. Of the behavioral and environmental outcomes. Thank you.\n",

                "text": "Hello welcome to this clip about stating. Outcomes for behavior and firemen's. Which is to first ask for step two. In the intervention at being a model. Here you see all the for. Difference tasks for step two and the first one is about. Program outcomes. But what you first do is select different starke of groups for your program. In here you need to take decisions about which groups are we going to offer a program which groups are we going to in forth. And give them certain activities. This can be the people who are at risk. In our example it's the. Teenage mothers. But the target group can also be environmental activists. For example parents or. School administrators. And if you have selected. These groups then again. You have to look whether. Within these groups you can select. Sip groups. So do we need to make specific objectives for girls who are younger than. Girls who are a bit. So you look at subgroups. Within your target groups. Or have. Do we need to the fight between mothers and fathers. And for death you have to look at your needs assessments where there are real importance of. Differences there. In our project we select as acquired a large number of groups because we wanted to look at the problem in a very holistic way. So maybe you remember an ecological model where there are differences. Levels. And in the second column. Of this table you see the at risk group. And the environmental agents. So that still about. What is the problem. And that's the third column you see the darker. Groups that we selected for our program. You also see this. These two are nots the same. So for example the fathers of the baby child speer really an importance. Yeah. Environmental effects are that they did not take care of the baby child. But it was very difficult to involve them in the program so today are not part of our troops. And at the same time. We looked at scrum units in members who were stigmatising and it's teenage mothers. They were really an important group. Yeah. Creating a program. That's in that soccer droop. We thought we also need to involve the leaders within the communities. Because they are the. The important people who can also create change. Among the community members. So there you see that's the at risk group. And it's awkward group. Are not always the same. Depends on what is possible in. Program implementation. If you look at the behavioral and her mental. Out scums. Actually you have to ask yourself the question. Which behaviors. Of the adrift. As a risk group. And also the environmental factors. Do we want to see. After they've participated in the program. So in our case for example which behaviors do we want to see among the teenage mothers. And also among people in their social environments like their parents or school administrators or community leaders. So it's all about speed a few years on all these different levels. That you have to state. And again here it is another way of saying exactly the same. You look at speed a federal. Outcomes. For the talk of group. The teenage mothers to people who are at risk. But also to be here for outcomes for people in their environment. And these are also referred to as environmental outcomes. But actually it's all the same it also depends. Only depend. On the group of people that you are targeting. So these are some examples here you see the ecological. Model. For example on the individual level the teenage mothers. We have stated. That's teenage mothers effectively cope with early pregnancy. And with the stigma and other behavior i was going was the teenage mother should continue their education. That's what we want to see. After they participate in the program. On interpersonal level. We look that's the parents. We would like to see that they care for their daughters to teenage mothers and their children at the end of the program then. A level higher on the organizational level we also would like to see that school administrators. Support teenage mothers who want to continue with their education. On community level. We would like this community member support. Ameri to teenage mothers. When they are in their communities. And finally on society level. We would like to see that leadership. Support the unmarried teenage mothers. In all kinds of ways. So these are all examples of behavioral outcomes for a target group of teenage mothers. And for people on all the different levels. In their social environment. Ok so in this clip you have learned about behavioral outcomes for both. People at risk of a certain problem and. People in their environments. On different levels. Thank you very much.\n",

                "text": "You know in this eclipse i'm going to give you an introduction about its intervention at being step two which is about objectives. So where are we. We've talked about the need to system and step one. And now we are in. Step two defining. Program. Objectives. And so wise the importance to define. Specific program objectives and i've looked at. Process. Communication and. Setting the realistic expectations. When it comes to the process it's important to set objectives. Because it's contributes to discussion and is you making. In the planning group. The people that are taking the decisions. About the projects. Because if you make very specific objectives then you have something to talk about actually. Making specific objectives and documenting all of them also helps not so forgets any importance or. Objectives in your list. Then secondly it's important for communication with the people in the planning group. Also with people who are designing the program. Maybe people who make. To fit a video or. Who have to write a text. For your program materials. But also for people outside. The projects like don't our organizations. Finance and thirdly. It's also important so far to sets. Specific objectives. Two sets. Also realistic expectations. Because it makes very visible. What you're going to target with your program and. What nots. And if you know what you cannot target with your program you also know that you may not see. Creates any change there. So it helps to make very clear. What you can expect. After the program is implemented. Ok. If you look at step one and step two in step one you've done an analysis of. The problem. With one of the core elements. Defining risk behaviors of people. And in step two. You will look at the solution. Part of hits. So you can look at health promoting behavior. What our behaviors to people have to do. To have better health or to prevent any health problems. So in intervention mapping this is scalds. At one hence the logic model. Of the problem. And at the other hands. In the objective sparked the logic. Model of change. So what are all the difference elements that you have to do to create change. So you have to make a flip from the problem. To dissolution. And there are different tasks. In intervention in step two. First you look at spro gram. Outcomes for behavior and firmaments second. Cept you fight. Each as come into. Performance objectives smaller objectives den selects important and changeable. Determinants and finally. You make very specific. Change objectives. And these different elements are all explained in different clips. And i'm going to use in all these different clips i'm going to use an example of a project i was involved in which is the teenage mothers projects in uganda. There we also use intervention mapping and. We also defined objectives on all these different levels and. There. We have looked at teenage mother sure have given birth to a child while they were not married. And as a result they faced a lot of discrimination stigma. Difficulties in their coping also with being pregnant and being mother at a very young age. Very often they are dismissed from school so they have to cope with that. And also many many of the. Girls are sense of a by their parents so it's quite a big problem. And we have translated. This problem. Into objectivity what should we do. So improve the life of these teenage mothers. And in practice. We worked with a group of people in uganda. And a planning group. And they were all people from the local community based organisation did not know much about intervention there being. But we did discuss. All the different objectives. In the planning group. But not us. There are states that now any intervention mapping. That was the role of me being the person who knew intervention mapping. Very well so the group discussed about all the most important topics and objectives. And i translated that into intervention that being language. So to say. Well in this clip you have learned about. Objectives. Why they are. Importance and also how. Stating objectives. Is can be done. In practice.\n",

                "text": "And in this clip. I would talk about how you can communicate. Your research result in. During a policy process. And during the policy process. You can deliver. So several. Research projects. You can deliver. Public health. Reports. But also you can make summary. Knowledge chum aris. What we can call. Policy briefs. Another way. And this is a way i really much like. Is to actually become engaged in policy process. By participating in policy dialogues. That means that you will discuss your results with all the stakeholders in a policy process. It is also very interesting as a researcher to count. To try to get a grip on this policy process. We can call this policy diagnosis. As an example. You can conduct the next thing called analyzes. Which policy ector's up dissipating. In this policy process. And what are the stents. What did i think is important and. If you can. Maybe you can even say. If they would like your report or not. If you look at the proses or. Relinking research and policy makers. It can look like this very complicated. And sometimes it is. There is no one way solution. Of getting your resales. Into the policy making process. There are so many differences between. Between the different processes that it is no way that you can find one way to handle it. If you want to get an epidemiology goal. Or research mission on the political agenda. You have to take in account. That there are people who also perceive. The problem that you described really exist. So you have to fit in their personal beliefs. Is this really a problem for then. Yes or no and hope. The more stakeholders believe that. The problem you are describing is actually a problem. This the more likely it is that your research is accepted. But also you have to take into account that. On a policy. Actors have a perception. On this a ferrety. Of the problem. Do they think that this problem is really a problem that should be handled and should be handled right now. Also it is. If a person or a policy actor. Is more likely to be affected by the problem. Directly as that for themselves. They will be more open to accept your research. This is their number nineteen. And why do i put this here. As a researcher. Especially epidemiology just. We are really. Used to work with numbers. We understand numbers. But ninety percent of the. On the people will nurse. Do not look at numbers the same way as we do. If you just look at the figure. Nineteen. It doesn't mean anything. Nineteen is just nineteen. How does a figure get a meaning. Well you can say. All right. This is ninety percent. But still. For ninety percent of the other people. It doesn't still doesn't say anything. Ninety percent. If you say ninety percent. Smokers. Then. Really. They will think. And they will learn how what. Ninety percent smokers. Mean. Ninety percent spoke us. Is that a problem and other people say yeah. Ninety if ninety percent of the population smokes. That can be a less. Or a more severe problem. However if you say ninety percent smokers. Between the age of fourteen and sixteen. And then you say. Is this a severe problem. I bet. A lot of more people will say that this is a problem. What i want to say to you. Is that a number on itself. Doesn't have any meaning for policy makers. You have to give the story surrounding it. By creating the story but create it by using words. The figures get a meaning. And if you want to convince policymakers of a certain problem. You have to make the story. If you want to inform. To persuade to act. And you're presenting your results. You have to take into account a few things. Do you know who you are deities. Do you know what they think. What they want. What they think is important. If you know dad it is much easier to meet their expectations and confines them. That your results. Are rarely really important. Also you have to take into consideration the timing. When exactly do you present this results a lot of time. As researchers we are too late. We have to be. And if you've got a. If you have. If you are in a good connection with a policymaker. During this policy process you can discuss. At what time it is ok. To present your results. People have to trust you as a researcher. If you are not. If they think that you will set them up. Or that you are fraught. Are that they believe that what you have told. Is not true because of a cult like. Maybe has made a not so good to research recently. You know it intrusive and. Influence. This. Your current their trust in you. They have to believe you. That you are a good sign. Sound. Scientists you have to agree. The have to have come from confidential. You have to be show that you are concerned that you understand. The problem. I mean not only from a scientific point of few. But maybe ok. Also from a personal point of view. And most awful if you present your data our your results. Listen. What the people what the audience has to say. Don't get stuck in your own reasoning. But listen. And what their reasoning is and try to meet. This reasoning. If you look at communication of findings and we look at the normal scientific way of doing that. We learn at the university. To write an answer to our diction. Describe the research methods described the statistical methods. Draw results discussion and conclusion. However if you talk to policymakers. Or any on a polished. Actor who isn't in full in research. You can skip a few things. Talking about research methods. Doesn't work. Maybe a few people understand that. But a lot of them. They will miss the boat completely if you start talking about it even more about the statistics. I mean. Be fail use confidence into falls. And doesn't mean anything to a lot of people. Also the discussions and watch we used to do as a scientist. To reflect on our for if i'm wrong. On our findings. For an outstanding are. For a policy maker. It seems that you are discussing your own results. And that your results are not. Ok. And then they don't release you anymore. So you have to find a way to be to get new ones and you will insist on your or your research. It's however you have to be also very direct. So if you want to inform to persuade. To act. And i call this. Evidence. Informed. Bolasie. I mean you have to maintain to focus. What is it what you want to tell. Get quickly to the point. Don't give your results at the end. But you can started the beginning. And also repeat them at the end. That's no problem and ill use the data and numbers of interest to support your story. Not everything around it. I mean sometimes you see these big tables. With a lot of numbers. And an audience doesn't know where to look. It's too much information. So try to keep your numbers. So a small account. Amount of numbers a small as possible so that they can focus on the message that you are bringing be specific and use real world examples. What is happening in the street. And more of all. A lot of people. Think have pest problems. To understand what a percent of teach means. I mean it's much more easy to understand if you have about one percent of the populations. Is five thousand people. I mean. Then. If you talk about five thousand people. People have a picture of the amount. And then they get a sense of urgency or not. So in this clip. I told you a little bit. How you can communicate to your research result. During the policy process. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is joyce huda. And in this clip. I will talk about what you can do during your research research process. To influence policy. Many scientists complaint that they have many good results. And they make. They tell a lot about it. But they don't see that they have any impact. It seems that nobody is using their knowledge. What can you do about it. Well one thing you can do is to organize. Interaction with policymakers. During your research process. Why is that important. Because under beginning of a research process. You start with. Formulating research questions. However you have to be sure that these research questions. Align with the policy questions. Policy makers have. So if you have. If you if you want to influence policy makers. It is really important at the beginning of your research process. To keep in contact with the policy makers. If you start working as a scientist and. In a policy. Environment. It seems that there is a big gap between what is happening in the policy field. And what is happening. And what you are doing in your research field. However if you look more closely. You can see there is a lot of overlap there are are already many connections between you or your fellow researchers and policy makers. However because it seems that you have other interests and. Speak another language. That there is a gap. And there are many things. You can look at. If you are. Act of have. Interaction with policymakers. If you look into the. Overlap of the research field and the policy field. We can see the following model. He just see the research process. On the top. You see the subjects selection. I mentioned this before. It is really important that policymakers know what your research. Questions are and it is very important for you to know if the. Research questions you ask. Aligned with the policy questions. If that goes wrong. You can better stop because you doing work whereas no where nobody is waiting for. If you have chosen your subject. Then you go back to the research field. And do. The thing you learn for as researching for they thought gathering data. And a license. Where you come back in touch with the policy makers. Is in the face or writing this report. As a scientist. You are accustomed to write a report in a scientific way. However for policymakers. That may be understandable not not cannot be understand by a policy maker. Because of the language you use or if you are you write things down. That is not really come in handy. In a policy process. However you have to find a way with policy maker. To write down what you want to ride out. And in a way that it is acceptable for them. If your report is mate. And written. You can work all implementation. You can get more presentations. You can go to different professionals to tell what your findings are. And try. By presenting them. Influence their opinions. And ways in which they want to policy taken place. If you have think. If you have implemented. The research. Or try to implemented. It is. You can evaluate. If you have been successful. If there is anything. Be done with your report. And then you can start again with your subject selection. If you interact with policy makers. As a researcher. There are several barriers that can be mitt. First of all and i talked about this before id expectations. Policymakers. For example can expect that research could shoot can be conducted in three months. Well for many researches that is really a problem. But as a consequence. Research doesn't come on time. So you have to talk enough funds with a policy maker. Are when. Do you need. Results of the research and what you can do. To be in time. Also on the expectation side is. Do you have the right research questions. I talked about it earlier. You can also look at the way you are communicating with policymakers. For example. If i stand for a municipal concert. I can be accepted as an expert but. If you put a professor. Before the municipal council. He has much more. Or to resign and status. That's what he's telling. Is much more easily accepted. But you can also watch your language. Statistical language with specific words you use. Which are not. Which are hard to understand. For policy makers or even other people who are. Not working in your specific research field. You can have to take care about exploitation. Acceptation means that they trust you as a researcher. To deliver good research that it's. Re presents what is extremely happening. If they don't believe you. That you are right. You have a really really big problem. Another thing is what i call. Into potations. People can believe that there are twenty nine percent smokers. In this town. However if a policy maker or politician says like. I believe that this is right and that is. This is actually to situation. Doesn't mean that he feels obliged to do something with it. It can be that he doesn't feel responsible for this problem. And then nothing will happen. With your research results. So how can you keep up that out of the draw or. Work on the management of these expectations. Invest a lot of time on. Before you start your research. In your relation with a policy maker and be that's he or she knows what you're going to do. Think about your communication. Who tells you what about what topic. At what time in the policymaking process. Sometimes people will not believe you. So take personal beliefs into account and. Think ahead about the strategy for interaction which policymakers do you want to fulfill at what time. In this clip. I have told you a little about how epidemiology is can contribute to policy health and health policy process. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is george kuta. And in this clip. I would talk about how. Science can influence policy making. I will talk about different types of knowledge. And i will give you an example. How to niche. National health institute of health. And the environment. Tries to influence. Health policy. On the national level. First of all. I want to show you dispirit as researchers we collect a lot of data. But data itself. To march. To make any sense about therefore. Analyze the data. And then we get the information. The tables. But the tables itself. Needs to be have. Needs to have an interpretation. They have to be meaning about it. So when we do debt. We make. Knowledge. And when we have knowledge. And we have a lot of knowledge. And we can put this knowledge together and weigh them. In finding what is important and less important. We can talk about wisdom. A term you will hear a lot. Is evidence based policymaking it assumes that there is a lot of knowledge available. About public health. And that this gnomish should be used in the policy making process. This is kind of rational. In saying like. This is the knowledge we have and the policymakers should pick it up and put it into practice. However in practice. It doesn't work. Always that way. We have to do a lot of thing as research is. To see that policymakers are using our reports. Assessment reports. We make a lot of researchers we make a lot of assessment reports. To support this policymakers. However. I think most of the time. At the information level and. Do not reach the knowledge level. We make reports about the single target group. About a single problem. And we use. Single source data. When we want to create knowledge. We have to put together different types of into. Information. We have to integrate him. Make an interpretation. Potations. About the whole. Bill. The whole knowledge and putting a meaning to it. As an example. The national health institute for health and refined. Environment. Since. Makes health reports. Since the early ninety's. This was because of an assignment. By the ministry of health. They wanted to know for a few. And the systematic analyzes of. Available information. Of the health of the dutch population. The attendant uses where the policy makers. Of the ministry of health. Regional public health services and health care professionals. In this public health reports and national. There wasn't health. Mobile. Used and it's based on the model. Of the health status is influenced by the. Determinants of health and by profession and care. The health status. It self. Influence the policy. And policy. Influences. The determinants of health and profession. The first edition of the public health report. Was one book with. Eight hundred pages and what's called the bible. It introduced. The health model. The mobile and many many quantity fiftieth information. It was an enormous job. There were very many. Over two hundred fifty. Scientific expert. Experts were involved. However it contained. A lot of information and knowledge. The policy makers were not really satisfied. It was a nice over few. But they were not sure if they could use it. And they find it too. Scientific. So we ninety ninety seven. Second edition was mate. This time it were even more pages through thousands of five hundred pages of information. A real. Library. Several questions were answered. In this edition. What is health. How to measure health. Are there any health. In equities in the netherlands. What about. Effectiveness of prevention and health care about health care costs and. They were in the back at the beginning the most one summary. In which they formulated. Key messages. There were little. Policy recommendations. Because the ministry. Wanted to put the recommendation in their own health policy document. In every way she in the civil servants of the ministry of health. Sat there were still too many pages. But it has to have a different layout it has to be different. The next time. Sort of next time. They wait. They make run reports and. An additional website. Which still exists. There was much attention on lifestyle. International and regional comparisons. And health care performance at the last minute. There was information put in or knowledge put in about the effectiveness of prevention. And there were. And it's the last time. The minister of health was. In time informed about the key messages that they have written. There was still a complaint. In which they were saying like. All right knew. Now we have two less pages. So they still. Developed. They may defer to the full of mint all these reports. The fourth edition. In two thousand and six. Was still one report and a website. And they still gave much attention to prevention. There was a big point of discussion. And that's interesting about about it. The servants and the ministry of health. Was closely in full by the preparation of this report. But they didn't want to work out social economic health this for instance in it. Why. Well it wasn't a political topic and they were afraid that if they put that word in the health report. Wouldn't be accepted by other actress in the field so it was a political item. About that and this is an example. How politics and policy can actually influence. A health report. However there were no further discussions about usability. Of this public health report. So a few years ago. The fifth. Report was made. And they were this were mainly to keep message just because they still use the website. As a background information. And the key mission jews were for example. About the dutch life expectancy. About the diseases are. About healthy environment and. Very important it is it wasn't. Formulated. As a straightforward text but they made. Essays about it. They were more. In a story telling way. And this was also a very new way of presenting. Knowledge. We saw in the last year. Regional and evil and local. Part of this public health report back by. Regional public health services. They made also reports. For local governments. About them units ability. About to health. Health status. And they were regional and local websites were created to give information. And in this way the regional public health services. Try to influence the local policy making. On health. In this clip. I have told you a little bit about how epidemiology or researchers. Can influence or can try to influence the policy making process. By using reports. Thank you for your attention.",

                "text": "Hello my name is joyce huda. And in this clip. I would tell you about health policy making health policy making. Fits in the health policy circle. And if we want to talk about how knowledge. Scientific knowledge is used during the policy making process. We are mainly in the face of. Agenda setting. But we for. We talk about the policy making process. It is important to know how to government. Work on the national level. We have the dutch parliament. These are the elected politicians. And the dutch parliament. Controls. The dutch cabinet. This is the cabinet is the prime minister and his ministers. The dutch cabinet. Is supported by civil servants or public servants. These people prepared the policy decisions and execute. The policy. On the local level we see pretty much the same. However the names are different. Instead of the dutch parliament. We talk about the municipal council. But the. Us are also elected officials. Instead of a dutch government. We speak of the major and elmo band and. The major and elements are also supported by local servants in health policy circle. We can distinguish. Different faces. First of all we have to preparation face. In which the policy. Is set to the agenda. Set for the policy. It is mainly. But burying and. Deciding what the problems are. That should be handled. Then we get a development. Face. In this face. It is set. What. How did the problems will be handled in what way. And what the means are that can be used. Then we get to. Implementation face. There is the policy program. Implemented. And the last face. You can call it if you ration face. Where is the look backed. However if we rent and. If the policy should be adjusted. The dutch national health institute for health care health. And the environment. Prepares scientific reports. To influence the agenda fitting face. They make a report in which the main. Health problems are described. The ministry of health. Rights based on the report of the dutch national health institute for the environment free press a policy memorandum. A policy document. In which the problems. They will handle. Are described. Then this is the policy document of the national government. Is used by local governments. To make their own health policy. And they write also own policy documents. Therefore and. In the last face the health inspection rates. Controls the municipality. In which their goals are achieved or not and. This information is also we're used by the researchers. Of the health institute for their scientific report. Whether the polish. The policy. On the dutch. Level on the national level. Or the local levels. Should be adjusted. Receipt that. In all these faces. You get a timeline. Over the years. So why do we need a policy. Anyway. What is a policy. Exactly. Well there are different definitions for it. It is every. A government chooses to do or not to do. This is the oldest definition. It is. It has to policy has to do with a set of interim interrelated decisions that test to be made by. Groups of political actors and. There has to be a selection be made about the goals and the means. And also you have to take into account which. Actors will participate and what power they have this set of extras are dealing with a bit of the problem. And this problem is related to the common good. It has to do right. To the society and. Also it is defined. Policies defined as the intentions choices and actions. Or one of more a. Been a straight of policy experts aimed at steering at the social societal to full it meant. So do the follow up meant of our society. There is one famous mobile. Of policy making and. It resembles the model. I have explained before. But this is more a little bit more tea towels. You see. The agenda setting face you see a face off. Problem. And a license and policy designed. Then you have to for bolasie formulation. In fact. Decisions are made or what. We going to do or not and then the policy is implemented. After that. Monitored and evaluated and may be adjusted or not this is what's called the reserve russian role model. Of policy making. However if you look to practice. It isn't that. Rational at all. Where in directional model you see. Sequence. Soup sequential steps. One step for us and then the other. In practice you see that sometimes. Tips are taking back because the problems are not clearly defined or may be another extra steps in who has an odd problem definition. Or. There is a disagreement between the actress. About what should be done about the problem. That sometimes when you are in the policy formulation face. You have to take a step back to the agenda setting face. Even so. Sometimes we see in the policy implementation face. That some things we had figured out before don't work in practice. And then they go straight back through the agenda setting. Or the problem analyze this and start all over again. This is what we call the incremental. Policy versus. This is not a look at. Policy process. Sometimes some people call it also to political approach. A political stand a few. But incremental policy process is mostly used. Some people no would call it even a garbage can. But this is about put everything together. And shake it. Orange. If you look at the core elements of. Policy. We can see for. In what face. You are. Of a policy. We always see. For fink's. When you make a policy it is always important. What. The problem is you have to know what the problem is this is one thing that people have to agree on. It is really important. Who is able to talk. Within this policy process. Who makes the decision and what power do they have. It is also very important. That's all. There will be talked about how are we going to solve it. And that there is some kind of agreement on what you should do. And finally there is this the four core element of a policy. Is the context. The context in winced the policy. Is taken place for. Ample. If you look at the local. Policy. It is influenced on what is decided on a national level. If you look at all coal. For example. A municipality. Decides on what times. The cafe should be closed. However there are also all kinds of national rules that are taken into account when this policy. Is carried out this clip. We have showed you a little bit about. Public health policy making. In the next three clips i will show you what you can do. As a researcher as an epidemic little. Epidemiology is. To influence this policy. Thank you for your attention.",

Is based on the research that is conducted for a municipality in the netherlands. And the data are based on literature of research and interviews with professionals. Depression is a major problem. Among teenagers in teenagers. Around fifty percent of children young adults have feelings of depression. And this is a quite stable trends over time and the consequence of the oppression is that these teenagers have difficulties at school. And later in life they have difficulties in finding a job and dating a job. That affects their social life and. Once been through an episode of depression leads. Of increase your chances for recurrent. Episodes later in life. So what are determinants of the pressure. What an important risk factor is a lower education. No educate. The teenagers have a higher prevalence of depression than higher educated. Teenagers. You see a difference by gender. Girls with more depression then boys. We see a difference by age. We see relationships with relational problems especially when. Barons have. Relation problems or when there is a problem between the child. And their adult. Physical and sexual abuse. Is a risk factor. All the risk factors are pure logical factors. Genetic predisposition. Predisposition. Serious life if fans are related to depression like the loss of a family member or. Illness or family member. Tional characteristics like varying. Self esteem. Are related to depression. Lifestyle factor like the use of troops is related to depression and. Local friends. But they're also protect effectors relates to depression. Some of these factors are related to your personality like this. Your sense of humor. Your social skills. And some of these factors are related to your lifestyle like being. Doing sports or. Physical activity. Well we did also into fuel spirits professionals and. The results of these in the fewest confirmed what we found from in the literature. We see that. The force problems are related to depression. Also. Loneliness or social isolation. But also some new. Determinants for mentioned like. The pressure to perform that this. Perceived by a teenager's. Well if you have to give care of home. Bullying at school. And most striking lack of a listening ear. And that means that when there is no one a round. Then there's no one to talk to and it's a real. That's a risk factor for depression but also. And a person that is around. It has not yet been added to listen. Or you can't. Group. All these different determinants and. Christer them. Into specific categories. On this. Sheet you see that. For example self-esteem sense of humor social skills. And worrying. They are all related to your personality. So we combine them in one group. You see at the right side that. Gender genetic the predisposition. Physiological factors and aids. Can be combined in a group of by a lot. Factors. Lifestyle factors our use of tricks and sports. And we have a lot of determinants that are related to the environment. And some of the factors are related to your family and firemen and others to your friends. And your peer group. Well in this clip. You have learned what determinants of health. Are and how you can trust them into perhaps.",

                "text": "In this clip i will show you how to public health cycle. Works in practice. The example that i will show you is based on my fellow information on smoking trends and policy measures. As you know do the cost of health cycle consists of four stages. Starting at the top the first state agenda setting. Following by. Program the fellah bent for state's implementation. And then. Evaluation. And then start all over again with agenda setting. Program the philip went and saw. And this cycle is turning around and around for this example we go back to the year one nine hundred fifty. And in that year. The researcher and. You begin melodist. So rich a door. He identified. The biggest lifestyle. Course of cancer. At the smoking. And thus a new finding for the time and he founded by coincidence. And then. In the years that followed. The research was repeated and. The results that paul has found was confirmed by all the researchers. But it took years before action was taken in one nine hundred fifty two. The first chancellor. Raised taxes on tobacco and that lead it to a decrease in the back of sales. And also to a decreasing trend in smoking. In the netherlands. Going from. Sixty percent in one hundred fifty to forty percent. In the eighty's. In the years that followed a new campaign started to discourage smoking. For specific target groups for example for pregnant women and also for smoking regulation was introduced and. It started with the introduction of the ban on smoking in. But every us. First in workplaces. Followed by train stations. And then forward. Recently. The banning smoking was introduced in bars and restaurants. And this needed to further decrease in tobacco sales. And also to decrease in trenton smoking. Going from forty percent. In the eighty's. To twenty five percent in two thousand and eleven. So where are we now. In two thousand and ten. In the netherlands. A liberal government took office. And. The new minister of health. She refers to. Part of the. Policy measures that were introduced by the previous minister. She cancelled. The interdiction of the ban on smoking in bars and restaurants. She removed the effective treatment of tobacco addiction. From the health insurance packets. And she also decided to say. Stop the funding for. Expert center on smoking in that let's all this government and of the. Earlier than expected in two thousand and eleven. And it was replaced by a liberal social government and there. We first part of the year. The measure stepped where. Interview was the result of this. These actions were dead. For the first time in years the number of smokers. Is increasing in the netherlands. It's going to twenty six percent. So we are now at the fairly interesting point in time. We see that a dick using tents and smoking is flattening or even for the first thing. And there is a lot of debate going on between the political parties about. If we should maintain expand. Adept or terminate the program. And the important question now is is the government intervention still required. Or should people take their own. Response. Ability. And in public health. It's all about this type of questions. So in this clip. I've demonstrated you to public health cycle. And how you can use it in practice.     ",

                "text": "In this knowledge clip. I'm going to explain you with carbohydrates are. Carbohydrates are main of the food components next to proteins and lip it's. Now first i want to show you a few carbohydrates. We also call them sucker writes very often. For example in jam. You have to second writes glucose for. Second rose which is also normal table sugar and. A jelling agents which is also a second right as a police check right back than. That and many fruits and vegetables we have. Glucose and fructose and secor also again. But that we also have for example the police like right silos. Pectin. That is present in both in the cell wall of many fruits and vegetables and. You can also think of starch. That is a political write in. But not us. Another example is milk milk contains the. Lactose right. And sometimes also other second right. And then you have the example of potatoes. Potatoes contain of course starch. But it's also ok it contains an old. That is called. Rough in the us. And it also contains again the style of those in the pact and in the cell will. Now. What are psycho rights from a structure point of view. Here you see an example of clue cause and fructose. And if you look at the molecules. You might notice one important thing. And that is that they are both a ring structure. These rings consist of car bones. And one. Oxygen atom. And then there are many crips connected to these rings. You might also see that these carbohydrates consist of carbon hydrogen and oxygen. The three atoms. Now look at this by secretary. It also consists of rings. You know you see that there are two ring structures. Connected to each other. And then the. Example of. Half a notion to see three rings. That are connected to each other to give you a classification of carbohydrates a monocycle rights. You can look at this table and you see the deficient of monocycle rice. Only go second rights and police second rights. And that is based on the number of units. Monocycle rights have one. Sugar units a one ring structure. And we have seen examples of glucose and fructose. We call a cycle ride and. Only go cycle right when it consist of two to. About twenty units. Connected to each other. We have seen the example of the dice cycle right. Psychoses the dice cycle right because it's consists of two units connected to each other in this case it's a good cause and effect us restitute. Lactose in milk. Is also a di cycle right. And then it contains and of course. Now. There are also a try cycle right. Try second writes have three units. Rafa knows was an example. When we talk about polar cycle right. We have about more than twenty units connected to each other now starch isn't a good example of that it contains up to sixty thousand units. Connected to each other and these are all glucose units. Just so subtle. Also glucose students connected to each other. But then. Often a little less units connected. But they're connected in a little different way than the starch. And then the packed in also an example of a polish like right. It contains less units than the starch in a sudden loss. But in this case you have different kind of rested use like throwing acid ran those arab noses. Kalak toes. That's not true. Now secularize have different roles in our food.
